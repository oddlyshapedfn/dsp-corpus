This one goes out to Blaziniflo.

Q: Why are you so gay? Why do you make 47 threads a day on SRK and then ask why it’s flooded with bullshit? More importantly, why do you start threads like “EC Team” and “ECC grudge matches” and this one, and talk like you’re somebody important? When was the last itme you were good at anything, or did anything constructive for the SF community?

Oh wait, I can answer this myself.

A: Because you’re a loser with no life.

Nuff’ said.

In response to Infinite:

The vids weren’t put up because they weren’t mine. Neither were the ones from CTF. I have an analog camcorder thats a bitch to encode on a computer, so I rarely use it. The first time it was Ryan who quickly encoded the vids and sent them to me. Then I sent to FMJ and had them hosted, and linked on top haters. I really did nothing to produce that first batch of videos.

The vids from the Break triple-threat were Kong’s. Kong doesn’t even have a computer and wouldn’t be able to upload them. I asked him for over two weeks for the camera, and he finally gave it to me during the third week. Then I realized why he hadn’t wanted me to put up the vids so fast: The quality sucked. Worse than my analog cam. I think his digital camcorder is old or fucked up or something, but whenever he recorded on the big screen at the break, there was major distortion. So much that it wasn’t even worth encoding them because it was so blurry and shitty. I would have loved to encode them and especially the Sanford vs Justin finals but they were just too ugly to bother with.

What’s strange is that the interviews came out fine. Anything AWAY from a game screen looks good, but all the game footage was shitty as hell. It would have been pretty pointless for me to encode interviews that relate to a grudge match with no/bad footage, wouldn’t it?

Now to Blaziniflo:

I’ll play you at ECC for any amount of money. You name it and I’ll match it. You are such a guaranteed win that I’m not even going to front: if you play me, you’re done.

Now shut the fuck up, scrub.

uuuuuuuuh…

Sorry, I’m not afraid of this nerd. I’ve seen him IRL and I was less than impressed. The fact that he wants to “anal rape me at ECC” leads me to believe some other things I’d rather not think about.

His threads aren’t funny anymore. The first 1 or 2 were funny, but that was it. He’s just trying to spam his way into SF stardom or something. Okay, one interview a week or two, that’s fine. But he’s just gotten out of hand…this is what happens when idiots are allowed to do whatever they want. What’s next? “Blaze asks Em: Why does my penis have this red rash all over it? STD help thread!”

Sabre has warned him to cut the shit but he doesn’t listen. It’s a matter of time before he gets banned. I dont’ care, I just don’t like to see his shit spammed all over the place. It hurts my eyes frankly.

Justin is just looking for attention. But he’s going to end up getting the wrong kind if he keeps it up.
