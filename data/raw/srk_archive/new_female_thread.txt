well to be quite honest Phil…I’m broke as all hell…and not just I don’t have any money for another pack of smokes either…I’ve got student loans and regular bills to pay off so I’m not going anywhere for quite some time. unless of course I win the lottery in the next couple of days :smiley:

…and that fulfills the assinine post quota for the day.

You’re a homosexual male, what are YOU doing posting in this thread? You’re not going to get any nookie from the “one or two males” who post in here a day, just so thats clear.

Flamers come in all shapes and sizes, and I guess you can only avoid them for so long. Hopefully not all the posts in this thread will end up so idiotic.

So you guys are making a website for yourselves? Sounds good. By the way, is anyone planning on attending Midwest Championships in a few weeks? A lot of the major gamers from both the East and West will be there, may be a good opportunity for some of you ladies to meet some of the best there are in the SF community these days…not to say that you’ll be impressed by the smelly, dirty, greasy and nerdy types that are out there right now, lol.

<-------Exception to that rule, lol.

Jeanatte is a fucking dope name, even if it is spelled wrong. You try intimidating people with a name like “Phil”…why do you think I chose such a dark alias to go by in the SF community? My name doesn’t fit me at all IRL.

What happened at MWC? I expected to at least see a few of you ladies there, and the only girls I saw were either 1. playing bemani games hardcore or 2. there was a girl who was the GF of some guy from Michigan. Besides that nothing. BLAH another sausagefest!

I have no problems with any of those besides 10 and 12. Maybe if women knew HOW to parallel park I could keep quiet, and shopping is the most boring thing EVER just make up your MINDS!!!

lol no hard feelings babe, just joking for the most part. Just that my mom can’t drive for shit and it freaks me out when she tries to park. As for the shopping stuff, I can actually stand it for about 1-2 hours as long as the girl has taste and I’d actually want to see her in the clothes she’s trying on, lol. But theres nothing worse than a woman shopping who’s looking for that ONE item that you know doesn’t exist…

I’ve made my fair share of mistakes in life, and I’ve learned a thing or two about how to deal with them. Most important is to learn from them and not repeat them. That’s the part you can control. What you can’t control is if this girl goes around spreading rumors and talking shit. You could go around trying to create a counter-campaign disproving what she says, but in all honesty it’s not worth it. It will just make you look desperate to protect yourself, and guilty. Chances are that if this girl keeps going around making insults and comments, and her friends do as well, people will begin to think that she’s the idiot for going on about it. Best thing you can do in a situation like that, is let it die. Don’t talk to her, don’t talk ABOUT her, just pretend she doesn’t exist. Do whatever you must to erase her from your life. Block her on IM, change your phone number, whatever. I did that once and it worked wonders. Important thing to remember is 1. it’s not the end of the world, 2. it will eventually die out and be forgotten by all, 3. there are a million other chicks out there who won’t do that to you and 4. it’s not worth getting worked up about. Just some dumb broad who won’t mean a dime to you in the long run. Just chill out and stop stressing about it.

I used to be like you, with pent up anger that I thought would explode at any second, maybe hurting somebody who doesn’t deserve it. Then I adopted a new attitude. I’m now more easy-going, a lot less worrysome, and I have a new perspective on life in general. Nothing, when it comes down to it, is really a big deal when it comes to the big picture. Yes, this issue with this girl may cosume your every waking moment now, but in the big picture it’s really insignificant and stupid. Why get yourself worked up when you have school, work, friends, and a shitload of other stuff to occupy yourself with? In a week or two this isn’t going to matter anymore. She’s just a girl, and she sounds like a real waste of life at that. To quote my good friend Rob Van Dam: “Whatever.” It just doesn’t matter. Let her and her friends go do whatever they want, you have your own life to attend to, and you’re not gonna live in the past.

Just a bit of friendly advice. God, I haven’t been to this thread in ages, and probably never under this nickname. The things you do at 4:48am when you’re bored :cool:

The girls in this thread obviously want attention. Or else, why start a thread titled “new girl gamers thread” in the first place. You know you’re going to attract the attention of legions of horny guys, whether you like it or not. So you have to deal with the idocy of whever comes in here from time to time, it’s just the consequence of drawing attention to yourselves by starting your own gender-specific thread. Similarly, if I started a thread titled “sexy bodybuilding guy’s thread” i’d have to expect legions of horny women and/or gay men to be harassing me constantly. It’s just a side effect of drawing attention to yourself.

With that being said, the “girl gamers calendar” idea is the most stupid fucking thing I’ve heard in a LONG time. If it’s not the most obvious attempt of some horny motherfucking pervert to get some pix of these female players, then I don’t know what is. Bottom line is, sadly, this: most female players aren’t good looking anyway, and the ones that are, well, they wouldn’t give you horny bastards a second glance if you were the last man on earth. So get off the fucking calendar idea and go get a real girlfriend. Or go jerk off. Just leave the ladies alone.

I hope that there will never be mention of the calendar idea again in this thread, because I just squashed it. Sorry for the hate, ladies, but that’s what I do.

I just posted something in another forum, that relates to women. When I wrote it, something had struck a nerve, and I was pretty pissed off. I don’t want any of you girls here to think that I’m writing about you, because I really don’t know any of you well enough to make a judgement call (well, 99.9% of you anyway), so don’t take this personally. It’s just that every woman I’ve ever known has let me down. Anyway, I just wanted to see what you guys thought about what I had to say. Here goes:

—There are really “truly interesting and wonderful women?” Shit, every woman I’ve ever known was either

1. Extremely selfish and self-centered
2. Too busy feeling sorry for herself to do anything else
3. Too annoying and/or geeky to stand for more than 30 minutes
4. Too stupid to listen to advice they ASK FOR, doing stupid things and then complaning to you because they went totally against what you told them
5. A total slut
6. A total tease, leading you on and then crushing you under their boot when you finally let on that you like her
7. A total liar
8. So demanding that she expects you to read her mind like some kind of fucking psychic, and NEVER do anything unless it’s with her (don’t be fooled, if she says you can go do something and she doesn’t mind, she’s LYING and you’ll pay for it later!)
9. Too full of herself
10. Just plain fucking crazy.

Every single woman in my life fits one or more of the above, and every single one has let me down.

You want to know why so many guys are so “uninteresting, full of themselves, thinking they are the shit?” BECAUSE WOMEN DEMAND IT. If a guy has no confidence, then that’s no good. Women always whine they want “a nice guy” and there are none of them left. Give me a fucking break! Women WALK ALL OVER nice guys, use them, abuse them, play with their hearts, but in the end they ALWAYS fuck them over (cheat on them, break up with them, tell them “lets just be friends” or you “need tim eapart” but then run off with some other guy, blah blah blah). The fact of the matter is, the women of America have become so fucking selfish, dishonest, and full of themselves, they have no fucking idea what it is they really want from a man. This is why so many guys have become that same “overconfident asshole”…because if we’re nice guys, we get walked all over, and thrown away, because we’re too “boring” or whatever other stupid fucking reason you give. At least if we act like total dicks, we can get laid once in a while.

Damned superficial bitches. If you could make up your fucking minds what you wanted out of men, maybe more guys would try to be like that. But instead, you’re never satisfied, and you go on forums complaining that “all guys are the same overconfident assholes.” Well maybe if you weren’t sleeping with or dating that type of guy, and/or cheating on/turning down that “nice guy” for that asshole stereotype you so loudly proclaim to be bad, so many guys wouldn’t be trying to be like that in the first place. Dumbass!

So yeah, poon is good, video games are good, but women are a fucking waste of time and the #1 cause of bullshit and drama that men don’t need.

Edit: I don’t think I’m some charming conversationalist or some super genius, because I gave up on impressing women and bending over backwards for them. Now I’m just a dick. Can you guess why?—

Again, don’t take the above personally. But you can’t deny that a lot of what I said there has to be true. Any comments?

I posted that here because it seems to me that for the most part, intelligent women post in this thread, and I was hoping for a female response (or explanation?) for some of the behavior I mentioned. Like I said, don’t take any of it personally, because I was just in a bad mood when I wrote it.

…but can someone here explain to me why EVERY woman I’ve encountered is one or more of the above? Or why women always say they want “nice guys,” but then seem to act otherwise? I’m not just talking about women I’ve been in relationships with, I’m talking about friends, relatives, the (ex)girlfriends of some of my male frineds, and hell even my own mother. I swear to god, every woman I’ve ever known has acted like this, and it’s VERY disheartening. Sometimes I think my standards are just too high, but I’m also not the kind of person to just “settle” for someone. But as it stands now, I don’t think I can ever really trust a woman again, because of the stuff that has happened in my past…
