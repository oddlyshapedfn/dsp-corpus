What is up with all this controversy about who is gonna be on team WC? They are gonna lose anyway to THE BEST GODDAMN MARVEL TEAM, PERIOD. Even if you squeak by everybody, no one is gonna beat Justin at this tournament…

…you might as well have some random bum join in your 5th spot, because nothing is going to help you, lol.

Okay, so I was just checking the official rules, and I found something disturbing.

It says that each EC player will have to basically fight FIVE matches in a row. That’s FIVE grueling matches vs. the West Coast’s absolute best players, five different playing styles, back to back.

This is ridiculously wrong. First of all, after the first match the WC players can pretty much read your style. By the 3rd or 4th match, they’ll probably know exactly what you’re going to do, since they just saw you play 2-4 times in a row. Come on now.

On top of that, you can’t possibly expect someone to play FIVE of the toughest MvC2 matches in their playing history, against FIVE different players/play styles, back to back. They need a rest, especially if they just had a draining super-close game.

I seriously suggest we look into re-ordering these matches so that, at least when it can be avoided, NO players have to play back-to-back matches. That way, everybody gets a chance to rest, nobody is tired out and makes dumb mistakes, and nobody can “read your style” because they just saw you play 4 games immediately beforehand.

Here’s a really easy solution: let’s cut all this kiddie crap with name calling, threats, and bullshit. This was a good thread until you guys stunk it up. DEMON HYO, MIXUP, YOU BOTH SUCK OK. Brandon’s only good character is Iron Man, and Mike can’t survive without Magneto. You’re both one-character-wonders talking pointless shit to each other, and I doubt either of you are going to be selected for team EC if you keep up this childish buillshit. Now grow up and cut the crap.

On a more serious note, can we please get back to the topic of what people think about the fact that the East Coast players have to face FIVE opponents back to back, and if you think that will affect their gameplay in anyway. I’m interested to hear what the players themselves have to say.

Sigh Why do I even bother. I see the posters of this thread, including the top players, are more concerned with the stupid EC vs EC hate and “whos getting the fifth spot,” rather than the fact that you have to play five matches in a row, or that the other team will know your playing style, because of the strange match order. Whatever. Just don’t complain, or start controversy, when you lose and then blame it on “playing so many games in a row” or “getting your style read.” When it comes to anything important, like actual STRATEGY, I can see the East Coast is as un-unified as ever.

Good luck beating the best the West has to offer BACK TO BACK, boys. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Sorry, I must have missed that one in the 56 other pointless shittalking posts you made. Just trying to get this crap OFF of this website and onto one that will gladly host it.

Picolo: mine was better. The one-character-wonder one.
