There were a lot of reasons people didn’t come to this tournament. First and foremost, you moved it from an area close to Chicago, a major city, and a place where it’s been for years, and moved it to some hole-in-the-wall Nebraska location, because the tech was on vacation last year and Nebraska kept bitching about 3s. Bad idea. Use your head, Jason.

Glad I didn’t come. Wilson talked crazy shit about how at MWC, the ST comp is so instense, Cole would NEVER win it. Looks at ST results :lol: If I was there I’m sure I’d have to play Spence twice for some stupid reason anyway and get peaced out like usual. 27 players for CvS2, must have been intense! GGXX won with the worst character in the game! Four REAL marvel players actually show up for marvel!

If I were you, I’d rename this tournament “Nebraska Cornhusker Championships” so as to not leave this stigma on the real MWC next year.

If people are saying that sticks sucked just because they were switch, that’s really fucking lame. But if shit was really fucked up, at a major, that’s inexcusable (but not the first time it’s happened at any major).

Jason, I’m not trying to get attention; if I were, I’d change my nick to DSP and spout out top-haters.com propaganda all day long. I just didn’t appreciate all the shittalk you spouted out on IRC about how ST @ ECC was a non-skillfest, when your own tournament sucked. Low turnout, fucked up controls, and complaining that nobody came when you moved it to the middle of nowhere didn’t help either. Also having NO spare 360s was a BIG mistake…and not having 360s for the games that are accustomed to using them (MvC2) was a big no-no. Switch on ST is okay, but when you’ve been playing MvC2 for 4+ years on 360s, you begin to depend on them.

Ever since last year, I thought you were cool; but then when I started to say I was a top ST player on the EC, if not THE top player, you flipped and started acting like an ass. Who is better than me, then? Ricky Ortiz, Spence who always beats me but loses to certains character for free, and Henry Cen. Considering I play the game seriously three to four times a year at most, and I wasn’t OG like you guys and don’t have those years of experience to fall back on, I would say that’s pretty damn good. But god forbid a player who was born after 1980 say he thinks hes good at a game pre-Alpha 3. The fact that you even played ST back when switch sticks were still the standard speaks volumes. But I never asked to be ranked in your shitty “Tricks and Trips” magazine, so I don’t understand why you acted like you did. Maybe if you seriously did get off of Watson, Ricky, and Gee-O’s nuts for a few minutes, you would realize there are other players.

At least Cole respects me for learning the basics and winning with an obscure character like Blanka. I’m sure if I played O.Sagat all the time like Ricky I would destroy 99% of my opponents too. I’m also sure that if I was a bum like him, I’d have way more time to play SF. Unfortunately, I also enjoy the fun factor of SF, which is probably why I’ll never be a top player. Of course, when you foolishly open your mouth on IRC and then get caught out online because 1. your tournament sucked and 2. you dissed EVERY ST player in attendance at ECC, it makes it all that much easier to be a top-hater.

P.S. When we do play ST, you can hook it up with Pac-Man sticks, since I’m sure that’s what you’re more accustomed to, old man.

I have to agree with Jason here that 360s are garbage and switch sticks are better. Connecticut had switch sticks up until a few months ago, so I’m used to playing MvC2 on both types of joystick, and I have to argue that although 360s are more responsive (just slightly move in a direction and your character responds), switch sticks are more accurate. Why? Because SF is and always has been an 8-direction game. You don’t need 180 points of control, you need 8. Why do you think SO many people get Magneto’s air “boomerang” projectile while trying to triangle dash? It’s because on 360s, there are about 40 more points of movement detection up there that register…the sticks are so sensitive, that if you pressed, down->up to superjump, then tapped down-toward plus two punches to airdash, chances are the stick “brushed” up against some of those up-toward direction registries, giving you that rather useless projectile and costing you a free combo attempt.

Try triangle dashing on a switch stick (after a little practice, of course) and notice the difference. Also, try blocking Magneto rushdown on a switch vs a 360 and you’ll REALLY begin to understand the difference when you can snap to those corners and avoid getting high-low tricked to high heaven. The fact of the matter is, about 25% of the time you snap to back or down-back on a 360, you get a backdash, jump back, or normal crouch rather than a block; on a switch you’ll get what you wanted about 95% of the time.

Now, this is all providing that people were just complaining about switch sticks that worked. I have played on some SHIT switch sticks in my lifetime, so I know how horrible it can get.

Random people coming out of the woodwork to diss me, lol, what else is new? I WAS top 5 in MvC2 on the EC, yeah, like maybe 3-4 years ago. Now there are about 8000 hardcore MvC2 players so I’m not stupid enough to claim something like that. As for ST, some of the people you mentioned I’ve beaten in tournament, some have beaten me, some have gone both ways, and some I’ve never even heard of, or just haven’t played recently. MAYBE if you showed up at ECC, and saw me win $250 for playing pretty shitty (I was off my game due to no practice), and then saw me tearing it up outside on the casual setup, and then saw my team get second place in the team tourney, losing only to TEAM GOD (Seth/Julian/Cole), then I think you would sing a different tune.

But let me put it short and sweet: you were not there @ ECC, or if you were, you were blind. Therefore, GET OFF ME SON, YOU DON’T KNOW ME! It’s idiots like you trying to flame that GIVE ME ATTENTION YOU THINK I SHOULDN’T GET, in the first place.

ahem

I do think I recall that Wilson posted pre-MWC 2002 that 20% was to be kept, and I had no prob with it since it was pre-announced. I could be wrong though, but I’m pretty sure I would have flipped out if I found out afterwards.
