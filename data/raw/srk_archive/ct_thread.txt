Does Danbury still play? I never hear from these foos. They need to come to FYE on a Friday or Saturday and get dominated by my team Row.

Blah blah blah.

When I have no idea who the majority of the people in this thread are, and I’m probably the second-most OG player in CT, you know there’s something wrong. Get a life and stop talking shit, or else beat somebody before you start flapping your mouths.

Fucking CT is alive again!

Listen up, I’m unemployed and I’m bored out of my mind. I’m down anytime to play ANY Capcom fighter, but keep Slash away from me, that shit is gay.

I heard people have been playing at Whats Your Game, wtf why did nobody tell me. I’m in Bridgeport a few times a week anyway. I’m also down to go to these “gatherings” that people are telling me about, and also to have people come over my place to play if they want. I live in New Haven a few blocks away from all the clubs.

SO WHAT IS UP???

>    Damn Phil whats with you trying to prove masculinity, every damn post I read has homo in it.

>    Don’t be hatin on my game just because you cant’ play it.

Unfortunately CT is full of unreliable gamers. Case in point: Everybody shows up at What’s Your Game at 10:30pm and nobody wants to pay to play. Instead, everyone convinces me to leave and we go back to my apartment in New Haven and play for free until 8am. I’m not complaining, I needed the practice, but the fact of the matter is that very few gamers are serious enough about SF anymore to care.

Yet, if it’s FREE they’ll play all friggin’ night.

As much as I’d love to get things going again, I don’t see it happening. Having a few console setups at What’s Your Game is nice, but I really doubt that Neil (the owner) is going to end up making any money on it, or that anyone will consistently start coming to play 3s on that cabinet either. It’s great that he fixed it, but with consoles that you can play on FOR FREE, why would anybody pay to play?

Plus you’re forgetting the biggest problem: CT is, and always has been, primarily MvC1/MvC2 players. Very few people in the state are willing to try anything new. In fact, the ONLY players here who have even tried to play other games are myself, Walter, Ryan, Dru, Tony Barnage, James Austin, and Josh. And of course Nestor when he considered himself from CT. Since 80% of that list lives over an hour from What’s Your Game, and we ALL own PS2s, I doubt that we’re going to get anything going without having an MvC2 cabinet there.

The reason people eventually stopped going to What’s Your Game wasn’t because the arcade scene was dying, but because Neil stopped having people repair the MvC2 machine. EVERY time we came in it was broken, so we had nothing to do. Neil’s major problem is that he’s wishy-washy…at one point he was gung-ho for getting every single fighting game, then he didn’t want to buy anything. At the time of Super Street Fighter II/Super Turbo he wasn’t buying anything at all (that’s why What’s Your Game never had those machines), but then he buys massive quantities of Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, and other stuff. Then again, when CvS1 came out, he took forever to get it and then fell victim to it being one of the worst fighting games in history. He then bought Dead or Alive 2 for some god-awful reason and lost a lot of money on that.

What’s Your Game finally fell off when Neil bought SvC. Nobody told him to, but he just did. I tried to get people to start coming again, so we could go between MvC2 and SvC, and it worked for a couple of weeks. But then we got tired of the shittyness of SvC and MvC2 never worked, so we gave up and stopped going. That was well over a year ago.

The only way that What’s Your Game is going to get stuff going again, is to get one or more QUALITY MvC2 cabs in there. Once you have that, and you’re making steady weekend income on them, and you KEEP THE CONTROLS WORKING, we can branch out and have events like the $5 console casuals, weekend tournaments, etc. But without having that MvC2 staple present, I really doubt anybody is going to show up for anything.

Oh yeah, and Guilty Gear IS gay. A bunch of half-naked men running around in Cosplay outfits fighting in retarded fashion, and anime fanboys like it because of the Japanese-animation style, and not for the gameplay. Pretty gay if you ask me. Besides, it’s just a beefed up version of MvC1 with too many moves.

&& UNSURE
You have to understand that when I make comments, I’m not talking about EVERY SINGLE player in the Guilty Gear community. People always take it like that.

Perfect case in point: after all the drama with the James Austin thing, and after I was forced to ban him from ECC for his own good, I have had nothing but grief from Guilty Gear players.

Just today, FlashMetroid posted in the ECC thread: “Is there still a Guilty Gear tournament at ECC? People on the guilty gear message boards are saying no.”

So now I have to go and defend ECC again saying there IS Guilty Gear. People in this community are so fucking fickle…OH MY GOD I banned James Austin because of the ridiculous things he said and then KEPT GOING on SRK, and I’m afraid if he comes to ECC somebody who doesn’t have the self control of myself or Wigfall might do something stupid. I’m not willing to put that kind of risk out there because it could potentially RUIN ECC and its reputation.

But stupid, favortistic assholes in the Guilty Gear community are out to destroy ECC. WHY? I have no fucking idea. Probably because they’re total morons and they want to bone Jamie or something. I was banned from the Guilty Gear websites so I can’t even track down what these idiots are saying about ECC and defend the tournament.

So please, DON’T come to me saying that all Guilty Gear players are innocent, normal people. They are not. I know there are NORMAL players out there, but the fact of the matter it, it is the ridiculous freaks and assholes that seem to always take the forefront in the Guilty Gear community, and you may want to think about that and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

Honestly the GG players I know really are perfectly innocent, normal people. Sure, they didn’t like your attitude towards at the start (hence the reason there’s a tournament in Ohio) but plenty are still coming to ECC regardless of that.

Thank you for making this post, it’s good to know that the majority of Guilty Gear players are not what they make themselves out to be online. It’s also very good to hear that a lot of people are looking to go to Ohio and then come to ECC the next day, now THATS dedication. It’s very disheartening to hear from multiple sources that people are talking trash about a major tournament because of what happened with ONE out of line player.

We’re rich bitch!

Spoken like a true retard.

I get what you’re saying, you want ST, CvS2 and MvC2 comp. You just said it in the most retarded way that, if I didn’t think you were kidding, I might get mad. It’s bad enough I’ll own you in all three of those games, but then you go off on a rant about how you’re the biggest group of players and you keep CT alive and some shit. Sorry, but when was the last time we saw Danbury crew place in any tournament EVER? :wonder:

If you want to come down and get owned, let’s get some money matches going. I’ll play anybody in Danbury in any Capcom fighter for money. Put your money where your mouth is!

Oh come on.

Tony and I have gone back and forth in Marvel for ages. To say that he’s the best is pretty ridiculous.

We never had the “final big CT tourney” that I proposed a few years back. Maybe I’ll have to think something up. But there definitely hasn’t been anything determined in Marvel in CT for a long ass time now.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-ct-thread/1844/3520
>    Deciding who is better tony or phil?, thats like trying to decide who I like better, my Mom or Dad

I had BETTER be the dad in that analogy…

If people are so sure of themselves, why not have a little contest?

Me vs Tony in MvC2, title of CT’s best in marvel?

You can place your bets accordingly, hell we can even determine real odds. I’m sure I’ll find people to either back me or I’ll back myself depending on the amount, so it’s all good.

Any takers?

Rob, long time no talk man. This is Phil.

I’m running a console tournament at web2zone (its a really big lan center in the city) on April 28th. There’s going to be MvC2 as well as pretty much every other fighter you can think of. The thread is here: http://forums.shoryuken.com/showthread.php?t=126965 so check it out, it would be cool to have you come by.

Also I don’t know if you heard, but EVO is having another qualifier in Connecticut on Memorial Day weekend. it’s taking the place of ECC…this is the first year that there will be no ECC so this tournament is taking its place. You can check that out here: http://forums.shoryuken.com/showthread.php?t=127989

Good to see you man, hopefully we’ll get to play sometime.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-ct-thread/1844/3928
Your first post said “Roberto Aponte” and I only know one person from CT who got 2nd in MvC1 at ECC…haha.

I still live in Bridgeport. I moved to New Haven for a while but then I got a new job down here so I moved back.

You’re right, I am a pretty busy guy. Weekdays are 100% out due to work and working out and other stuff. The only time I play is usually on weekends, and usually it’s not in CT. Since last EVO, this past year has been crazy busy with tournaments and stuff. Just for example, this weekend is an event at TGA in Massachusetts, then on the 28th I’m running the Web2Zone event, ECC next month etc. Lots of places to go if you are looking for comp.

Chinatown fair is OKAY. Not great anymore. They haven’t fixed the controls there in ages. Everything works but it’s all worn out. They still have buttons on the Capcom vs. SNK 2 machine that have been there since the day the game came out…in 2001. So that should give you an idea of why I don’t think very highly of Chinatown anymore. However there are still lots of locals that go there. It’s just not very hype like it used to be back in the day.

Honestly the only active Marvel players in CT right now are myself and Tony B. Tony lives up in Preston but he usually comes out for the tournaments (he’ll be at TGA and web2zone). Besides that pretty much EVERYONE has “retired” which basically means they got women who have them pussywhipped and tell them they can’t play games anymore. Which I find hilarious :rofl: but what can you do.

My MAJOR game right now is Super Street Fighter II Turbo. I got 5th place at EVO in 2005, won the EVO East qualifier last year and got 9th at Worlds. I do still play Marvel but I haven’t really played it at all until very recently. At EVO in Vegas this year I have a $500 marvel money match lined up, so I have to start playing that game again so I don’t choke. I also play Capcom vs SNK2 and SF3: Third Strike, but I’m nowhere near as good in those games.

Anyway yeah Rob it’s great to see you on SRK. Pretty much for the past couple of years CT has been almost totally dead Street Fighter-wise and I’ve had to start travelling like crazy to get competition. Maybe on an off weekend when there’s no tournaments going on we can get some Marvel players together.

I also heard that Shoebert is going to have a MvC2 party/tournament this summer, I guess we’ll have to wait and see, would be fun to beat up on all the “old timers” haha.

you notice that Walter (bacardi) has not addressed one thing i said on here?

or apologized to me at all?

in fact he’s barely spoken to me this week…

HHHHMMMMM

>    been working till late this whole week, and I addressed bobby and sbw in pm hmmmmmm, btw I just reread your post I like that part where you say you tried to get in contact with me, yet didnt call me once

why would i call you, when you already made plans, posted about them publicly, and i had no car? you said you would call me when you were getting ready to go (said you were getting a cab and I thought that was insane). let’s get serious here, you fucked up and you’re unable to admit a mistake. you blew me and aponte off to sit around the house, watching TV and smoking weed all day. am i right, or am i wrong?

last time i checked, when you make plans with someone and something changes, YOU should be the one to call. not the person stuck at home with no car, sitting around all day. you need to learn to man up.

July 14 is the date of the next Web2zone event i’m running in NYC. Would probably be a bad idea to have something then.

dood i retired at least like 2 more times after that…but this year i might retire after evo world for real…!!!

Rob i agree, we should have the “world championships of mvc1” every year at evo east considering that shit is in CT…hopefully some people would show up then. actually black rich and his cousin and andrew jin did show up, but besides that none of the other horsemen did.

Rob you should definitely come to web2zone and bring as many people as you can, most of the event is casuals anyway, i’ve gotten the tournament part of it down to an art so everyone gets to play as many casuals as they want. it’s a fun time.
