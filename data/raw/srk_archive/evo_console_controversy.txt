I’m going to be succint, and to the point, and end ALL of this discussion about console vs arcade cab, SRK vs the players, good vs evil, blah blah blah. This post will solve the entire issue…and still manage to be long.

The Real Issue: What is EVO?

If EVO is indeed a convention-like event where the majority of players are coming to have a lot of casual games, meet other players, and hang out, then console is the obvious correct choice. It saves time, money, and provides the opportunity for a lot of casual play, filling in those awkward spaces of “having nothing to do” between tournament matches. Since the numbers attending EVO have grown, and the crowd going to EVO is ever-changing, it appears that this may be the correct assumption.

But, if EVO is indeed the biggest, best, most serious Street Fighter tournament in the United States (and in the case of MvC2, the ENTIRE WORLD), then arcade cabinets are the correct choice. The top-players of ALL Street Fighter games are accustomed to this venue, this style of control as well as these versions of the games. Having an all-arcade tournament caters to these top players…the players that pretty much created the Street Fighter community, popularized it, and turned it into what it is today. The players that were around before the era of multiple thousand-dollar first prizes and thousands of attendees.

So that’s the issue: What is EVO? Has it grown into a convention where thousands of fighting gamers can get together and have fun, and a lot of casual play? Or is EVO the biggest, best, most serious and meaningful tournament EVER?

The PROBLEM is this:

Everyone seems to think to call EVO one thing, you have to sacrifice the other. It CAN’T be a convention and a serious tournament all at the same time…this is the general consensus, it seems.

Why is this?

The Cannons have told us that…NO MATTER WHAT…Evo will be console this year. Because it’s for the best interest of EVO and the players attending.

The Cannons are right. Making EVO console will help it to grow, and give the majority of players something to do instead of standing around during tournament matches.

But let’s say that Justin Wong, undisputed MvC2 champion, loses at EVO this year, for the first time in 4 years.

Well, because EVO is console, you have just negated the accoplishment of whoever beat Justin, and the significance of the loss. Because Justin has always been accustomed to playing, and winning, on arcade cabinets…on that specific style of control and that specific version of the game. You can attempt to emulate it by sticking velcro to his joystick…you can try to slow down the speed of the game by giving him downers and getting him drunk…but the fact of the matter is, no matter WHAT you do, Justin did NOT just lose his MvC2 crown. All he lost was a tournament in a slightly different game, from the one he rules in.

What you’ve done, by going to console, is made several thousand new players happy, but made the few hundred top-players who have stuck with the SF community through thick-and-thin VERY VERY unhappy. Because you’ve just destroyed the legitimacy of ALL of their tournaments, at the event that USED to be the most meaningful tournament of all.

Why do players like Seth, Chris Li, and others come out to SUPPORT console, despite the fact that the legitimacy of tournament play is degenerated? My guess would be that the games they were top-players in…Super Turbo and such…are no longer the top-played games at tournaments anymore. YES there are significant differences in the DC and arcade versions of ST, even MORE SO than MvC2 in some cases…but these guys have played so long that it doesn’t matter. I don’t think anybody is really going to put up a stink if Cole doesn’t win ST at EVO this year, because the game is old. HELL, the SRK staff have been trying to GET RID of ST from the EVO lineup for years now. These OG players support console because, despite the fact that the game they ruled in is now old and losing interest, they want to see thousands of gamers come together and have a good time. If EVO is purely arcade-cabinet, this is not going to happen…all you’re going to have is a mass boredom and a bunch of happy top-players.

But CvS2, MvC2…these games are still HOT. They are the two major games that SF players are coming to EVO to play, the REASON that most top players are coming. To destroy the legitimacy of the tourney play in these games is basically to say that the tournaments at EVO don’t matter, and are only a side-attraction to the convention that EVO has become.

So we have the issue, and the problem. What is the solution?

It’s pretty simple actually.

The Cannons have rented out two rooms at Cal Poly this year. Twice the space, GREAT idea.

One room should be totally for casual play. Unless you’re playing in tournament, on deck to play, or have a vested interest in what’s going on during a match (your teammate is playing, etc.), then you’ll be in the casual play room. This room is strictly bring-your-own-console (and/or stick) to play casual play games, chill out, hang out, have fun and act stupid. Kill time between your tourney matches. Eat a big messy grinder over somebody’s head and spill saunce on their back, whatever. Have a vid feed into this room from the tourney room, so if anywhere before the top 16 or 8 players there is a great match (like Justin vs Soo), EVERYBODY can see the match. This way, there is no RUSH FOR THE TOURNEY ROOM when a top match takes place.

Then there is the tourney-only room. The games are on arcade cabs, for the games that need to be: CvS2, MvC2, ST, 3s. If a game like Tekken is more commonly accepted on PS2 than on arcade, then that version is used; if not, arcade is used. Nobody can complain that matches mean nothing, nobody can complain that it’s a different version of the game than that they’re accustomed to; EVERYBODY is playing the most popular, well-accepted versions of their respective games. ALL serious tournament players are happy.

And, coincidentally, ALL casual-play players are happy.

The one forseeable problem with this perfect solution?

Money, and availability of cabinets.

But guess what?

The SRK staff have dug their own graves with this one. There is nobody to blame but themselves.

In all the efforts to “evolve” the Street Fighter community, to make it larger, more widespread, more accepted, EVO has become huge. There are so many players that qualifying rounds take too long, and there is nothing to do between matches. In the old days of a few hundred players, this was not a problem; but with the possibility of 1000+ players attending EVO, this is a DEFINITE problem that will occur.

But this is the problem that comes with growth.

Do PC game tournaments have one large-scale event, with all qualifiers, finals, and casual play all held at the same time?

HELL NO. They understand the money/time/availability constraints that come into play with tournaments.

But the organizers of EVO have not had the foresight to predict the problems that were inevitable when a tournament grows to the extent that EVO has. And now, EVO is put into the situation where either one side or the other gets screwed…either the majority of casual, normal players get screwed by being bored all weekend with nothing to do, or the top-players get screwed by being forced to make compromises on controls and versions of games they’re not accustomed to. If you were a pro baseball player, and suddently you had to play with a whiffle ball bat, and the rules of the game were SLIGHTLY changed…so much so that you weren’t even sure what the difference was until you were tagged OUT and the game was over…how would you feel?

On the flipside, if you were a ballplayer, but you were only allowed to play one baseball game every 6 months, how would you feel THEN? Both situations suck.

What can be done?

The only thing that us, the common players, can do, is voice to the SRK staff that doing EITHER of these choices in unacceptable. It is absolutely unfair to demand EITHER a totally-console or totally-arcade cabinet tournament, because EVO has grown too large for either of these alternatives.

But rather than just voice our opinions, let’s help out too. It’s easy to just complain all day on the internet and do nothing constructive for the community. Instead of just whining and saying that the current state of EVO is unacceptable, let’s help out for once.

I propose that everyone that reads this, donates $1 to SRK.

This may be next to nothing in the long run, but at least we are ALL at least doing SOMETHING to try to help out SRK, and show that we are willing to help out to make EVO the best tournament EVER. And I think that EVERYONE here…even the poorest of the poor students…can afford ONE DOLLAR.

There’s nothing left to be said. To leave EVO as it is means to screw over a group of players, and that is unacceptable. So let’s all show that we’re willing to help SRK out of this slump of a problem by showing our support.

After all, we’re all gamers here. All we want to see is Street Fighter be as successful as possible, and have the best goddamned “event” that has ever been. So let’s fucking stop talking and DO IT!

I think what we’ve all seen from this thread, and the copy of my post in Seth’s sticky thread over in Fighting games discussion, is that

PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MONEY IF THEY CAN PLAY ON THE CONTROLS AND VERSIONS OF THE GAME THAT ARE TOURNAMENT STANDARD.

If the Cannons would have just asked for help with EVO, this would have been discovered a long time ago.

However, they didn’t. They just decided that they would make an event-changing decision without even consulting the people that “supposedly” the event is being held for.

I don’t know if either of the Cannons, or Wizard, or any of the crucial SRK staff have read this thread, or my other replies. There have been no responses, so I have no idea. But if you want EVO to be without controversy, and TRULY the best ever:

Put on the main page of the site, that if you want both consoles AND arcade at EVO, to donate a few bucks. YOU WILL MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THIS. You’ve just never asked before, only ASSUMED that nobody cares, and so you make rash decisions.

I guess I should give it all up. Actually caring about the community and the quality of tournaments, instead of the quantity of players, is a lost cause. Especially when the people who have the money and power to run a large-scale tourney like EVO are so closed-minded.

SRK has let themselves blow up their own heads, and egos. I guess that they think having EVO with 1000+ random people who don’t really care and 100 good players who do care and are unhappy, is a good event. In my opinion, it’s not. And I’ve been around since the days of World Warrior, and have seen every kind of tourney imaginable.

I tried to discuss things civilly with both Chris Li and Inkblot last night. Chris Li apparently got angry that I wanted to have a conversation or something, or else has never had a legitimate conversation over a chat program…because for whatever reason he got mad that I wanted to talk and reply to his points, and signed off. Inkblot decided to stuff cotton balls in his ears and say “I’ve said everything I have to say on SRK.”

These are the people we want running the largest tournament, that represents our entire SF community?

Do we want a community where the voices of the top-players…most of which have come out AGAINST the 100% console idea, except those affiliated with SRK to begin with…are totally ignored? Not even addressed? Yeah, I’m sure the 1 minute “velcro stick” video is going to assuade all my fears about the differences between DC and arcade versions of games, stolen sticks, malfunctioning sticks, and a host of other problems that nobody seems to want to talk about.

Give me a break. People said that my “DEVO” video from last year was going to divide the community. But if you REALLY want to divide the community, just ignore the opinions of the players who’s voices should matter the most. Now you have the allegiance of 1000 new players and zero top-players. Have fun with YOUR SRK community.

But don’t even try to call it Street Fighter.

I’m not even going to argue about this, because it’s pretty obvious you don’t usually have long discussions on IRC, Chris. We should have just talked in a private message so that it was between you and me.

Half the stuff I was saying was in response to the other idiots in the room, who wouldn’t shut up. On top of that, when I type on IRC, I type in single lines, not huge paragraphs. So I agree that it’s hard to tell when somebody is done talking or going to keep going.

But that’s why it’s IRC. You can both spam lines all over and just read them, because they’re all there in front of you. It’s not like a conversation where somebody is “talking” over somebody else. You can easily scroll up and read what everybody had to say.

I apologize for any misunderstanding, I wasn’t trying to insult you or cut off any idea of yours. I just asked if I could reply to something you said, you got pissed, and left. I don’t know why. But you and I have always been cool, even if we didn’t see eye to eye, and I want it to stay that way.

Oh, and by the way, I think that somebody from SRK DOES need to get involved in an intelligent discussion (or argument? same difference) about this console issue. All the SRK staff seems to want to say when they go on IRC is “people are STILL talking about this?” as if the console @ EVO issue isn’t important.

On that note, I have to post something nasty. But I’ll do it in a separate post.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/evo-console-controversy-solved/5108/23
Everyone who is trying to get on the “you should feel guilty for criticizing SRK who doesn’t have to do this, hell you wouldn’t be able to complain if it wasn’t for their forums” bandwagon can cut the metrosexual shit. NOBODY was begging the Cannons to start up the B-series of tournies, NOBODY begged them for SRK, NOBODY told them to promote themselves as the central tournament organizers for the United States. If SHGL had been on the East Coast, it would be EVO at the Break, not in Cali, and nobody would give a shit about the Cannons or SRK.

But that’s the way it turned out. The Cannons have thrown their money around and with it have bought themselves the #1 US Street Fighter major. Only this year, they decided to change it, and turn it into a console casual play event.

Why not just cancel the fucking tournaments? That way you can have all the casual play you want. And no top players will come, because none of them will give a shit. We never came to tournies to fuck around with people; I’m sorry, but some Street Fighter players are the most nerdy, geeky, annoying, smelly, disgusting fucks on the planet. We just came to compete and make money, and have some good matches and some fun in the process.

But I guess that true feeling of real competition got lost somewhere, and got replaced with that desire to have your asses kissed by a million people who don’t even know what Street Fighter is really about. That was proven when you decided to bring in non-serious fighting games like Smash Brothers. Give me a fucking break.

Have fun destroying your major tournament. There are things in the works that are going to blow SRK and EVO away anyway. The Cannons have been at the top of the US tournament scene for too long, and this is why they feel they can shit in the faces of the top players and get away with it. Because they’ll come anyway by the chance to win a shitload of money from a billion scrubs.

But there are groups like Empire Arcadia, Top-Haters, and others who are breaking out and making a statement. There are other intelligent tournament organizers BESIDES the SRK staff that can put together a legitimate large-scale event. It’s just a matter of time until EVOLUTION passes YOU by.

And what are you going to do then?

Just curious, what is street fighter really about that the rest of us who are alright with a console tournament not understanding? To me it seems like you’re all bitching about playing on a 6 foot box. Blah blah…to be perfectly honest, I’d rather play a bunch of scrubs who didn’t have sticks jammed all the way up their asses than play with a bunch of stuck up elitist whiny pricks. You guys are top whiners, not top players. If you’re so awesome, beat everyone despite the SLIGHTLY uncomfortable conditions instead of giving up because you can’t hold your elite arm in the exact correct position and one small game mechanic is different. You can stay home and complain about how horrible playing a console version game is and how everything is destroyed because of it while I have fun at EVO instead of wasting an eternity to play a single match.

Give it up and accept it. SRK isn’t ignoring the players, they are DOING something that they truly believe will benefit the MAJORITY of people going instead of just kissing the asses of a handful of the top players who can’t handle the switch. If only the absolute best are accepted to tournaments, you guys would A. Never make any money which makes it more interesting since so much is riding on it, and B. Nobody new would ever come around. You expect them to IGNORE the masses of people in favor of a couple of people who choose to IGNORE what playing console fixes and spend extra money just so you can play a little more comfortable and waste hundreds of other people’s time in doing so? Pretty damn selfish if you ask me.

I’d love to see a poll run in here. “Are you going to EVO?” “A. Yes, I don’t care that it’s console.” “B. I’m a little disappointed that it’s console, but I’m still going because it will be fun.” “C. I’m a little disappointed that it’s on console, but I want the money!” “D. I’m not going because it was switched to console.” “E. I can’t go because of money/misc issues.” “F. I would go if they made MvC2 Arcade/Superguns.” The results would be interesting so we had real numbers for at least people who came to the forums.

The people running this do this because they love the scene, and they need to accomodate everyone. Just because you are good at a video game doesn’t mean shit. Your 30$ entry is just as much as everyone elses, and everyone else has to deal with the conditions. Honestly, don’t come, and good riddance. Run your own tournament where only “top” players can come, and enjoy it. Create a huge hole in your pocket by trying to run a large scale arcade tourney, and actually convince people to come worldwide for it. Good luck, since it’s so easy and you’re so utterly dissatisfied with this one, create your own.

Everyone likes arcades better, but people can play for MUCH cheaper on consoles, and it’s a more viable available option. It’s honestly not too much to ask to adapt…If they switched MvC2 to superguns then there would be no more complaints except people who honestly can’t handle playing on a TV instead of a TV inside of a tall box. The gameplay change issues in MvC2 are very minor. It’s not about Arcades in my opinion, it’s about being a true fan of the game you play. I love arcades as much as the next guy, but they’re dying. They are gonna totally die off soon unless some huge boom of gamers comes along to infest them, and holding a console tourney doesn’t affect it one bit.

Whew. Lastly, I honestly think you guys are being too picky, and that’s the truth. Just go and have fun, THAT’S what it’s about. At least for me it is.

It’s pretty sad that, as usual, suggestions to try to help the Cannons with getting an arcade-like setup have gone unheeded.

Someone suggested that, to preserve the integrity of the arcade-versions of games like MvC2 and CvS2, we go along with the console stick part, but hook arcade naomi boards up to a supergun. But this was shot down within 10 seconds, with the reply that naomis work “weird” with superguns, and need two power sources or more to work, and even then they’re still buggy.

It looks like no matter what we do, this will be a console-only tournament. The pleas of the top-players in the CURRENT Capcom fighters will go unheeded.

There is nothing at all wrong with a console tournament. The problem is that EVO is being billed as the US Fighting Game Championships, and it’s NOT that. It’s just the largest console fighter tournament in the country, with a convention-like atmosphere. It’s not serious competitive play for the ARCADE versions of these games.

So, if you play arcade and you’re looking for one central US national to go to…I suggest ECC (Seattle and many WC players will be attending this year) or MWC (which always has a decent turnout and HUGE comp for CvS2). If you just want to have some fun and hang out with players, go to EVO.

But don’t even try to say that EVO is “the Big One” because SRK just knocked that tournament OFF the top of the food chain. I would call that De-volution rather than Evolution.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/evo-console-controversy-solved/5108/45
Inkblot deleted his “inspirational reply” because it probably held no validity. Just like the rest of the nonexistent replies to my comments.

If Street Fighter dies, it’s going to be from lack of new games, not by arcades dying. Moving to consoles isn’t doing shit to “save SF” so get off your high horse. The problem here is that you have this idea in your head that SRK has been “saving SF” for years. It was always the players coming out that kept SF alive. You guys helped and did a lot to contribute to the community…but don’t act like the decisions you make are going to determine the fate of the entire community. Only the community can determine its own future.

Nobody is going to want to play MvC2 in ten years. Nobody will be playing SF at all if there are no new games at all, arcade or console. ST may be the exception, but let’s face it, a handful of old men getting together once a year is not going to be considered “keeping SF alive.”

If new games are released (on console no doubt) then the community will survive. The games will be played on console FROM THE START so no discrepancies between arcade and console versions will exist. Therefore, people will play on console from day 1 and have no argument against it.

My argument against console has always been that the arcade version, which has been tournament standard for 4+ years, is not being used for the biggest tournament in the country (and in the WORLD for MvC2). Controls have never been an issue; anyone can adapt to a console stick (if its held down somehow) so its not a valid argument. It’s the differences between arcade and console versions that are sucking it up, and the compromise that is being forced down our throats isn’t acceptable. For future games, this problem will not exist, but for games that have ALWAYS been played on arcade as the tourney standard, it just doesn’t make sense.

The fact that some of the best players EVER in MvC2 are planning to NOT ATTEND the biggest tournament for that game IN THE WORLD should tip someone off. But I guess it doesn’t matter, because an “OG player” who SRK is friendly with didn’t say anything, and nobody is complaining about ST.

But I’m sure that if there was an outcry by Chris Li, Tragic, Seth, Valle, Choi, and other “friends of SRK” that AE should be played at EVO instead of ST, it would be there. Right? But the fact that no “friends of SRK” play MvC2 pretty much spells out the fact of how biased this is.

If anything is going to “kill SF” it’s going to be the rifts you’re creating in the community, and the lack of new Capcom games. NOT the fact that arcades are dying. SF players will always find a place to play THE FAVORITE VERSIONS OF THEIR GAMES whether or not it’s in an arcade or not.

But forcing a change and shoving it down the top players’ throats in the most popular fighting game EVER in the US, WITHOUT convincing them it’s for the best, is just suicide for all of us.

A lot of points, some more valid than others.

Why is 3s on supergun? In all honesty I have no idea. The same line of thinking that SRK is using with 3s apparently doesn’t apply to MvC2.

3s is on supergun because of some minor differences in the DC and arcade versions. Notably, some character lose combos/infinites (Urien) and some lose some links (Ken’s crouching medium punch into kick super). It’s nothing game-ruining or unacceptable (considering the fact that no US players are good enough to use Urien at a Jap-level anyway) so the demand for supergun doesn’t make sense. Keep in mind that SRK chose to have 3s on supergun THEMSELVES without consulting anyone, and gave no real reason for this selection besides the above mentioned reasons.

Now, look at MvC2. It’s in exactly the same boat as 3s. Instead of having infinites missing, we have considerable game speed changes. Since MvC2 is arguably the fastest-paced fighting game ever, you would think that speed would be a factor. You also have significant chip damage differences (Doom’s rocks, Cable’s AHVB and other things do more) and regular damage differences (AHVBs do 10% more damage when they hit). On top of all this, some of the lesser-used characters such as Anakaris, who have touch-of-death strats that can destroy entire teams, do not work on the DC.

So, the question is, why does 3s get this special treatment, but MvC2 is overlooked? There’s no logical explanation besides the fact that SRK staff do not properly understand the extent of changes beteween the arcade and console versions of the game…but for some reason, they understand the changes in 3s. I talked to some of the “friends of SRK” on IRC about this, including Seth and Sabre, and the only answers they had to give me were “whatever” and “who cares.” Well, I CARE, and so do the rest of the better players.

In my opinion, the changes in MvC2 are WORSE than the ones in 3s. This is favortism at its worst.

FMJ argues that catering to the top players only hurts the community. Well, you’re right, you shouldn’t ever cater to a small group of people. But YOU, THE SRK STAFF, have been the ones who decided that the arcade version of MvC2 would be tourney standard by having that version for years at your own major tournies. Now you’re going to switch it for MvC2, screwing over that group of top players, while you keep supergun 3s for the same reasons that MvC2 players are complaining. There is no rationality behind this, besides favortism.

As for your comment about “sane people” knowing that eventually SF would go to console, it depends on what you mean. Yes, all of us expect to see fighting video games go solely to console eventually…but we’re talking NEW games that come out. If a game has been played on an arcade version for years, and that is the tourney-accepted standard, it doesn’t make sense to switch to console. But if a game is console-only or if the console version IS the accepted tournament standard, then there would be no problem. But to force people to play a different version of the game at the biggest tournament IN THE WORLD for that game, because you want to “save time” and “have casual play” is just assinine.

If you’re going to complain about A3, get the facts straight. Yes, no accurate console version was ever ported, but you forget the fact that when the game was in arcades, it NEVER got the attention that MvC2 has gotten. It’s a straight up fighter with bad hit boxes, that didn’t have the widespread appeal that MvC2 does. I agree that some of the support from console versions that MvC2 has gotten was never available for A3, but when you compare the popularity of the two games, you can’t deny that MvC2 was just more popular in arcades anyway. Besides, just TRY finding a LEGAL copy of MvC2 anywhere…you can’t. And the majority of average gamers have no idea where to get an illegally ripped .iso to burn the game. Yet MvC2 is still the most popular fighting arcade game to date. Go figure.

I guess you also didn’t read my full post, or any of the threads I’ve replied to, since you claim that I haven’t given any kind of viable plan to get enough cabinets to EVO2k4. More than enough people have stepped up and straight out said they’d donate a decent amount of money…the most I’ve heard is $100…if it would help out to get some arcade machines there. A bunch of people have bought premium memberships simply because of my posts. Two people have said they would BUY cabinets if SRK would have the boards to put into them.

The problem here is not money; its not transportation or the availability of cabs or the unwillingness of people to help out and participate. The problem is that SRK has given us the “brick wall” signal and simply wants to do it their way. They have thrown every excuse in the book at us to say that cabs are not needed…from money, to velcroed sticks, to availability of cabs, to “who cares, console versions are close enough”…and showed no willingness whatsoever to openly discuss any of the issues. Any legitimate argument is either ignored or hated on by some huge post that raises valid points that have NOTHING to do with the argument at hand.

If anyone from SRK, including the Cannons, Wizard, Tragic, Seth, or anyone wants to get on here and start a VALID discussion of why such changes are taking place…without hate, making fun, calling people “whiny scrubs” or “elitists,” then that would be acceptable. At least TRY to convince the community that this change is beneficial.

But being favortistic to the 3s players while the players of the tourney with the highest tournout are ignored…doesn’t make any fucking sense.

I’m not trying to just “keep this thread going.” I let it be for like a week, and then Inkblot replied with some bs, so I had to reply. Then you kept it going by replying.

In the long run, console isn’t that big of a deal. I agree 100% control-wise because it’s easier to just get used to a stick and play on that at EVO than to be surprised by some wacky loose/tight 360 that doesn’t respond like your own. I also agree that new fighting games will be played on console 100%, because arcades are slowly but surely disappearing.

I just feel that forcing the best players in the world to play on a format they’re not familiar on is unfair. That’s all. I always speak up when I feel something is unjust, and I take a lot of heat for it. It’s not like I expect to place at EVO, I just know that a few of the top-players are seriously considering not going (names you would be VERY surprised to hear) because of the console situation.

Casual-play wise console makes sense. But in a competitive tourney atmosphere for a game thats been on arcade forever, it doesn’t. I’m sorry but the hundreds of players who will “benefit from being able to play on console because they don’t have any local arcades to play at” are NOT GOING TO PLACE AT EVO. It’s going to be the same players who have been at the top and who we all expect to be there. You’re not going to see Joe Scrub get third place because, all of a sudden, he was allowed to play on a d-pad instead of an arcade cab. So the switch to console has NO POSITIVE ASPECTS WHATSOEVER besides not having to physically bring boards/cabs there, and possibly saving an hour or two.

But all the probs with sticks, handicaps being switched, DCs and other things frying out, controversy with pause button/analog button presses, etc., is going to take JUST AS LONG as if they had played the entire tourney on console all along. Even TRAGIC did an accidental pause last year, and if that happens in a heated match at EVO, I’m going to call for a disqualification no matter what.

There’s going to be a lot of bitching, a lot of trouble with sticks, a lot of issues, and no saving of time at all. But rather than discuss the issues, those in charge of EVO have decided to stick cotton balls in their ears. They’ll be sorry.
