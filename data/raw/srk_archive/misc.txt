Decent turnout, 21 players plus one super-late entry (Rob Aponte). This tournament featured buy-backs for players who lost before the next to last round of losers, they were stuck into a buy-in bracket and had a play off to see who would get back into the real tournament again. Here are the results:

1. Desmond “Xecutioner” Pinkney
2. Phil “DSP” Burnell
3. Shoe, the old-school MvC1 player who amazingly comes back and whups everybody’s ass
4. Cuong “Kong” Nguyen, who called out of work from Officemax to play
5. Rob Constant and Dru “Liquidswords” Atanacio
6. Josh “A Minor Threat” Jodoin and James “AmakusaYoshiroTokisadaYaddaYaddaYadda” Austin
7. Chris “I’m in the Empire!” Ellis, Jason Kasprzyk, Walter “BacardiJ3di” Padilla, “Black” Rich Williams, and Christian
8. Jeff “GohanFan” Cibulus, Jermaine Jenkins, and Phong “Speedy” Nguyen
9. Tristan Levy, Rohan, Oliver Chang, Fred, and Chris S.

The winners of the buy-back-in brackets were Chris Ellis and Speedy, but they lost to Kong and Shoe, respectively. Chris Ellis lost to Kong TWICE in this tournament, but only because he bought back in. Shoe lost to DSP twice because it was losers’ finals.

Comments:

-Walter “BacardiJ3di” Padilla tried to pull a fast one by LYING and saying he beat Christian, when they never even played. This totally fucked up the brackets and I had to stick Christian into a later buy-back round because Walter had lied, and already got eliminated from the tourney before I could fix anything.
-Shoe came out of NOWHERE and decided to kick everybody’s ass today. The guy doesn’t even play MvC2 but you may remember him from MvC1 days.
-Kong, for the first time ever, decided to do well in a tournament and got 4th. He was going to go to work but decided to call out and stay, and he did well. By the way Kong, you left your pizza so Shoe and I ate it :smiley: can’t let it go to waste.
-Winners finals was DSP vs Desmond, which Des won 3-1. Finals was a repeat, 4-1. Pretty much I couldn’t block anything Des’s Magneto did on our sticks, which is funny because I could block everything Sanford did with Magneto at CTF a few weeks ago. Either our cabs controls are too close to each other so I can’t get the correct angle to block fast, or the sticks aren’t as good as CTF’s. But I’m sure as hell that I knew how to block that basic high-low stuff he was doing.
-Dru just doesn’t understand the fact that you can’t buy back in if you’re in 5th place when you lose; that’s just too far. He kept complaining that I wouldn’t make an exception for him, when I kept explaining to him that everyone else that re-entered lost two rounds before him, and would most likely easily lose to Shoe and Kong anyway. He was upset, but oh well, I’m a FAIR tournament director and I can’t make exceptions.

There will be another tournament in THREE weeks time on August 16th, that’s the Saturday after EVO.

now Justin, it’s not nice to call Team Florida “trash.” They are certainly not trash.

They’re more like the recycling bin next to your trash. Maybe if we melted them down, we could use the leftovers to recreate newer, better gamers. :rofl:

Sorry, it was just out there and I had to take it.

Where is Vercette in all of this wagering? I bet he would play Infinite for money too.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/my-roommate-infinite-vs-team-trash-florida/27891/22
    dsp, you’re gettin a lil nutty in here, hasn’t florida taken your money every time that you’ve been dumb enough to open your mouth like this?

    i like the thread title

theres a reason i dont play shitty marvel anymore, too many scrubs mashing buttons and winning, try that in any other game and see what happens :rofl: why do you think the vast majority of marvel players dont play anything else?

also last time i played florida seriously didnt i take out their entire team in the mvc2 team tourney at final round a few years back :rofl:

well anyways its all in good fun, its too bad that WC had to come in here and ruin it, Infinite was just looking for free money :rofl::rofl::rofl::rofl:

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/my-roommate-infinite-vs-team-trash-florida/27891/42
1.ive played marvel seriously in the past so to say “those who dont play marvel dont respect it” are completely wrong.

2. skisonic first says that all the OG ST players are too old and busted to learn new shit. yet, i distinctly recall Choi, Watson, Valle, Cole, and others placing in games that aren’t ST.

3. skisonic talking shit to me again. over what? over the money match you beat me at in marvel at the random virginia tourney i went to and played you at 2am? and i told you didnt care and you demanded to play? im tired of this shit. if this is the definition of your career you really need to beat somebody else good. please tell me of 1 other good mvc2 player you’ve beaten because this shit is getting so tired. right now your claim to fame is smoking weed and fucking phae and that is not enough to make you anything more than a shitstain on the underwear of somebody notable in the street fighter community. please prove me otherwise, thanks.

4. please count the number of “notable” mvc2 players ive beaten. multiply that by 3 against the number of mvc2 players who have beaten the amount of “notable” non-mvc2 players who have lost to serious mvc2 players, besides justin and sanford (aka the only two marvel players who have proven they are greater than that shitty game). you lose.

anybody else want to fuck around?

i think that soo beats infinite, but this thread was about infinite vs florida. and i like infinite over the entire fucking state.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/my-roommate-infinite-vs-team-trash-florida/27891/35
    Come on. Don’t be stupid. Justin Wong is a Marvel player and sometimes he enters ST just for fun, and kick you out of some tourneys. He send the entire team Japan to the loser’s bracket on 2005 3rd Strike as well. Sanford is a Marvel player and is winning CvS2 and T5 DR tourneys left and right.

    So Marvel players destroy the competition pretty often when they play other things. Now when was the last time a non-Marvel player took top 5 at ECC or Evo World at MvC2?

    Never ever forever? Alright then. I guess mashing is kinda hard for most people.

who knew that the two best mvc2 players in the world represent “the vast majority of marvel players” :rofl: People can be so stupid sometimes.

And anyone taking the shittalking seriously is :looney::looney::looney::looney::looney:

PS you all suck. pz.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/my-roommate-infinite-vs-team-trash-florida/27891/59
Nah, it’s cool, we know how it goes. Justin makes a thread for which the title refers to florida as trash, but he gets no hate. I make a joke that’s not serious and I get all of it. It’s a double standard but i’m used to it. it’s not like a give a shit about anything said in this thread anyway. it’s just funny as hell to see people get baited/heated so easily.

say what you will, i don’t care. infinite is going to take all of your money anyway.

Actually, I beat you in the last CT tourney you were in, eliminated you in fact.

I’ll play you for any amount of money Steve, just bet it or shut it.

Didn’t you just say on IRC that you’re afraid to play me? That my hate is too powerful? Alrighty then, excuse boy.

Dope. So if I went, I win MvC2 for free and it’s me vs my old pal Mike Creque in ST for the title of “must obscure and underattended tournament of the new millenium ST champion.”

I’m sure FMJ is the bomb player he claims to be, with the 20 people he draws in for comp every 6 months!

But for rills, should have had this on Sunday, I would have come.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/5-20-mvc2-the-break-results/6028/9
It was great to make it to this weekly and see so many of the familiar faces. I wish I could have made it to these things more often over the past few years. It was really a learning experience. Good shit to everyone, I had a lot of good matches.

I used most of my time trying out new teams on the small cabinet against different top players, and I used the tournament itself as an outlet to try my former good teams (Santhrax and variations) to see how good they stand up against the competition today. Seems that most people have gotten used to my Santhrax. Not a good sign. Or maybe it is…

I’m very, very glad I went to this weekly, and I’m very glad I didn’t announce that CT was going to show up. I don’t really think anyone understood our reasons were for being there. But you’ll all understand next week, I think.

At ECC this year, it’s finally going to happen. There are many of those that oppose us…

…but by the end of ECC, you will learn to respect us. You’ve dug your own graves for long enough. We are finally unified, and there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop us. All of the years that we put up with disrespect, the pain of not being recognized, of choking in tournaments, has only motivated us more.

At ECC…

HATE LIVES,
EMPIRE FALLS.

What in the…

Wow, super low turnout at this tournament. Fucking ORG beating X, this is just too much. At first I thought the results were a joke but I guess not.

CT couldn’t make it. Kevin Smith, who usually drives, was whitewater rafting with his girlfriend this weekend. Kong was working and I had to write a huge fucking senior thesis paper since I’m graduating this month. I dunno about anybody else. Everyone is just busy as hell, especially me with graduation coming up.

Okay…

Maybe it’s time to give up. When you guys are letting ORG beat you, it’s a good sign to call it quits. This is the same guy I beat with Mag/BBhood/Tron on the big screen at C3 a few years back, and you’re letting yourselves get raped. Pathetic.

If this is a sign of how you’re all going to perform at ECC, or EVO, then don’t go. Seriously. Let people who want to play and win represent our coast, and save this wimpy shit at home. I’m really disappointed in you guys…I want to know who specifically lost to ORG.

As for ORG…

Good shit buddy. Obviously you’ve either improved or you took advantage of these guys being idiots. I can’t imagine how you did it, but you did it. And it’s always good to see that someone who ISN’T considered one of the best beat out all the usual, big-headed fools. I hope this wasn’t a one-time thing, because I’d sure like to see some more non-Empire members in the top 5 at ECC.

In closing:

PATHETIC!

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/break-deodorant-5-2-2004-org-comes-out-on-top/5738/16
Why are you people so fucking retarded?

ORG used to suck. Badly. He had a bigger mouth than me and I called him out. He came to CT and I rocked him in tourney, with a joke team. He never lived it down. Then he trained with CTF heads for like a year, then moved back down south and I guess played against good players.

Now, he’s apparently better. That’s what I was trying to say. Trying to joke with him about sucking years ago but giving him props for beating up on the so-called top players of the East Coast. I think it’s deserving that he’s come out of nowhere and basically whupped up the usual winners. He reminds me of me, getting hated on by everyone for years, but then coming out of nowhere and beating good people. Of course, I’ve never won a Break tourney, because I rarely go. And ORG did.

But, he didn’t beat me. So a match between us would be good IMO.

If you guys can’t get that, you have some real fucking literacy problems. Stop trying to start shit, learn how to take a joke, and shut the fuck up. I don’t see how it was anyone’s business but ORG’s anyway.

And Desmond, you’re not one to talk, at all. You basically trained the kid and now he’s beating you. Isn’t it ironic? I bet you’ll lose to Blaziniflo at ECC.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/break-deodorant-5-2-2004-org-comes-out-on-top/5738/26
&& UNSURE
This is a fucking joke, right?

Still pissed about losing that $50 when your “boy” Infinite lost 5 straight to me?

I think someone’s head has grown five sizes too large.

Is this the same Desmond who lost to Potter at EVO2k2, before he got so good?

Is this the same Desmond that lost to BRONSON, a fucking Tekken player, in a major tournament?

The same guy who’s arch nemesis is KEVIN SMITH of CT, who you seem to lose to in every tournament you face each other?

Let’s get something straight. Of all the players of CTF, you’re the most random in tourney results. One day you play awesome, next day you suck balls and lose to scrubs.

The only reason you’ve ever placed above me in tournament is 1. you go to a hell of a lot more tournies than me and 2. you play the fucking game 40 hours a week, like a full time job.

If there’s one thing I’ve noticed as of late, its a lot of disrespect among the EC players. Instead of supporting each other and playing and having fun, its all about shit talking, disrespecting others, and making fun. When I went to CTF to play Infinite, even your fucking coaching couldn’t save him. I guess you forgot that it was supposed to be Mike vs DSP, not CTF vs DSP. But you stuck your fucking nose in and then you got pissed off when you lost your money. Then I ALMOST beat you in out set even though I was tired as fuck at that point from playing something like 30 games in a row.

Do you think it was fair that you coached Mike? And you did the same at the Break during the triple threat, and he came out on top that time. Real players don’t need people whispering over their fucking shoulder what to do. That’s the ultimate sign of disrespect: everyone has to fucking team up to beat a so-called scrub from Connecticut? Give me a fucking break.

SO now you’re gonna come out and try to talk shit to me, Mr. Random? Get the fuck outta here. If you think everything I’ve said about what’s going to happen at ECC up to this point was a joke, you’d better fucking wake up. FUCK ALL OF YOU HATERS who think you can be cool by “talking shit to DSP” like its some kind of fad. You’re all nothing to me, and I’m going to turn you into nothing when I wipe the smiles off your faces at ECC. You guys really don’t understand that I’m through fucking around with you.

And Desmond, YOU had better hope that I’M not in YOUR fucking bracket. Because I’m going to send you to losers so fucking fast, you’ll be calling home to your moms with a tear in your eye about how you lost to “some random scrub” again. Cry me a river, Mr. Random, because when you piss me off, all the coaching and shittalking in the world won’t save you. HATE LIVES, EMPIRE FALLS.

Consider yourself challenged. The HATE ARMY will be glad to take your money.

I’ll have to form a team for this, but that shouldn’t be a problem.

Looks up at comments in the thread

Thinks to himself how fucked up it is that the East Coast STILL gives him no respect

I’m sorry, but I guess I’m going to have to beat all of your asses AGAIN. Maybe you all didn’t remember the first few times I kicked you all over the place.

Infinite and I are 1-1. I’ll beat him in a grudge match easy. No more fucking Cable pussy bullshit, it’s time to fucking beast his ass.

Demon Hyo? You’ve always had skills Brandon but fact of the matter is, after reading this thread, I’m pissed off. Consider yourself beasted on.

Josh Wigfall? He’s always been good and one of the most solid players there are. But I’m sorry, he fell off. If I can OCV him with team Santhrax, not even my best team anymore, that’s pretty bad.

Mixup? We’ll see at ECC.

Isaac? Very good player, awesome MSP. But he can’t beat Santhrax. He couldn’t beat MY Santhrax, and my Santhrax isn’t that good. He’s probably the best sole-MSP on the east coast, but I don’t know how he’s going to fight good Sentinel teams.

Ricky Ortiz, again, is not East Coast. Stop mentioning his name.

Rick Mears is a great player, but he chokes (lost to Pungzaa at the Break), and doesn’t travel. Scratch him off the list too.

Desmond? Undoubtedly one of the best over here. But over here, and over there, are two different stories. He never does well in Cali, and I don’t know why. I’d like to play Desmond in another set to gauge myself and see how much better I’ve gotten, but last time we played, he beat me 5-3. Pretty close.

Sanford? The man has always been a beast. YES he should be on the team, but he needs to get pumped up and have proper coaching. Without it he gets nervous and will make mistakes. He’s the next Justin IMO and he should be on the team 100%. AND I also want to play Sanford in a set…I haven’t played him in ages for more than 1 game at a time.

Justin Wong. Nuff’ said.

SO, whoever the hell on this list thinks they’re outright better than me, and deserves a spot on this fucking team over me, come and prove it. AGAIN, I’ve beaten:

-Demon Hyo
-Josh Wigfall
-Isaac
-Infinite

All convincingly before, some in tourney play. I’m really fucking insulted that my name hasn’t come up. If you’re going to disrespect me just because I don’t win tournies (because I rarely go and I don’t CARE) then come and prove you’re better than me.

FUCK man, you guys really pissed me off bad this time.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/which-players-do-you-all-think-should-be-on-team-ec-wc-in-mvc2-this-year-at-evo2k4/5208/29
The reason that the EC team lost last year is that there was no unity at all. Besides maybe Justin and Ricky it was a bunch of individuals trying to show off, and it failed miserably.

In order for the EC to win this year, the team has to be unified. EVERYBODY has to feel that everybody on the team deserves to be there and trusts the other teammates to win. They have to help each other out, pump each other up, and get psyched to beat the WC players. Remember, WC has home court advantage. And the rest of the coast has to be behind this team 100%. No more bs, just support.

I’m going to support the EC team whether or not I’m on it. That’s how we’re going to win.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/which-players-do-you-all-think-should-be-on-team-ec-wc-in-mvc2-this-year-at-evo2k4/5208/55G
Why is Rashaan talking shit to Soo???

I think both coasts need to hold some kind of a “qualifier” event. Ultimately it’s going to be up to Justin to pick the EC team this year, though. But WC has no figurehead like that who can definitively pick.

I hope WC can get their act together, because this year, I can guarantee EC is going to be SERIOUS.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/which-players-do-you-all-think-should-be-on-team-ec-wc-in-mvc2-this-year-at-evo2k4/5208/76
This is the guy who I OCVed with Tron/Magneto/Iceman at C3, the Connecticut Capcom Championships. Second largest tourney in CT history (47 players for MvC2) and I raped him on the big screen in front of everyone.

I’m going to respond to some of the ridiculous things in this thread HERE. Then I’ll post my legitimate feelings on how to improve the SBO quals over in the “Team SBO 2005” thread in tournies and events.

Comment: A lot of people from the WC have tried to defend themselves saying “HEY, it’s the WC that talks to Japan and gets the SBO stuff going! We do all the work! Who are YOU fucks to complain???”

Reply: Nobody chose to have it that way. It just turned out that way because the B-series tournies were always on the WC, as well as the SHGL tournies that used to be big. It would only make sense that the SRK staff would be the ones to talk to them, because the closest US major to Japan is in Cali.

But when you’re talking SBO, you’re talking having a team that represents the entire United States, so having the WC in charge of it 100% is NOT acceptable. It’s one thing if you’re arranging accomodations for EVO, and totally another if you need to discuss SBO arrangements with Japan for an entire nation.

BUT, Kuni is friendly with SRK staff and so he talks to them. Maybe if somebody else besides SRK stepped up to the plate and tried to stay in contact with Kuni, we could get something else going. Jason Wilson has already expressed this interest.

Comment: Yeah, the turnout for SBO quals was low (as little as 9 players) but the normal double elim tournies were maxed out at 32! So it wasn’t that the tourney was a failure as much as everyone was cheap and nobody wanted to fork over the $25.

Reply: Never before has such an incorrect comment been stated. The problem wasn’t the $25 entry fee, it was the fact that NO OTHER PLAYERS GOOD ENOUGH TO PLACE (or who felt they were good enough to place) WERE PRESENT. If you’re a scrub or a mid-level player, it would be fun to enter a normal tourney, but not so fun to put yourself up the elite players who are willing to pay $25 to enter. After they’re done wiping the floor with you, you’ll wonder what crack you were smoking, or how much crack you could have bought with the money you just wasted.

The problem, again, as many have stated, is that SBO quals are held on the WC. Because of bad communication with Japan, things were thrown together last minute, dates, mixed up, shit gone wrong. Ben couldn’t even be there because nothing was concrete, and then he ended up having to be somewhere else for a job. I don’t blame him. EVERYONE just needs to get their shit together.

The cost of the EC players (who could have possibly qualified) flying to Cali was not worth it. The tourney dates were uncertain, and with other things going on over here, it wasn’t worth the trip for these guys. Yeah, Justin may win every MvC2 tourney he enters, but do you think he wants to spend all that money flying to Cali 3-4 times a year? THEN having to pay to go to Japan on top of that? I don’t. It’s really easy for WC heads to take a defense that the EC hasn’t tried to organize SBO quals, but that’s just not true. We haven’t been given the chance to organize them because we’re not in contact with Kuni like SRK is. And rapidly fluctuating, uncertain dates for something you need to buy expensive plane tix for in advance is just not worth the trouble.

Comment: “If you don’t like it, you don’t have to come, and a lot of players apparently didn’t. That’s not our fault.”

Reply: Actually, it is. EVO caused a lot of controversy this year by saying that they were converting totally to console. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to come. And this is legitimate to say in this case.

Why? Because there are two or three other perfectly good major tournaments you can attend that are on console (ECC, MWC etc.). So you have other places to go if you’re so adamant about playing on a big hulking wooden cab, and the arcade versions of those particular games.

BUT FOR SBO THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. You can’t say “Fuck family fun, that shit is too far and the controls suck, I’m going to the Montgomerey, Alabama SBO quals instead!” Again, by putting all the power into the hands of the WC, you’ve destined yourselves to fail. The quals need to be nationwide so that people that can’t travel all over…or don’t like a particular arcade for whatever reason…can go where they want. If they win there, its their own fault, so they should be responsible to pay their way to the “central finals” wherever they may be.

By having the WC responsible 100% for SBO quals, you put an unfair amount of responsibility upon them. Family Fun can’t be blamed for not drawing EC players for SBO, because they didn’t choose to have a monopoly on the quals. It was placed upon them. I’m sure next year that arcade would be just as happy to have a REGIONAL qualifiers held there and not have all this drama put upon them.

Now, I have two general comments to make.

First and foremost, a lot of the players in this thread are too fucking cocky. Shittalking is cool and fun, and builds up drama and competition, yeah. But when you outright insult others it just doesn’t work. Justin is sure to start every comment about SooMighty with “I respect him as a player and a person, BUT” before he throws his wallet onto the sidewalk and states “I BET ALL MY MONEY ILL BEAT HIM AT ECC!” You gotta have respect for your fellow players before all else. If you don’t, it just gets ugly. So please, observe some caution when you post.

SECOND…

And this is the most important point I think I’ve ever made…

It DISGUSTS me to hear that players on any competitive level have thrown matches and/or forfeit and “screwed over” others. This is absolutely unacceptable and I’m very pissed off to hear about it.

It’s one thing when 1st and 2nd in a double elim tourney are really close friends, so one of them throws the match and you split the money. Nobody is screwed here besides themselves, because they denied themselves the right to have a competitive match they could have learned from.

But in a round robin, throwing matches/forfeits is just not acceptable. Trying to get your friends to qualify just proves that they couldn’t get there on their own, and they suck. Seriously.

Throwing matches in a round robin just shows that you have absolutely no respect for who is there, but instead you just want to fuck everyone else besides you and your friend. People who throw matches like this should never be able to enter competitive tournaments ever again, because it’s just not respectful and acceptable. You don’t get to be disrespectful in pro sports without getting punished, and you sure as HELL don’t get to throw tournament-level games, and it should be the same way here.

And to ANNOUNCE that you’re forfeiting and/or throwing the match is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Whoever did that should have been immediately ejected from the tourney and their place erased. I would have done it if I ran the tournament, and I’ve run my share of large tournies before and helped at ECC, so don’t try to give me your diatribe about how I know nothing of how to run shit. First and foremost always is the integrity and reliability of the tournament results, and when you’re allowing someone to throw shit like that, it just makes a mockery out of the years of hard work and practice that the players attending have put into the game.

That’s all. I hope that next years SBO quals are way better than this year was. And I hope that this year’s team does well, whether or not they deserve to be over there.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/official-grudge-match-thread/5079/18
I challenge anyone at EVO for $200. I’m not lying. ANYONE. If Justin wants to play me for $200, then so be it.

Sanford and Justin aren’t east coast, they’re empire. Having them pick the teams = the teams will be all NYC and maybe Mixup and thats it…leaving out players like Isaac, me, Shawn Morgan, Pungza, Demon Hyo, and others that always hold their shit down.

This is all going to depend on what WC players come, if enough come to form a team. It would be nice to have a 5 on 5 rematch, but it would also be nice to see some non-empire players take a crack at it.

And by the way, Top-Haters run the east coast, BIATCH!

Shut up Warlock. Incorrect assessment #5,345,027. Shadow Nigga is NOT Demon Hyo, despite all your wet dreams about him. As far as I know all of the Marvel players are cool with Baltimore Chun, so theres no reason for one of us to randomly start insulting him. It’s just some fag from Philly who is probably mad he’s not with the “in” crew so he goes from thread to thread dissing people. He randomly dissed me in another thread and I have no idea who the fuck he is, or why it was his business.

But for you to come out making wack accusations is just dumb. Brandon never “disappeared,” he’s still posting. A better question would be, why do you bother to post? You’re a nobody who just talks shit and throws bs around. Save us the trouble and chop off both your hands, so we don’t have to put up with this shit anymore.

Whoever deleted my thread is a faggot. There were some true facts in there that were confirmed. So now I have to repost in this thread.

EVO news, rumors, and events…DAY ONE

-Sanford Kelly cannot make it to EVO. He was arrested for jumping a turnstile in a NYC subway instead of paying, and was released from jail late Thursday night. He missed his flight and now has no ID or money to get on a later one. And all of the empire members are alreas in Cali.

-The US got horribly owned by the Japanese players in GGXX. Apparently the best player from the US got perfected by Daigo. In the GGXX team touranment, WC stored 22 wins while the EC only scored 3. Ouch.

-In Third Strike, K.O. from Japan was nearly unbeatable. Also, OhNuki scored 27+ wins and was still racking them up.

More info as it comes.

If you don’t trust me and my updates, and/or you deleted my threads, you are gay. That is all.

More news to come.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/evolution2k3-updates-results-upsets-etc/2084/34
This is Punish3r aka DSP.

As many of you know, I’ve been BANNED from SRK for posting updates (despite the fact that I broke the stories of Sanford not coming and GGXX results), and calling whoever deleted my threads “gay.” Anyway, as you can see I can get on whenever I want to, but I don’t see the point of signing on against the will of the people that own the website.

Therefore, if you want the latest updates, I suggest you ditch SRK and go to #capcom on EFNET of MIRC, OR you can go to Top-Haters.com where I will be updating along with #capcom the newest info available, as it happens.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/what-is-the-stick-situation-going-to-be-at-evo-360-8-way/1563/26
There are a few things you have to learn here, before you start posting.

First, don’t ever argue with, or acknowledge, anything FMJ has to say. He does not go to tournaments outside of his hometown, he has never been to a SF major, and he won’t be at EVO. He will, however, pick apart every little thing you say in order to find a mistake, then point it out to make you look stupid. Why? Because he’s a loser who sits at home all day and makes it a point to do so. Comfront him on IRC on why he’s always in channels like #capcom when he doesn’t play SF and isn’t a part of the active SF community, and he’ll get quiet really fast.

Now, theres someting else you need to know. If you talk to INTELLIGENT gamers, they will understand that switch sticks give you more accurate control, since there are actual corners on the sticks. However, for whatever reason (SHGL’s influence?) over the past 3-4 years 360s have become the standard for SF games. It’s true that for the more straight-up games like 3s, ST etc. switch sticks are probably superior, but a LOT of players have only been around since 360s have been used…to ask for a change to switch sticks for MvC2/CvS2 etc. would just be impractical and pretty stupid, since the majority of players have played these games on 360s from the start, and switch sticks would most likely just throw them off and create more complaints than positive side effects.

HOWEVER, having an option of one or the other type of stick probably makes a lot of sense. Of course, that would take a hell of a lot more organization, planning, and time to implement (what kind of sticks do you prefer for each game? etc. and then having to get that person to that type of cabinet, etc.). With the addition of FIVE new tournaments this year, I’m not seeing any time or resources available to implement anything of this magnitude.

…I just guess there are two kinds of improvement. One focuses in on the gaps and problems from past tournaments and tries to fix/improve upon them. Another focuses on throwing in new things to attract new types of players and appease new fanbases. The Cannons have opted for the second type of improvement for EVO2k3, and only time will tell if it was the correct choice.

You would think by now this guy would get the clue. The hint. The hunch. I guess not.

You can please all of the people some of the time, and you can please some of the people all of the time…but you can’t please ALL of the people ALL of the time.

At least there weren’t single game finals!

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/6-5-8otb-results-bets/1651/4
If you play in CTF, I bet you’re smelling free money right about now…

Hey ED! Find a working MvC1 somewhere, and an MvC2 that’s NOT the big cabinet at the break, and i’ll take you up on both bets! I need money bad!

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/meeting-soomighty-rowtron-and-jusin-wong/1609/15
I’ll be signing autographs for $20 for anyone who is interested.

…give me a break.

Gamers are just gamers. They are normal people. Most “top players” are really cool guys to chill with in real life. They are not cocky people who are going to brush you off like nothing if you just come up to say “wassap” and that you respect their skills. A lot of people came up to me to congratulate me for beating the Empire at ECC, and I didn’t get pissed off or act like a snob; I was actually surprised, and I thought it was pretty cool that so many people supported me. If any player does act like a dick, well, thats their loss. Let them be miserable.

But if you’re afraid to go up to a more well-known player and introduce yourself, and give them some respect, then I really feel bad for you. There doesn’t have to be an “autograph table” at EVO or any other tournament; the idea itself is absurd, because SF players aren’t celebrities, they’re just normal people. And they shouldn’t be made out to be celebrities either, because 99% of them don’t want to be. Trust me, Justin Wong does not desire hundrededs of fanboys to be all over his nuts at every tourney he goes to. But at the same time, he’s not going to mind if you say “wassap” and give him some respect. Same thing with the female players: if you want to meet them, get some balls and do it. Just don’t be some disrespectful asshole and say something stupid.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/ecc-shreks-report/1562/2
Chris Li is the man.

Now of course, when you say you withhold your judgement on the grudge match, you mean to say that we all played like shit. I almost lost because I forgot how to play for a bit, but I got my groove bad mid-set with Flash. That was a close one, lol.

Yes, Flash should have beaten me that last game when he picked Honda vs my Blanka, but he had no idea how to play that match. Which I knew, the reason why I wasn’t afraid when he picked him. Reminds me of how Julien picked Ryu vs Seth’s Honda in the finals of ST last year, but had absolutely no idea what to do, and so got crushed.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/sentinel-unblockable-banned/1481/91
Damn. So much hate, and I haven’t even posted yet.

Shady K is right, banning the Sent unblockable is like banning any other guard break or unblockable. Cable guard break is WAY WORSE than this, because you usually lose an entire character (or the game) for free. I have yet to see the Sent unblockable be abused to the extent that it wins entire games/matches, and until that happens, I see no reason to even consider banning it.

It looks like we’ve got a little rivalry between Mixup and some of you WC heads. This should be interesting…

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/ecc8-mvc2-results/1546/41
The special promotional Top-Haters copies of MvC2 were not distributed due to the creator not showing up! However, they WILL be available to the first 10 people who register for the upcoming BIG CONNECTICUT MVC2 TOURNAMENT! We now have two large-screen cabs with 360s and flat buttons. I’ll be expecting all of NYC, Jersey and Philly to show up to this, because I’m running it and you know my shit goes right. Cash prizes, perhaps some other interesting things as well. I’d also like to annouce the two grudge matches that will take place:

-Josh Wigfall vs DSP ECC8 rematch
I lost to a bunch of bullshit. Fucking low block going out costs me a match I had won. Would have changed the entire tournament. Well CT sticks are the shit so now it’s payback time!

-Ricky Ortiz vs Kevin Smith
Apparently at ECC8 there was some controversy surrounding this match, as well as a lot of shittalk from Ricky. If Ricky has the BALLS to show up, Kevin has a bone to pick with him!

Other matches to be announced. Details to go up on SRK and Top-Haters.com once finalized.

Okay, so this was shameless promotion. So sue me.


## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/ecc-st-results/1523/18
I had to play David Spence second round in ST. I have faced David Spence in every single ST tourney at a major for the past 3 years, and he has beaten me every time. Why we always end up in each other’s bracket, nobody knows. The mystery continues.

After fighting through a few scrubs I had to play Ricky Ortiz, I had a brain fart and lost to his O.Sagat. My fault. Watch me do stupid things and leave myself open to nice dizzy combos…sigh.

But I GOT PAID so I really didn’t care at that point!

Full Team ST results:

1st Team GOD Seth Killian (Balrog/M.Bison), Julian Robinson (Vega), Jason Cole (Dhalsim)
2nd Team PBS Phil Burnell “DSP” (Blanka), Bill Gould (Honda), David Spence (Dhalsim)
3rd Pete Talley (M.Bison), Kei (O.Gief), Mike Turner (New Ken)

I agree Team GOD was ridiculously overpowered. I don’t think anybody ever got past the first member who played. Jason Cole never played a game, and he got paid! Also there were NUMEROUS OCVs, meaning that only one member of a team defeated all three members of the other team in a nice run through. Members of this club: Me, Dave Spence, Seth Killian, Pete Talley? A few others. Not sure exactly who they were. But the tourney was fun as all hell, I think this format should be further explored for US tournaments.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/5-1-mvc2-at-the-break-results/1359/3
I’ve decided that from now on I will always start Mag/BBhood/Tron. Because MvC2 is a big piece of shit and it doesn’t matter.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/rules-question/1372/5
Of course that didn’t happen. I mean, MvC1 was an EXHIBITION TOURNAMENT NOT A REAL ONE so who cares right?

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/rules-question/1372/8
Too bad it wasn’t mentioned on SRK anywhere that the MvC1 EXHIBITION was going to be run by the biggest fucking moron on the planet. People flew across the country and spent hundreds of dollars to play somebody they could have driven down the street to play. But of course, that wasn’t the ONLY THING that was forgotten about when it came to the website…

But let me stop now before I hurt someone.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-break-mvc2-st-results-4-17-03/1244/4
Damn Phi got results up fast.

MvC2 controls still shitty…left stick still messed up, right side kicks still not working properly together…but I care not since I went for ST. Which I won. No show from Pete Talley, after all his trash talk. Kei showed up almost three hours late because “he was playing Quake.” …

Best highlight of the night was the ST comp, and the Hate-Cam interviews for Top-Haters.com. Expect to see those up shortly, edited of course.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-break-mvc2-st-results-4-17-03/1244/8
Bull fucking shit, I was the only one who complained. Controls weren’t unbearable, but they weren’t as good as they could have been. You shouldn’t have to mash like Sanford to get a simple fly/unfly, and Desmond shouldn’t be eating random things while he’s blocking. Any of the better players would tell you controls weren’t perfect. But since you’re just a shittalking scrub, I’m sure you don’t understand that. What place did you get???

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-break-mvc2-st-results-4-17-03/1244/11
I played with Magneto joke teams, idiot. What place did I get in ST, which I cared about?!!? Ok then, faggot.

People who try to mess with a Top-Hater get BURNT!

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/the-break-mvc2-st-results-4-17-03/1244/16
Tall scrub go to weekly. Tall scrub quiet in person. Tall scrub get owned by everyone. Tall scrub mad.

Then tall scrub come online and talk junk to established player who knows what’s what about controls, since he’s installed and fixed them himself before at his own CT tournaments. Tall scrub gets owned up by everyone online, just to add to the ownage he suffered in person.

End of story.

Hail to the king baby!

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/chaos-in-ct-results-jesters-arcade-capcom-vs-snk-2-3-28-03/1111/2
I didn’t post results because

1. CvS2 didn’t actually finish so those results aren’t correct, only speculation, and
2. MvC2 meant nothing since everybody who lost on that Agetec got robbed. We need two MAS or SAV sticks to play on that, that are equal, or else somebody always gets the advantage.

This week lets scrap A3, make CvS2 single round, and then have time for ST and GGXX.

## https://archive.supercombo.gg/t/chaos-in-ct-results-jesters-arcade-capcom-vs-snk-2-3-28-03/1111/4
Lol I don’t want to be a dick but to point out a few flaws here…

-I didn’t mean have ST and GGXX tournies, just casual play. Not enough serious players to have tourneis in those games, but casual would be fun enough. I know for a fact that a few people were waiting for the tournies to end so we could play these games, and it never happened.
-I didn’t “take” the results from anyone, they were forced on me because I posted up results from my own memory last week, and they liked how I did it. I don’t approve of posting up results of tournies that don’t finish or have blatant control problems, however, because they mean nothing.
-I don’t own a DC. I just recently got a PS2. Investing in a MAS stick is a waste of money for me. I did not plan on coming to your house to play MvC2; I thought there would be a tourney at Jesters on an arcade cabinet as always. How could I have known that I needed to bring a stick??? AHA thought so lol.
-People can’t arrive at a reasonable time when nobody knew we were going to your house in the first place. Kevin doesn’t get out of work until almost 5 and he’s our ride up there, so unless you want to have the tourney with 3-4 less players then I dunno what we can do about that.
-Nobodys gonna spank me up in anything besides GGXX, which I haven’t ever played vs. somebody who knew what they were doing, yet. Heh heh.
