<p>After 2+ years of people complaining that too much of the Week In Preview is review, and that it should be it's own video, I announced 2 weeks ago I was going to do this as an idea. Not that it would be a heavily-edited montage thing, but that it would be a quick heads-up to those who watch my content on the weekends because that's when they have the most free time. <b>If you don't know where this video came from, you must not be paying attention as it was clearly explained multiple times over the past 2 weeks.</b></p><p>Which is why it's so short (it's only meant to be a quick recap for those who have free weekends to watch YouTube content) and why it's with the handheld camera. Although I guess I could use OBS to do a screengrab, not that I think that would add anything at all to the video since it's only meant to be a very quick recap for those about to watch vids during the weekend.</p><p>Why is this on Friday? Because if you have weekends free, getting a recap of the week on Sunday is completely pointless; your weekend is already over and it's too late. This video makes complete sense from a logical perspective, and it will help cut down on time in the WIP, which will now have a VERY brief recap and be shortened.</p><p> </p><p>But thanks to the usual negative idiots above who of course have to insult and say "it's all about more views." Enjoy your warnings/moderation and hopefully you won't be around much longer since you can't help yourself but insult me nonstop.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>If using Patreon perks as a method of fundraising is "desperation" then DAMN, there are a LOT of desperate YouTubers because it's becoming MORE common for popular ones to have a successful Patreon account as a funding method than not. But they don't get shit on for it, I do. I again reiterate: was asked since 2011 why I don't accept donations, even had people ON THESE FORUMs for the past 3+ years tell me to start accepting them; now I could use the help, I do, and I get branded as "Desperate" "greedy" and the like. Repeating this kind of nonsense doesn't help, at all, and I don't get how people get hung up on it. SIX YEARS of free content, I open up donations per repeated requests, now I'm the villain? HUH?!</p><p>Chat interactivity/engagement during a playthrough RUINS the playthrough. I don't care if people on Twitch do it successfully, I've gotten tons of complaints about interacting with the chat TOO MUCH as it is now. I'm not going to further ruin the integrity of the playthrough, which thousands are watching on YouTube, because there are 60 people in stream chat. This is what people don't seem to understand: I'm a gamer FIRST, and always have been. Asking for constant interruptions in my gameplay to thank donators, interact with people in the chat etc. benefits an incredibly small group of people and makes thousands of others watching later feel disconnected. If I were still on Twitch and getting more "subs" were my business model then that would make sense, but that's not the case and it's a major reason why I left TWitch to begin with.</p><p> </p><p>Most of the "SOK" have proven on these forums to not have any genuine interest in helping me or anyone, but just the opposite. It's why they're mostly banned and more are getting themselves banned through misbehavior daily. No further mention of them need be made in this thread as it'd be considered derailing.</p><p> </p><p>That being said - the previous 2 posts really didn't help at all with the original poster's idea. Please stay on topic.</p>

<p>Too busy right now to give a full response but I'll give a few quick ones:</p><p>-100% agree that having a "vision" a.k.a. branding/gimmick could be a huge help. I USED to be known as "the average gamer that played every new game on release day and beat it faster than everyone else." Now that YouTube has changed, many bigger Let's Players are getting new games WEEKS before release and putting out their playthroughs before me, so it's no longer a valid way to describe my work. Another one used to be "the former pro SF player who rages at everyone" but let's face it, I don't play fighting games anywhere near as much as I used to, so that's not valid either. But maybe what you suggest - the fact that I upload new content ALMOST every single day (unless I'm sick or scheduled time off for Christmas etc.) - is a good selling point.</p><p>-"Throwing crap against the wall and seeing what sticks" is exactly what needs to be done right now, and is being done DIRECTLY in response to viewer request. 2014 showed me, through view performance, that JUST doing Let's Plays/Playthroughs in my classic style isn't going to cut it anymore. People want more variety - longer parts, montages that cut out filler/highlight best/worst parts of a game, and even everything I do. If I don't directly listen, try new things and see how they do, I'll never survive nor improve. I agree that doing EVERYTHING people request won't work, but right now I do need to try as much differentiation as possible to see what catches on.</p><p>-Most people who've watched my stuff for a while know that views = profit for me. Not engagement, not ad revenue, but just based on views alone. So for example, comparing the months of December (where I did pure Let's Play content and had a few days off to spend with my family for Christmas) vs. January (where I literally did half as much Let's Play content but focused on highly edited year-end series daily) I saw a 15% increase in overall views. Now it could have just been that the stuff I played in January was more popular (Kingdom Hearts 2 vs. the ongoing playthroughs of longer games in December) but I have to believe that the edited content had something big to do with that too.</p><p> </p><p>Mission statements/visions are a huge part of a successful business and I agree that I need to rebrand/redefine who I am as a gamer in order for this to keep working. I'll think about it.</p>

Pretty much since the start of his YouTube career. I understand Phil's type of humor and can see a difference between when he's enjoying himself, and when he's really bored. For those of you who watched the livestream for GoT: Episode 2 or the videos, I find it likely that you'll understand my frustration and disappointment. Phil was continually disregarding all context and the emotional impact of what was going on during the game, and was making absurd jokes almost to the point of being disrespectful. It was painfully obvious that Phil was more or less completely uninterested in what was going on. Aside from perhaps, the fight at the beginning of the episode. Almost everything that followed was a dick joke, painfully annoying musical breakouts, and just plain negligence to what was happening. For me, as a dedicated viewer (as in, I have watched nearly every video he's produced since I subscribed to his original channel) this playthrough stuck out to me, a lot. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of Game of Thrones? Perhaps. I'm not sour that he didn't enjoy the game. That's fine. What's an issue in my opinion is the lack of restraint while still trying to be entertaining. When Phil is bored, he more or less just ends up insulting/aggravating those who are fans of the game or series. It's almost as if it'd have been better for him to stop playing if he was so bored. It's possible that he was teetering on drunk, I have no idea, but if it was just boredom.. I'd have expected more self restraint. There are serious/emotional moments that are completely and utterly shat upon by him making nonsensical and (quite honestly) absurd jokes. It was just completely abnormal from the usual. It almost makes me wonder if this was fueled by the shitty/frustrating finale that DSP endured during the first stream for Dying Light. Perhaps that just set him in a foul mood?</span></span></font><br><br>Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way. Though I do know of a commentor two on the videos themselves who have expressed similar feelings. I just walked away from the stream utterly disappointed, and with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'm feeling as I do because I really look forward to his TellTale playthroughs, I dunno. I'm sure that your first conclusion is that I should have stopped watching at the point where I felt dissatisfied. That's not an illegitimate point, but I had hope that it'd get better, which it did not. I mean, I've actually managed to watch every video he's ever put ou<br><br>I'd love to hear if anyone has similar feelings. Disagreement, what have you. Any feedback is welcome, thanks.</p></blockquote></div><p>​I'll ignore the ridiculous topic derailment to give some respect to the original poster.</p><p>I'll admit, so far Game of Thrones has been pretty boring. As in, unlike other Telltale episodic games (TWD, TWAU, Tales From the Borderlands) it seems like it's just a 1-2 hour episode of Game of Thrones that you should just be watching, and not "playing" as a game. Maybe it's because they feel that's the narrative style of GOT, but if that's the case, maybe it shouldn't have been a game at all.</p><p>Episode 2 had a whopping two scenes where your input was actually needed. Almost nothing even gave a response like "they will remember that" so it really did feel like 90% filler; after the stream ended I made that comment and the stream chat responded "yeah, this is a 6-episode series so it seems like they're going to put LOTS of boring filler into it to stretch it out." And sadly that does seem like the fact of the matter: episode 2 was pretty damn boring. Keep in mind, this is coming both from a fan of GOT AND other Telltale games.</p><p>That being said: I seriously don't remember making any more/less jokes of any sort that I usually do. If somethings boring, I'll try to interject a joke here or there, sexual or no. GOT is HEAVILY into sex when it comes to the TV series/books so those kinds of jokes actually fit it well. I don't see what was expected? Me just being quiet the entire time, when literally nothing was happening to respond to? I'd have to ask if you watched me play Life Is Strange recently, because that was a playthrough I VERY MUCH ENJOYED and wasn't bored a single second of - but the game gave lots of opportunity for elaboration, jokes, getting sidetracked etc. and commentary lent itself to it very nicely. </p><p>If there's literally nothing going on in a game, it's not only going to bore me, it's going to force me to either 1. stay completely silent (and bore everyone) or 2. attempt to talk/joke etc. to try and pick things up. It's not going to work every time  and in this case, for you I guess it certainly did not. Most people watching live on the stream were in agreement that this may be a line of Telltale games that didn't need to be made; as a fan of Telltale and GOT I'm VERY much hoping that's not the case and that there's good stuff coming. But so far, I do have to agree: I'd rather read/watch this than play it/do a playthrough of it. Sorry that this PT stuck out as a stinker to you.</p>

<p>People who donated in January to my Patreon were told, in advance, that no perks would be given as they weren't set up yet, and they shouldn't expect anything out of it at all besides as a method to support me. By the end of February, goals and perks WILL be set up before the people who pledge get charged, so those people could possibly have a legit gripe if, say, I didn't come through on those goals/perks. And that's it.</p><p>Nobody, NOBODY has a legit claim to anything I do with my money, or how I spend my time. Nowhere in Patreon rules does it state "because you've donated, the receiver will now never spend money on anything, at all, because obviously they needed your money desperately to pay bills." Nor have I said I'm in awful financial straights and I desperately need tons of money to pay bills. The people saying that are those who skew my words into something that they aren't, in order to make me look bad. Goals such as "once I make $500 a month I'll buy a camera" were never set up and specifics on how donations are to be spent are not promised. So literally nobody has a legit right to complain about anything.</p><p>What I did say: since mid-2014 when I moved, there's been a legit view decline on DSPGaming and it couldn't be worse timing, because I have tons of bills built up from the move. In order to continue doing what I'm doing, I'm going to be taking several steps (including selling my statue collection) and setting up a Patreon to take care of that debt. If things go well, within 1-2 years that debt should be paid off (And hopefully I can finally sell the old condo in CT which is also a burden) and then I'll be perfectly fine.  Last time I checked, that didn't equate to me being financially destitute, nor did I ever say I was.</p><p>For YEARS people have asked me if they could donate, and I always said no. Now, since I'm at a point where popularity has declined and my debts have increased, I am accepting donations through Patreon so that I can somehow "give back" for those donations, in a way. In the future, if my popularity were to increase again OR if my debts were to be paid down, I'll probably stop accepting Patreon donations. And that will be my choice.</p><p> </p><p>In summary:</p><p>-Nobody who's become a Patreon to this point should feel disappointed as no promises have yet been made, and the situation around January was clearly explained ahead of time<br>-Future donators moving forward will receive perks/contribute towards goals and therefore will be getting what they're promised for their Patreon contributions<br>-Nobody has a right to tell me what to do with my money, regardless if you've donated or not<br>-The vast majority of people complaining are detractors/critics who 1. spread misinformation about me BEGGING for money because I'm destitute (which didn't happen) and 2. weren't going to ever donate anyway. They literally hover around me like buzzards looking for something new to peck at, instead of spending time on their own lives. They're the lowest common denominator of "internet drama queens" and only do it because it gives them attention. They need to be ignored or derided, not paid any attention to.</p><p> </p><p>And that's all. We're back, we had fun with our mini dual celebration of our 3rd anniversary-early Valentine's Day and we have no real plans for any time off again until November (not sure on that yet), when we'll be flying to the East Coast for Leanna's brother's wedding at some point.<br><br>Thanks to those who enjoyed the vlogs and tweets during our time away. And to anyone who was negative, bug off.</p>

<p><u>LONG POST INCOMING, so please take the time to read as it's a lot of info.</u></p><p>Okay, so a few things to clear up, a few things I totally agree with per the feedback in this thread, and a few additions.</p><p>Clearing things up:</p><p>1. Unfortunately <strong>setting up Patreon Perks/Goals is going to be pretty unique for me in comparison to other people</strong> who have done it successfully. Why? Because from what I've seen, a lot of the things people have set up as their perks/goals are things I already do/have been doing, FOR FREE, on a regular basis for years. A group of guys just left IGN after reaching all of their Patreon goals - the vast majority of which are things I do/have done like doing a special playthrough per ongoing requests, asking questions and getting answers, etc. Nobody is going to want to pay for something they've already gotten for free for years - so in that regard, I'm at a massive disadvantage. Did I give too much? NO, I don't believe so at all. I think it's a case of "Bigger guys" who had more viewership now finally opening the floodgates (something I did from day 1) in exchange for money. I don't have that luxury, unfortunately.</p><p>2. <strong>I cannot setup perks for advance access to anything.</strong> I unfortunately have a group of detractors (some of which you're praising in this thread, amazingly) who have publicly stated they will just share the links to whatever is given advance access to after donating $1. I hate that the selfish/malicious actions of a few affect the many, but that's just the reality of the situation and it cannot be helped. Suggesting otherwise is just wasted time.</p><p>3. I think some people have a misconception of "perks" versus "goals." <strong>Perks are something that you'd aim for with the amount of your donation </strong>(a personal thing that you earn) <strong>while goals are overall CUMULATIVE achievements via the collective contributions of the entire group</strong>. I see responses such as "nobody will donate for that" when, in reality, I'd think that probably a few goals I set up wouldn't be things that the MAJORITY of Patreon donators would be contributing for. However, setting these things as goals DOES have a positive impact on those who might want them, and literally does nothing to hurt anyone who doesn't. And the best part is, if the Patreon donator base grows naturally with time, these things can be hit, achieved and integrated into my content even if some people didn't necessarily want that specific thing.</p><p>That being said - <strong>if there is a goal that I've set that you're not particularly happy with, say to yourself "but if he hits it, does it affect me negatively in some way?" If the answer is no, then you shouldn't be negative/upset about that being a goal</strong>, regardless if you want it to happen or not.</p><p> </p><p>Now some direct responses to things that have been said so far:</p><p>1. I 100% agree now that a $25 contribution JUST TO GET YOUR NAME LISTED or mentioned is too much. After the feedback here I've decided that, once a month (probably the first week since that's when the Patreons get charged for their donations) I will have a set video (probably a vlog or podcast etc.) that has a special thank-you segment where the names of those <strong>who have donated $5 or more</strong> will be mentioned/shown. HOWEVER, this will not completely turn that piece of content into shout-outs and derail it; meaning, it's not going to turn into a Twitch-like stream where every 5 seconds I'm stopping to play a sound because of a new sub or donation and shouting out thanks, etc. Just wanted to clarify that as a few people seemed to question it.</p><p>2. <strong>The Street Fighter goal was put there as an experiment to see how people react.</strong> I agree that there are MANY people who would not want to see me, at this point, completely change my content/business model into pure fighting games. I DO, in fact, believe that if that were to be one of my goals in life that I COULD get back into competitive fighting-game shape, become at least a semi-decent player at tournament levels and become "someone to follow" in that community again. Mr. Popular, absolutely not, but gameplay/performance speaks far louder than overall popularity. However, I think that would be far too much of a sacrifice at this time; but I'm not taking it off the table that, in the LONG-TERM if I were to reach a certain contribution goal, that I would again attend EVO or just tournaments in general. We'll see, but <strong>this one, for now, is considered shelved.</strong></p><p>3. It seems <strong>everyone agrees on a goal set where I will play games that people/Patreons choose, but nobody can agree on those games.</strong> Minecraft, yes, but the other games (worst of all time etc.) were just my suggestions. My problem will be: <strong>how do I determine what these games will be?</strong> It's not even possible to do a "private poll" where only Patreon members can vote, to my knowledge. So I have no idea whatsoever how that would go down, honestly, and I'm leaving myself open to your suggestions on that. I WANT TO PLAY STUFF YOU WANT TO SEE, but every time there's a public poll we end up with upset people. So how do you figure that out, for people who are willing to PAY to see something?</p><p> </p><p>For people not interested in my response to the "Green screen" goal feedback, you can stop reading now as the response is below and will also be very long. However, PLEASE contribute your ideas to the above as I need your help! Thanks!</p><p> </p><p><strong>For the "taking time off to learn green screen" goal which everyone seems to have issue with,</strong> allow me to clarify in as fair/calm of a way possible. You may not agree, but please don't use this thread as an outlet to go on a tirade about how you disagree with myself and my lifestyle, because chances are if that's the case you don't support me/my content and wouldn't donate to my Patreon regardless! OK here goes:</p><p>Tons of people who use Patreon have goals set up like "reach this amount to finance my new laptop" or "get a new camera when I hit this amount." Nobody seems to have issues with that, because they clearly understand that once that goal is hit, that equipment will be utilized to make better content. Now, I already HAVE the green screen and all of the boom lights needed to set up for green screen use, so in regards to fundraising for them, I don't need any. What I need is TIME, which is something I have drastically little of, despite what you may believe (or are led to believe by whomever). Unlike the people asking for the financial funding to buy equipment, who probably don't do the things that the Patreon is set up to do for a living, <strong>I already have a FULL work schedule of new games, new vlogs/series, montages and things that YOU, THE VIEWERS have asked for</strong>. To actually take<strong> time away from that to learn a green screen or ANY new equipment, for that matter, means time away from streaming/videos and money lost. </strong>There is no "backup revenue stream" that is going to pay for that time away, and with my current financial situation I cannot afford to take unscheduled time off from work. That's just the reality of the situation and<strong> no amount of denial, or disagreement, or uproar is going to change it.</strong></p><p>Now I've seen many replies in this thread (And undoubtedly in the social media feeds of my biggest "critics" I'm sure) stating things such as: <br>-But he has time to watch television every night! He should use that time!<br>-He plays mobile games! He should use that time!<br>-But he's going on a stay-cation for three days this week! Why isn't he using THAT time!<br>-Many other similar things<br><br>To someone who doesn't have a "full life" i.e. the tons of adult responsibilities that I took on when I bought this house/moved in with my girlfriend in June of 2014, from the outside you may not understand that, at all. I get it, because I used to be there. When I started making videos in 2008, outside of my 9-5 office job I had all the time in the world to goof around; and let's face it, once I was laid off in 2010 and this was my full-time gig, my entire LIFE opened up. I could play whatever I wanted, film as much as I wanted, work on edited or non-edited projects. I could play all-nighters and midnight releases nonstop, get drunk whenever I wanted and do drunken/slurred playthroughs. I literally had no responsibilities besides "make sure the bills get paid and keep putting out video content" and life was VERY different.</p><p>Eventually, all that was going to change, and it now has. A normal day for me now probably sees 1-2 hours tops of what would be considered "Free time" that I'm not on a set schedule to get certain necessary things done. Outside of those 2 hours, I'm on a constant basis of running around, getting things set up/working for a stream, recording gameplay, uploading gameplay/naming gameplay vids, adding things to playlists, updating the website, updating the schedule and tweeting; and that's just the business side.</p><p>Personal side: routine daily chores, maintaining the house, paying the bills, preparing for/cleaning up after dinner, taking care of the hamsters, and of course doing routine things with my live-in girlfriend (which is a HUGE change for me as I've never lived with a significant other before) are all things that take up TREMENDOUS amounts of time.</p><p>So outside of business and personal things that are NECESSARY use of time, I maybe get 1-2 hours a day that I use to "unwind" so to speak. Keep in mind, this time is 99% of the time spent w/Leanna so it's considered "shared time" to some extent. The things brought up as "free time you could use to learn a green screen setup/other things" is basically the ONLY time of the day that I actually get to relax. Especially for someone like me with a back injury, REAL relaxation time is a NECESSARY thing for daily operation. If I don't get to relax, my back tenses up/I'm drowsy or agitated, which is going to 100% affect my work for the next day. How many times have I raged at a game when maybe I was just tired? Especially in these days, when I'm now listening to your feedback and making an active effort to NOT do that kind of stuff and be more positive, this relaxation is required to keep up a natural and healthy work/life balance and continued quality of work.</p><p> </p><p>You can completely, UTTERLY disagree with what I'm saying above, and that's okay. Maybe you don't get my perspective, or maybe you're not the kind of person I am and you can work, nonstop, for years at a time with little to no relaxation/free time. I personally don't think it's unreasonable for a person to REQUIRE time to relax/unwind in order to be healthy, and that's always been my philosophy in life. But please, because you disagree, don't think that YOUR way of life is good or "the right way" for everyone.</p><p>The bottom line is this:<strong> if you don't agree with my deserving at least 1-2 hours of free time a day in order to stay healthy/happy and continue to put out quality videos, and you think I need to actively sacrifice that on a regular basis to "improve my business," then you don't get me or any of what this has ever been about. </strong>I'm one man, not a team or a corporation and that's all I'm ever going to be: a self-made man that busts his ass to entertain while he enjoys gaming. I have a passion for what I do, but I'm also mature enough (and enough of a realist) to know that I'm not 20 years old anymore, and I can't NOT rest and expect that my work is going to be great. I honestly think overwork (and not taking the time to be creative enough) over the course of the last 6 years is part of the reason that I am where I am right now. </p><p>So: if you don't get that, then I actively ask you to NOT participate in this discussion because, honestly, you're not of the same mindset as me and you're not going to donate to my Patreon anyway. Patreon donators, when it comes down to it, are either going to be people who 1. enjoy the content I put out and want to see it continue, 2. want to see that content improve or 3. just like me for one reason or another. If you're not of those three, then no reason to ever read any further or waste your time here.</p><p> </p><p>And if you think that taking 3 days off for an inexpensive stay-cation, the first real "days off" I've taken in over 9 months (besides being sick or when my parents visited for Christmas) is unreasonable because "you're asking for money when you are spending your time on other things?!" You don't get me, and that's okay. Please do not donate to my Patreon, and thanks for your time.</p>

<p>So after a month of debate, it seems we've come to the conclusion that doing "perks" for contributors to my Patreon account simply isn't going to work (mostly thanks to detractors who've stated will be $1 Patreons just to give out the perks to everyone else).</p><p>Therefore, I've decided that my Patreon account will be based on set GOALS which will serve as landmarks for level of contribution, each of which will trigger/unlock a new special event. These events will either be 1. ways to give back to contributors/fans or 2. thinks to overall IMPROVE my content in the long-run.</p><p>Before I get started with suggestions, I'll answer the common question:<strong> "Why does Phil need to hit certain donation goals to do these things? Can't he just do them now?" </strong>The answer: Yes, I could do all of the below things right now, but that would mean taking away from my daily schedule of work (i.e. streaming new/remastered/requested games on a daily basis and uploading those to YouTube) which would me a DECREASE in income. The reason I'm using Patreon is to offset the decrease in income I already suffered mid-2014 and I cannot afford another one. Therefore, <strong>I'm setting up these goals in the hopes that the Patreon contributions will offset any decrease in income during the time I'll be taking to complete them, so that I can IMPROVE my content in the long-run and increase overall viewership.</strong></p><p style="line-height:20.3636360168457px;"><br>So far here are the ideas I've come up with:</p><p style="line-height:20.3636360168457px;">-Taking 1-2 days off from gameplay to set up/learn how to use my Green Screen setup (which has been in the closet since last summer). I'll make setup vlogs of it to document the process as well as do demo streams/vids utilizing the green screen. The green screen will then be used in future projects such as vlogs and the Project 7 reboot, amongst others. <br>-My very first "gaming marathon" where I'll stream from 6-10 straight hours (with a few breaks) of a game/series of games that fans have requested. This will include lots of fan interaction in the stream chat (something I don't frequently do) which will make it very unique from my usual gameplay content.<br>-Playing sessions of games that I normally would not play, or that Patreon donators could vote on. The obvious one here that tons of people have asked me to play over the years is Minecraft, but I'd think that would be the absolutely HIGHEST goal out of all of them. There may be more, such as "the worst games ever made" in E.T., Superman 64, Sonic '06 etc. (I'm seriously dreading all of these as I know how awful they are, but I'd be willing to play them if we hit the goals).<br>-This one is kind of out there - but if I hit certain goals maybe I could make trips to Microsoft/Sony/other gaming studios in this area and do studio tours, behind-the-scenes kind of stuff etc. that I could vlog OR give in-depth explanations of (if they don't allow cameras). Living in Seattle has put me into perfect position to do this as many game studios have their headquarters right here.<br>-This one would be the BIGGEST overall goal: I dramatically reduce the amount of overall gameplay content I put out in order to focus on - get ready for this - fighting games. I focus solely on getting into competitive shape in Street Fighter, extensively play/test the new Mortal Kombat, and actively seek out/become a frequent attendee of the local fighting game scene in Seattle. If it went so far, I'd even attend EVO. (Keep in mind, this would be a STRETCH goal as it would mean completely changing up the way I do things and would require a MASSIVE Patreon investment to offset the guaranteed declines in YouTube revenue I'd receive).<br><br>As for perks, we've all but shot down all of them but I believe there are 1 or 2 that we could still do:<br>1. if someone donates $50, I'll put them into Project 7 in some way (webcam video segment, special guest, voiceover etc. per what they're capable of doing). <br>2. If someone donates $25, they get a shout-out that month in the credits or a special segment on my vlogs or shows<br><br><br><br>This is my first SERIOUS attempt at setting up my Patreon perks and goals. Please, if you will, respond with the following:</p><p style="line-height:20.3636360168457px;">1. Suggested prices for the goals (how much to hit to do each one etc.)<br>2. Feedback on the goals (any suggested tweaks, improvements, additional goals or ideas why these wouldn't work?)<br>3. Feedback on the perks<br><br>As always, please try to stay on-topic and refrain from being overly negative (just saying IT WON'T WORK! YOU DONT DESERVE MONEY! etc. isn't going to fly and will result in moderation action) and try to remain positive and constructive. Thanks!<br> </p>

<p>Giving this thread a bump as it hasn't been posted in for a week, and I'm going to make a NEW thread for goals (not perks) as the perks don't seem to be working out.</p><p>At this point I don't think perks are going to work for my Patreon, as everything I've come up with (advanced access to vids, private streams etc.) has basically been shot down by my detractors who have publicly stated they'll donate $1 just to be a Patreon and then make the private things public. I also thought about doing stuff like having someone on as a guest on Hate LIVE! if they gave, say, a $50 donation, but they'd have to use Skype and that could lead to me being DDOSed (again). So right now, all of that kind of stuff is out of the picture.</p><p> </p><p>What I could do and am strongly considering doing, is setting up Patreon GOALS: set landmarks of monthly contribution at which I will do set things to "give back" and/or IMPROVE my content moving forward.</p><p>Please check out the NEW thread for Patreon goals that I'm about to create, and thanks for contributing to this one.</p>

<p>I also like that DESPITE the rewind mechanic, once you make a choice it's permanent. What would have happened if I'd stepped in to help Kate instead of taking the photo? What if I'd left evidence in Chloe's house that I was looking around? It's VERY intriguing.</p>

<p>Never heard of this website, but both "posts" are made in a parody manner, obviously to criticize/satirize people who make a living doing gameplay videos who are now affected by this Nintendo nonsense. And they're both meant to be malicious and mean.</p><p>I don't know why you'd think it sounds like me when, as I've said numerous times, I'm not at all affected by this because I'm a Machinima managed partner. I would easily make the comparison to Angry Joe/Zack Scott games and others who constantly bring this up, though. I've only brought it up twice, once when I was directly affected in late 2013 (until I became a managed partner) and one other time this week when I was asked about it for Ask the King.</p><p>I think that one comment/post from Mr. Smokeslightly may be the only legit one in the entire 2 articles, and it actually does make sense. Although it seems he doesn't get that the post itself is a satire and not serious.</p>

It sends some serious mixed signals and people will call you out on it. As Che said above, if you're going to ask people for money, the least they expect is that you live within your means. I know that the BMW is good for your back, but with the amount of driving you do, I'm sure a less expensive car would be just fine.</p><p>I know it's a touchy subject, but the Supercard debacle is also a terrible mixed signal. You publicly admitted to spending "hundreds of dollars" on WWE Supercard, and while you might say that is "private and none of our business", it still matters when you're telling people you're ostensibly strapped for cash. How would you feel if John Rambo was in need of financial support, and he blew the 100$ you threw his way on virtual currency is various mobile games? It's the same thing; these are real people feeling that want to support you because they<strong> care</strong> about you. You're indirectly giving them the middle finger while laughing all the way to the bank, so to speak. You simply cannot send out the signal of being in financial woes and then publicly spend big on superfluous hobbies. It certainly doesn't help that your fanbase is quite young either, seeing as the $200 you spent on Supercard is <strong>a lot</strong> of money to them. These are the same people that you're asking to help financially support you.</p><p>You cannot just sweep this stuff under the rug with a "This is private and none of your business" when you publicly admit/purposely tell your fans these things. You gave a tour of your leased BMW, you drink expensive bottled water on camera and so on. Yes, it is your personal business, but you're sharing that information with the public while at the same time asking people to sustain a lifestyle that is more than likely much more extravagant than their own.</p><p>Most of your fanbase is teens, people whom wish for consoles for Christmas and games on their birthdays; you bought 4+ different headsets in the $150 range and 4+ different capture devices <strong>just to test them out</strong>. I can't even afford to do that; a single one of those headsets would've been a fairly sizable investment for me, and I'm certainly not in any position to ask people for financial help.</p><p>It can feel like you're asking people to bail you out, but aren't willing to put in the effort yourself to better the situation.</p></blockquote></div><p>​The things you're referencing are completely misrepresented.</p><p>Some are in the past - YEARS in the past (the headsets were in early to mid 2013) before the massive drop-off in views this past June.</p><p>The BMW lease was renewed because if I didn't get another BMW, I was going to have to pay thousands of dollars in penalties for returning the car early, they REDUCED my payment from the previous lease, and the maintenance is 100% covered. It's not expensive at ALL in comparison with cars that require tons of gas/repairs etc., but they DO require you to have great credit to get approved; that's actually more of the hurdle than the monthly payments are. Anyone saying "leasing a BMW is expensive" hasn't done research, especially with the lower-end models. And again, this was done BEFORE the drop-off in June, and can't be undone now.</p><p>Things like WWE Supercard are absolutely ridiculous because they're based on forum posts on ANOTHER forum, where I gave vague info and no specifics - it's incredibly stalker-ish. I've since quit the game in the past month and deleted it from all of my mobile devices bc it's another one of those "you must pay to keep playing or else just lose constantly" kind of deals now, and I'm very much done with that. People completely made shit up when it came to that game and literally followed me in the game and forums to try and guestimate how much time/money I spent on a mobile game - all before I ever announced I'd be doing a Patreon, by the way. I've purposely quit the game because I cannot afford to put money into it.</p><p>"You drink expensive bottled water on camera" - what?! This doesn't even make sense. Are you referencing me drinking Fuji water YEARS ago, again before any decline in views or income? I drink brita filtered water in my stein every single day (and have for the past 4-5 years) so I have no idea what you're talking about.</p><p> </p><p>All of this is incredibly misinformed and honestly, none of anyone's business. People who are trying to formulate arguments that "Phil is living the high live and asking for money" are out of their minds with either 1. misinformation, 2. drama or 3. jealousy. I've NEVER asked for donations until this point in the entire time I've done this full-time since 2011, and if my views ever got back to where they once were I'd again stop accepting donations/Patreon support  - all during which, by the way, many other YouTubers/streamers HAVE accepted donations. So before you get on my case for silly misinformation, you might want to jump on them first, because anybody with more views that me who asks for donations/Patreon support is making WAY more than me.</p>

<p><strong>I'll say one thing in regards to the "get a real job" line of suggestion, and please don't take this as offensive or mean-spirited, because it's not at all.</strong></p><p>You have absolutely no idea how much money I make/have made doing YouTube/Twitch/streaming in the past, present or future. You have no idea how much money I made at my previous office job, or how much I could make getting a new similar job, or just another job in general.</p><p>I'll tell you this: If I were to significantly cut down on YouTube - let's say, I made only 30% of the videos that I make now (and therefore 30% of the income roughly) - so that I could get a job that was EQUIVALENT to my old one (which, by the way, almost doesn't exist anymore and it's incredibly unlikely I'd get that after being out of the workforce for 4 years)...</p><p>...well, I can tell you right now that just staying the course with what I'm doing now on YouTube, despite "declining views" and assuming that things don't at least stabilize or turn around?<strong> I'd still make more money just doing YouTube. </strong></p><p>I certainly won't be rich, I won't be able to spend lots of money and it will probably take me a decade or more to get out of the debt I accrued moving to Washington (that will be relieved a LOT once I'm able to sell the old condo in CT which is bleeding me dry monthly), but staying on YouTube makes more logical and financial sense than "going out there to find another office job." </p><p>Anyone who says that "getting a normal job" is the solution here 1. hasn't ever done this kind of thing for a living and 2. has no understanding of the actual job/financial situation in America.</p><p>I'm not trying to be offensive here at all, BTW - i'm just stating the truth. Most people have no concept of how much money YouTubers actually make. EVERYONE has different fluctuating contracts and deals and nobody can talk about it due to non-disclosure agreements. My "legacy contract" with Machinima is one of the most lucrative ones IN ALL OF ON DEMAND VIDEO (since it's NOT ad-performance based) and I'd be an insane idiot to stop/reduce making video content to go get an office job, taking an insanely huge pay cut and screwing myself over financially. </p><p>So i'll say it once:<strong> stop saying "get a real job" because you're misinformed and don't know what you're talking about.</strong></p><p>Thanks, and I hope you enjoy today's Dying Light vids, which I'm adding to playlist right now.</p>

<p>As a direct result of feedback/criticism on the forums, today I played Dying Light and had a whole new attitude.</p><p>I didn't blame the game when I failed (and I did fail, a LOT) but instead just accepted that there's a difficulty curve you need to learn/get around. I actually got a bit better at combat, utilizing the dodge which I hadn't previously; it was STILL tough but I was able to succeed after a few deaths.</p><p>I didn't say "this game sucks" and I laughed off a bunch of stuff that normal I'd probably flip out about.</p><p>The stream chat viewers seemed pleasantly pleased with it and asked me to try and do so more in the future.</p><p>If you've been criticizing me for the above - give today's batch of Dying Light vids a shot, and let me know what you think.</p>
