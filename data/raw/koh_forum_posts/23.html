You didn't clarify anything of the sort that you typed above. You just Flat out said if you made a TIHYDP video, you contributed to your attempted murder. And just looking back at that video, I hope you understand how ridiculous that statement was in hindsight.

<p>
 How do you clarify something when clarification on a point hasn't been asked for yet? That was the first time I'd EVER been able to reference how TIHYDP could have related to my being SWATed, Because I'd JUST BEEN SWATed. Since then I've elaborated MANY times that it's the people who created tons of slander about me, that created a "Bandwagon effect" of dumb, misinformed kids actually BELIEVING the slanderous stuff, is what led to one idiot prank calling the police here. That wasn't said in detail in that specific video, but it was many times later on, after people asked me about it. How do you not understand that a referencing a video almost 2 years old isn't valid in February of 2017?
</p>
<p>
You're EXACTLY the kind of person I"ve referenced a million times here: to you, the world is black and white. Because I said something once, that is ABSOLUTE, even though I've elaborated on it tons of times since then (many times IN THIS VERY THREAD) and explained the full thought process behind. Want to know who thinks the world is black and white? Simpletons.

Sooner or later Phil you're going to have to take a look around you and think why your fan base has dwindled into what it has and why people around the internet don't have high praise of you. And these aggressive retorts that you have really dont help either. Just make you look guilty in all honesty.

<p>
 Sure, here's the answer: simpleton morons like you, who don't understand how life is, because your brains haven't matured. You think that something said years ago in a video is absolute, than nothing ever changes, nobody ever grows or changes their mind, for your own purposes. You're the worst kind of idiot, nitpicking and constantly taking everything out of context just to get all UP IN ARMS and cause drama. Fuck off, kid. The reason I have fans from the start is because they've been here for the entire ride, they can see the entire picture IN CONTEXT, and they know that I'm not a bad person overall. But a simpleton moron like you watches one video and that's it! Your mind is made up, because you're far too lazy and/or dumb to actually see the entire story.

Good riddance.

I was considering it to practice my video editing. However I am not ok with doing work and someone taking all the profits. I don't believe the exposure is fair equivalance of a reward to compensate for the work done. Other YouTubers.. Those even with less subs and views than Phil compensate montage videos made by thier fans that are uploaded to thier channel.

I think you're FAR overestimating any kind of potential income to be made by these videos. So far, the only OFFICIAL TIHYDP video has about 8k total views; I estimate it might go up to around 10-15k, tops. Guess how much money is actually made on that video? Ad-revenue wise, probably anywhere from $10-25 depending on what ads play on it, how many people use ad blocker, etc. So you're talking about a cut of a TINY amount of profit. The other problem is, data isn't even available for over 2 months after the video goes live (because YouTube analytics aren't "finalized" until 2 months later, and then they send payment to the partner networks). SO would you be willing to go through an 8-20 hour long playthrough, make a very well edited TIHYPD or montage video, just in the hopes of seeing A FEW DOLLARS in 2-3 months? Because honestly? I wouldn't either, lol.
</p>
<p>
This is not a profitable business unless you 1. have videos that get tons of views (which rarely mine do anymore) or 2. you upload in volume and get OK views on everything. The reason I'm still in business is because I DO NOT upload 1 edited video a day; I upload a bunch of raw gameplay that accumulates a total daily views that's enough to pay my bills. It's ALWAYS been like that. 
</p>
<p>
That being said, I have no way whatsoever to monetarily make an incentive to produce videos for KOGaming. I can't afford to hire anyone, and sharing the pittance that is the ad revenue is an utter joke. The most valuable think I can give is exposure and/or a sense of community (being part of the big picture, so to speak). Anything outside of that, sadly, I can't give and therefore I can understand why many people would feel it isn't worth it.

The main focus on this series is it needs to poke fun at your gameplay, the current video does that a little bit but its overflooded with memes to make up for the lack of insults. Poking fun at your bad gameplay is the essence of a TIHYDP. Once you get that and learn how to laugh at yourself more often, this series will be more successful.

Why did you bother to quote my post? You completely sidestepped everything I said: insults about my gameplay are 100% fine. PERSONAL insults about me/my family/gf that make people hate my guts due to mass slander are not. But it's those insults that the morons leaving negative comments/downvoting are ASKING for and saying are the primary thing missing from the TIHYDP posted to KOGaming.

<p>
You have incredibly selective hearing. I said that slanderous, false insults becoming commonly believed FACTS about me, are why I was SWATed, and those are VERY commonly distributed via TIHYDP videos. Do you think anyone honestly cares about a bad gamer? There are millions of them worldwide. But when you LIE and say that I'm a pedophile, I treat my fans horribly on a regular basis, I steal from my Patrons, I'm a regular liar about everything, nothing I've ever done is legitimate ETC. THEN you start to make people think it's true - especially when these "little white lies" become ongoing running jokes in TIHYDP videos. YES, if anyone ever promoted those lies about me, they DID contribute to some fucking nutjob SWATing me. 
</p>
<p>
It's not the idea of TIHYDP that has been dangerous to myself and my business; it's the no-talent, greedy, self-centered pieces of shit who couldn't get any attention making them and/or the morons who purposely leave the slanderous, inflammatory comments, who spread these lies as fact for their OWN BENEFIT that have endangered me. This has NOTHING TO DO with my gameplay skill level, and nobody ever said it did.

You're just making shit up.

<div data-role="commentContent" class="ipsType_break ipsType_richText ipsContained ipsMargin_top" data-controller="core.front.core.lightboxedImages">
<p>
There have been two common trains of thought on the TIHYDP video:
</p>
<p>
1. It had too many memes (so it was cringey): Fair criticism, that can be used to improve in the future.
</p>
<p>
2. It wasn't HARSH enough, in particular because it didn't highlight YouTube comments.<br/><br/>
The video called me a "fucking cunt," had awful pics/insults to my girlfriend in it, and even completely fabricated the act that I'd somehow INTENTIONALLY made a video short to make more ad revenue. "Not harsh enough" in this case means "didn't completely destroy Phil's character and make him out to be the devil through intentional slander." And that's the difference between laughing WITH someone (like a roast) or laughing AT them (to purposely misrepresent and destroy their character). 
</p>
<p>
Now I'm not against more harsh stuff it it's relating to the game, or the like - but the problem is, when TIHYDP went viral, it created a group of brainless, drooling idiots who just spam nonsensical, intentionally ridiculous and insulting comments on my playthroughs in the hopes of GETTING INTO THE TIHYDP VIDEO; i.e. it created a huge group of moronic attention-whores that turned my YT comments section into a septic system of toxic bullshit.
</p>
<p>
If you actually think off-topic, slanderous insults are "funny," you are a fucking moron. If you think insulting my family and girlfriend in a gameplay video that has NOTHING to do with them, you are a fucking moron. If you've EVER posted up a comment on a playthrough of mine in the hopes of getting into a TIHYDP video? You're an attention-seeking, worthless, brainless, idiotic moron who can be viewed as nothing more than pathetic by anyone else with a brain.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
NOW, all of that being said: if anyone actually has a constructive criticism of how to improve the video, fair enough. But "you didn't totally make Phil look like the anti-Christ, so people MAY still want to see his videos, so this TIHYDP sucks!" is not a valid criticism. It shows the insane stupidity, selfishness, and immorality of the common TIHYDP viewer, and just how fucking moronic those people are.

Yeah, now that the series is getting established and people will know what it is, those intros won't have to be very long at all.

For the record: this was the only TIHYDP submitted so far. I'm already seeing stuff like "THIS WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE OF THIS AND THIS AND THIS!

If any of these KOGaming community creations submissions tries to file a false copyright strike against me, I can just dispute it. Nobody is going to actually sue me, and now that we're aware of how utterly broken YouTube's copyright system is, I know I can just have all the issues removed in 2 weeks. So it's literally not an issue at all.

Traditional was apparently the one single person who didn't like the Twitch and Chill marathon, despite my living up to exactly what I'd promised. This was the 2nd time he'd acted like that, as if Patreon goals were Kickstarter projects or something and if he didn't specifically get what HE expected (despite what was actually promised), he exploded like some whiny spoiled brat not getting the exact flavor of ice cream they wanted.
</p>
<p>
He personally attacked me, I ignored it and calmly explained to him how Patreon works. He continued to insult me and I just stopped caring. Haven't seen him since, but he's not banned, just permanently removed from being able to be a Patron, since he can't be a responsible adult about it.

Phil often calls his channel his "business". On that perspective, his subs would be his clients, but no business man EVER talks to his clients like this besides Phil. Let's see if this criticism is taken lightly, and don't forget that DSP is more than 30 years old, so his feelings towards a client's comment hardly matters.

There's a huge difference between how you treat paying customers or someone who just walks in the door and shits all over everything. Although YouTube is VERY much my business, it's not the same, at all, as a paying business where you can lawfully have the "loiterers who aren't paying for anything and causing nothing but trouble" legally removed. 
</p>
<p>
Since there's a HUGE difference between a "paid for/purchased content" business model and a "for free" business model, no, not every single person is a customer. They'd be categorized as potential viewers. However, the internet is also a VERY different place than a brick-and-mortar business. You're gonna get tons of shit-throwing morons because it's anonymous and there's zero consequences for it (as opposed to say, a bunch of dumb teenagers egging a physical business, which would lead to them getting arrested). 
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of boring, vanilla, "fake" YouTubers who pretend to be the happiest people on Earth on a daily basis. They also put out the most vomit-inducing, generic, meaningless content available. Here, and on my YouTube channels, you get the REAL me; not some pussyfooting "character" who want to kiss everyone's ass for the sake of a view or a dollar. I've been like this my whole life, and although I have learned to be far LESS angry/butthurt about stupid shit, I'm not going to dramatically change into someone fake and/or more restrained at this point in my life.

That's exactly the point. People around here seem to view harsh criticism as just treating Phil like shit. What Hazzer did was just that, harsh criticism, but everyone acts like he did nothing but insult Phil.
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Spoken exactly like someone who has no idea what they're talking about, and should keep their uninformed fingers from typing misinformed posts in this thread.
</p>
<p>
Hazzer's post contained NO criticism. What it contained were severely slanted half-truths from the perspective of someone who has refused to ever take responsibility for his own actions. There is a long history here and just because someone posts something up doesn't make it "gospel truth." Quite the contrary, if you see someone coming in here out of nowhere to post up a text wall, it's probably bullshit or spin for some other purpose. 
</p>
<p>
Case in point: Hazzer USED to be a big fan of mine, but when TIHYDP started, he basically jumped right on board with that group, deriding me rather than laughing WITH me. He befriended those making TIHYDP and was a part of spreading it. HE advertised and promoted TIHYDP on those old forums (along with a bunch of others) which caused a HUGE rift among the posters; it got to the point that there was SO MUCH overwhelming negativity that I stopped using them entirely, and actual fans gravitated away from the site entirely. So of course, from HIS perspective, he did nothing wrong, was a spotless, shiny person who only wanted to laugh! And I'm an evil demon of a man, who never would allow anyone to make fun of him, nor receive any criticism whatsoever!
</p>
<p>
In reality, he's a jackass who has refused to ever man up and at least take "partial" responsibility for the downfall of the old forums entirely. Until TIHYDP, NONE of the negativity towards me existed; everyone laughed WITH me and understood that I wasn't taking gaming seriously, and everything I did was for the fun of dicking around, while enjoying gaming and sharing those experiences. I didn't CARE that I was a bad gamer, because I wasn't trying to BE a good one. TIHYDP basically turned that into "well, he sucks, so never watch him again, just make fun of him in these videos" and people like Hazzer PROMOTED THAT ATTITUDE everywhere, including the old forums. It took a lot of patience for me to even let him back, and for the most part he was being incredibly helpful and productive around here; but when he's going to post up his incredibly one-sided BULLSHIT because he's never grown up, and he's going to say it's ME who won't accept any responsibility for TIHYDP (when I've done so NUMEROUS times now) when in reality it's HIM (and others) who fucked a LOT of stuff up in this community over it?
</p>
<p>
He can rightly fuck off for good.
</p>

Now, THIS THREAD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS. So either move on from being off-topic or I'll lock it entirely.

Parodies are fair use. I said this in the other topic but CinemaSins and HonestTrailers make hundreds of videos that consist SOLELY of ripped footages from films and TV shows and make parodies/critiques of them with MILLIONS of views. And they are very clearly making a profit. So how exactly do the TIHYDPs not count? 
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
First off, those businesses getting millions of views may actually be getting permission and/or have spoken to the movie studios' legal departments to hash out any issues in regards to their video content. If they're literally doing NOTHING in that regard? Then what they're doing IS completely and utterly illegal. Just because the vast majority of movie studios haven't stricken them to death with copyright strikes doesn't mean it's allowed OR legal; it just means nobody is willing to prosecute. Keep in mind, it's one lawsuit PER VIDEO on YouTube to get something actually taken down properly. I'd be willing to bet that most movie studios don't care enough about the negative exposure they may get on YouTube from these guys to sue.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Cinemasins could be viewed as a "review" of a movie, except they reveal the entirety of the plots and use a TON of footage. In court, it wouldn't hold up, because it would be argued that by watching Cinemasins you've basically expunged enough of the original work that a person would not want to go watch that movie themselves, constituting copyright infringement/theft.
</p>
<p>
HonestTrailers are more of a parody, where you take the original trailer and manipulate it enough (different voiceovers/scenes etc.) to be something completely different than intended; so that one IMO would be more of a "grey area" if it were to go to court. 
</p>
<p>
TIHYDP are NOT parodies. When you watch an HonestTrailer video, it doesn't purposely exclude the vast majority of the trailer to make Schindler's List look like Schindler was as bad as Hitler; it doesn't say that the cast of Father of the Bride were pedophiles. It doesn't turn Ride Along into a movie where the protagonists kill cops. That's EXACTLY what TIHYDP does: unfairly represents what the entirety of my Playthrough actually is, by ONLY emphasizing certain aspects disproportionately to make me look bad; then adding in incredibly slanderous, insulting statements from the comments of said videos to compound the misrepresentation of what the Playthrough actually is.
</p>
<p>
When you watch an HonestTrailer video, you don't want to kill the people who made the movie. When you watch a TIHYDP, a LOT of them make you want to never watch a single video or stream of mine, and to publicly deride/slander me to the point I can't make a living. That's the difference: INTENT. And intent has quite a HUGE bearing on what is considered to be covered Fair Use or not.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
One more comparison: History Science Theater 3000's entire premise is to take "shitty movies" and talk trash over them, making fun of how bad they are. Guess what? They can only do so for movies which 1. they've gotten legal permission or 2. are public domain (no longer protected under copyright law). For CURRENT, NEW movies, they have RiffTrax: where they record their voices while watching the movie, but it's YOUR responsibility to legally purchase the movie, then play the RiffTrax audio simultaneously with it to get their commentary. They CANNOT just do a standard MST3k video over a NEW movie, because even though you could say "it's parody/review/fair use" it still wouldn't be covered.
</p>
<p>
The VERY same premise goes for TIHYDP. So until a court rules that the MST3K guys can do commentary over copyrighted movies, TIHYDP will always be illegal.

-Because I rage at the laggy online play of a fighting game and lose a lot online, it means I'm overall an awful fighting game player, no matter what factual history says otherwise.
</p>
<p>
-Because I've criticized others whose primary YouTube appeal is overreacting to things on facecam (i.e. Pewdiepie), if I EVER use a facecam for anything, it's incredibly hypocritical.
</p>
<p>
-Because I've criticized those who do "paid advertisement" videos on YouTube, when I unbox a LootCrate, it shows I'm a pure hypocrite sellout (even if I legitimately criticize the contents of the box as good/bad based on what I find inside).
</p>
<p>
-Because I called out Toby Turner in a video some 5+ years ago for advertising on my videos, it's incredibly hypocritical for me to EVER have issue with a YouTuber name-dropping me in a negative way, regardless if I've ever had relation to them or said anything negative about them in the past.

I could go on for fucking ages, but the summary is thus: they're moronic idiots who haven't grown up yet, and haven't matured in their thinking to understand how life really works. And it REALLY shows through their actions.

It's not a matter of emotional. If a game or developer is properly on the receiving end of criticism, there is nothing wrong with it. However, if the shortcomings are on the player themselves because they are incompetently doing something, lacking apparent common sense in a situation, or they're just a really bad player, CONSTANTLY shifting blame makes you seem like a massive man child. THAT'S where the success of TIHYDP came from.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Um, no? The first few in regards to Metal Gear Solid, where I was PURPOSELY DOING IT for the sake of the playthrough? To some extent, yes. Every single TIHYDP? Fuck no! They became so incredibly unfair, that any time I ever even say a VALID CRITICISM of a game, it's now chalked up to "Phil's ineptitude" and the like. 
</p>
<p>
EvilAJ's videos were well done and pointed out that I basically wasn't really trying when I Played MGS 2 and 3. But the vast majority of other TIHYDP videos are unfair, PURPOSEFULLY misleading/insulting and done for the sake of insult. NOT as a criticism that I "blame it on the game devs" constantly. Wake up.

Your original premise was that the majority of your fans were massively against TIHYDP.
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, no, not at all. The majority of my fans didn't give a crap about it, because they liked my raw playthroughs and streams, and didn't care about anything outside of that. It was a splinter group of both those who were concerned and those who loved the TIHYDP stuff that blew it out of proportion, IMO. 
</p>
<p>
The problem with TIHYDP is that, at its core, it's one-sided and negative. So what happened was, as always happens with a fanbase, people were getting older and moving on from watching YouTube videos...but very few newcomers were coming in to replace them, because they'd seen TIHYDP and thought I was a clown IRL; that I was better to laugh AT than laugh WITH and therefore I didn't deserve to make a living doing this.
</p>
<p>
Without having a possible influx of new viewers to replace the old, my business dwindled. TIHYDP shut off people who weren't my fans from watching my stuff; that's how it hurt me long-term.

How can you possibly extrapolate 50 people messaging you to the majority of your fans? I think you are very quick to project the opinions of a few people you agree with to your entire fanbase.
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Congrats, you've taken a single line referencing a single instance as if it was the only thing that ever happened.
</p>
<p>
ORIGINALLY, about 50 people contacted me over the original TIHYDP video. Just so you know, that's a LOT. I get random messages all the time, but it's very rare to get a direct subject addressed by so many people all at once like that. But that was just in reference to the very first video ever made by EvilAJ. 
</p>
<p>
After tons of these things were getting pumped out, I was getting CONSTANTLY contacted by people about them. Mostly people who were horrified that the videos were legal and that I wasn't doing anything to take them down, since they portrayed me so negatively. In retrospect, the original EvilAJ videos did NOT do that as much as the ones made going forward after that, which were pretty pathetic and more for shock value than anything else. But at the time, the originals were the only ones out there, and when I had the amount of people talking to me about them daily, it was obvious they were severely bothering my fanbase.
</p>
<p>
It seems that YOU are very quick to assume that a single statement I make in regards to one particular situation is some kind of universal fact applying to everything infinitely over time. This is your shortcoming, not mine.

Also, one last thing. Responses like this where you hurl insults at people calling them empty headed morons are exactly why so many people don't like you. To put it frankly, you come off as a dick a lot of times. You could really take a page from the other people I watch in terms of how to respond to people saying things you don't like. It's honestly as simple as just calming down before you respond.

It's this exact pussyfoot attitude that has created an entire generation of "safe space" self-entitled whiners who can't take any kind of adversity, or even admit reality. It's the reason why everyone who's big on YouTube is a complete fucking phony. It's the major reason people are so damn stupid. There's a difference between saying something in the moment you DON'T mean, or saying something with enthusiasm. I waited about a week watching everything this Quasimoto guy posted, and suffice it to say, not only is he a moron, he's the same person I've banned about 25 times now. He thinks he can hide his language style and mannerisms, but he's not that smart.

Hazzer, I've waited the greater part of 4 years to unload on. So pretty sure that wasn't something that was going to change by "calming down" lol.

Doesn't really make sense. All the TIHYDP videos, especially of the Dark Souls series, are in the millions of views. Plus they're not monetized so why would they get pissed that video of yours in the likeness of the tihydp series got 6,000 views in *checks channel* a week being up? Doesnt seem too logical
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most of the stuff you post up here is factually wrong. Not EVERY TIHYDP video is in the millions of views; in fact VERY few are. The first few, the handful that kind of got all the attention. After about a year, the fad died out as a "mainstream thing" and people moved on. It's only a certain group of a few thousand people who refuse to move on from it. It's very hard to find a TIHYDP video in the last 2 years that even got 10k views (compared to the insane amount of them that get uploaded and nobody cares). 
</p>
<p>
The people downvote-spamming the montages on KOGaming and flooding it them with assinine comments are those who are angry I'm taking content I didn't personally produce and uploading it to my channel, because they feel that "TIHYDP has done it better" for years. In reality, every single TIHYDP is my legal property, but because of YouTube's incredibly broken copyright system, I'd have to file a lawsuit FOR EVERY SINGLE VIDEO that i wanted to claim. Therefore, it's not legally viable. HOWEVER, now that the TIHYDP trend is dying, but people still want to make creative videos like these, I can easily feature them and give them THOUSANDS of views they normally wouldn't have gotten, lost in the huge jumble of people still trying to make these 4+ years after they were actually popular and getting nowhere.
</p>
<p>
In summary: I've bided my time, and am now properly utilizing my own still-existing popularity (Albeit FAR less than I used to have) to showcase videos that normally would go ignored, and I'm profiting from them because they were made from my content to begin with. TIHYDP "fans" HATE that fact because they, all along, have NOT been "laughing with me" but "laughing at me" and trying to get popular, on their own, through HURTING myself and my business. Seeing these videos actually HELP me is like their bane, because they're miserable, low-life scum suckers who get their jollies out of hurting people they've never met, and whom have never done a negative thing to them. They're the lowest form of life, and since they can, they'll downvote these montages THAT AREN'T EVEN TIHYDP VIDEOS because they think it's a "dig" at me and anyone who supports me.
</p>
<p>
In reality, it just showcases their own mental illness. And there's a LOT of these dumb fucks out there.

Yeah but you go the distance to make sure nothing critical is visible in the section, I got the video in my notifications and was the first 500 to watch, there was a few comment saying "this is tihydp" or "this sucks", relatively light to the kinds of comments I see flashing in the usually TIHYDP videos. Like right now I count 1, 2, 3....22, 23 comments including the replies with the 4 or 5 being your own. It's says up top that 69 are suppose to be present. Meaning you deleted 45 to 50 comments Phil. That's a lot.

<p>
The YouTube comments system governs ITSELF. It auto-flags spam, hides comments, etc. without the input of the uploader. I hadn't even checked up on the comments on the first KOGaming submission for over 12 hours, went into the section for the first time, and saw this comment:
</p>
<p>
"WOW, says there should be over 100 comments but only 60-some are visible. Phil has been busy!"
</p>
<p>
To which I replied:
</p>
<p>
"This is the first time I'm in these comments. Paranoid much?"
</p>
<p>
I'm tired of taking flak because people, like YOU, are too fucking stupid to understand how the comment system works. Yes, I'll delete an occasional nasty comment here or there, but I have FAR BETTER THINGS to do with my fucking time than sit there for hours, manually policing every single comment. I don't even look at the comments on most of my videos anymore, because I know that YouTube has allowed the section to become 100% toxic and worthless. Most viewers don't look there either, because they're smarter than that.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, you really are a moron to blame comment flagging on me. That's like, YouTube 101.

Great, because no lies have taken place. You have this incredibly skewed view of what happened on the old forums, mostly because you were part of the problem. There were a group of actual fans trying to use them, while at the same time, there were a group of self-entitled, elitist, "good ol' boys club" asshats who were using the forums for their own personal purposes, instead of actually constructively contributing to things that needed input (like how to actively improve my content). And YOU were a major reason why those forums failed, because you were trusted as a long-standing member to help out, and instead you took major advantage of me and my kindness.

<p>
When TIHYDP first launched, I was contacted in HORROR by about 50+ people stating how appalled they were, that someone would steal my video content and spin it in a way to make me purposely look bad. Admittedly, I didn't watch the earlier videos in their entirety and I honestly don't even remember HOW I initially reacted. But I do know it certainly wasn't acceptance, and it was overblown. It was the first time I'd ever really faced that kind of negativity for simply playing games and enjoying myself, and I didn't "get" it, or that it was criticism of any form. Mostly because, nobody was coming to me and saying "hey Phil, your playthroughs are too negative and they'd be better if you didn't do this or this." Instead it was blatantly stolen content (yes, every single TIHYDP is theft and not protected under any kind of Fair Use law, from the mouth of a Copyright Lawyer i've consulted) that was seemingly (at the time, I thought) being used to 1. deride me and 2. get others popular off of my hard work. The fact that for months, I was bombarded with people telling me about EVERY SINGLE new video that was released, how awful they were, and that I should "take action to take them down" didn't help things.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in your little isolated world of the forums, you and your boyfriends were circle-jerking each other about how great those videos were. Nobody read the thread besides your own elitist group, and at the time there was SO MUCH NEGATIVITY on the forums about me (and none of it constructive) that I was actively staying AWAY so that I could remain positive and focus on my work. It was this division, created by you and your "bros", between your little group and the actual fans who wanted to use the forum for constructive purposes, that eventually led to its degradation and downfall. 
</p>
<p>
Name ONE other YouTuber who would, annually, spend the crazy amount of money I have to maintain a stable website/forums for the fans, even when the majority of the people that use it DON'T actively contribute in a constructive way? But you, and your "buds" didn't care; you saw a free opportunity to have a hangout place, and you continued to use the forums for your own purposes, never contributing to anything useful. You "blew up" threads like TIHYDP regularly and were basically a bad influence, while the actual fans just wanted to see SOMETHING positive on there.
</p>
<p>
The reason TIHYDP got as popular as it did, was exactly because of people like you: exploitative, unappreciative, and selfish. Make fun OF, laugh AT (not with), DERIDE instead of joke. Yes, I've made tons of mistakes over the years, as I'm pretty sure there's never been a "guide to internet fame" and my "Being real" with everyone has backfired probably as often as it's resonated positively. But for you to come on here and take absolutely NO responsibility for any of your actions over the years is not only appalling, it's downright immature, puerile, a quite honestly? Thanks for finally posting your one-sided, incredibly distorted "truthful view" on what happened in the past.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Now I can finally tell you this publicly: fuck off.

Isn't it a bit unfair to say that eveyone just loved TIHYDP back in the day? I don't even know how to verify that claim. But if phil said he didn't like it, I suppose he wasn't  alone in thinking some of it went to far, and was unfunny.
</p>

<p>
The only reason I even knew about TIHYDP was because of my fans, who contacted me, appalled they existed and wanting me to take them down. I literally wouldn't have ever known nor cared if people hadn't told me that they were mean-spirited, copyright infringing and that they were going to hurt me in the long run. I got exactly ZERO messages from anyone saying "wow, this is great, you should make these yourself!" or "you should support these!"
</p>
<p>
The thread Hazzer is referencing was NOT a "happy thread about how TIHYDP is great." It was a thread basically ripping me a new asshole, saying I was a horrible gamer, a horrible person, and the video was hilarious for calling it out. If featured posts mostly from people who were taking advantage of me, and using the forums for their own personal "clubhouse" to shoot the shit about stuff unrelated to me or my content. Nobody who was an actual fan agreed that TIHYDP was "good" or "funny" when it originated.
</p>
<p>
It's just happened organically: TIHYDP grew to the point where people saw them, then came to my channels and VERY few actually became longtime fans. But it certainly didn't happen the way this idiot Hazzer just painted it; that's his incredibly insane, distorted view of things from a VERY biased side of the fence that I don't wish to ever revisit.

A pointless statement. To continue to do nothing rather than actually try something, regardless of the timing, is fruitless. At least something is being attempted here, as I wasn't a clairvoyant or time traveler who could have foreseen what would happen with TIHYDP and its effect on my business/popularity overall back then, when it started in 2013. In fact, nobody did; most people who were actual fans of mine were insulted, appalled and pissed that TIHYDP even existed. Being that I was powerless to stop it due to YouTube's complete lack of respect for copyright law enforcement, the only other real, logical alternatives that I had were to 1. denounce them or 2. ignore them. I started with 1, moved on to 2, and neither helped.

<p>
Another pointless statement. The hundreds of dislikes are from morons who are PISSED that videos are getting attention that aren't hyper-negative. Despite these videos clearly NOT being titled "This Is How You Don't Play," because they aren't those videos, the same dumbfucks who watch them are spamming dislikes on THESE videos and leaving vast majority of comments such as:
</p>
<p>
"This isn't a proper TIHYDP"<br/>
"I'll stick to TIHYDP"<br/>
"Phil has STOLEN the idea of TIHYDP"
</p>
<p>
...and the like, among tons of insults, swears and things that you'd normally hear on the schoolyard. The comments are utterly fucking pointless, from an utterly stupid, uneducated group of morons who don't understand that THESE ARE NOT TIHYDP VIDEOS!
</p>
<p>
Why on earth would those insanely stupid comments be left there? When someone writes incredibly puerile, perverse, stupid nonsense on the walls of a business or a public restroom, you clean the walls, no? You don't leave the shitstains smeared all over the place. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Important to note, I've already said publicly and repeatedly that the next fan-submitted montage WILL be a proper TIHYDP, with insults and the like. More akin to a seriously negative roast of a comedian/celeb etc. than just fun stuff in a video. And I approved it!

It's not that it's not "Easy." In honesty, the core gameplay (i.e. going through the levels) is actually far easier than Dark Souls IMO. I'm only dying a few times, if any, on new stages; I think I died twice in the entirety of the actual stage I played today. Instead, EVERYTHING was on the overly cheap boss.
</p>
<p>
The bosses are very hit or miss. I died a ton to the General, and enjoyed the hell out of it, because it was a fair but very challenging fight. Great timing allows you to win a very one-sided fight where he can kill you instantly at any moment, very daunting, but rewarding.
</p>
<p>
Centipede boss was utter crap. Can't hit the damn thing cleanly without getting hit yourself, EVEN WITH A SPEAR which has the best range of all melee weapons. The thing randomly stunlocks you (which you can tell is unintended by the game devs, it's just a mistake they neglected to fix) for an instant kill. It takes ages to set it up to finally damage it legit (having to kill the "tail" segments etc.) and it's far more of a puzzle full of tedium, rather than a challenge.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, today's boss (Umi-bozu) was more of the exact same kind of terrible boss design. First, you have to light three hidden torches to effectively fight it (unless you randomly took enough fire talismans, which you wouldn't know you needed beforehand) making the stage twice as long as it needs to be. Then, when you fight it, not only can it do an incredibly fast/cheap instant-kill move at any time, there are damned holes all over the boss room that lead to accidental and cheap instant deaths. It's like, not only can we make the most tedious possible boss, but then we'll put the same fucking holes in the floor from the Bed of Chaos boss in DS1 JUST to make you die more and have to keep starting over.
</p>
<p>
In comparison, the first 2 bosses (Onryoki and Hiro-enma) are FAR better, gimmick-free boss fights worthy of this kind of game. So I certainly hope they didn't stack the game with this other kind of cheap, time-waster bullshit.

I can also see how some would be upset/offended by that meme, although I personally am not.

It'd be nice if certain parties could actually pay attention/focus on what was going on during the stream instead of totally derailing chat. Yeah, Gino is one of those people who tends to drift away from the actual game and the like.

Actually, no, that's not what happened at all. Fans came to ME on this, I thought it was a good idea, and I realized that if I made it into something official I'd probably get far more people interested. I'm not expecting to get anyone with already existing HUGE FOLLOWINGS submitting anything, and that's fine. The bottom line is, if you can't benefit from the exposure, then why would you want to be part of the program anyway?
</p>
<p>
As for financial compensation, please tell me you're joking. The average video on my KOGaming channel only gets 5-10k views, which ad-revenue wise won't ever top $5-15 each. If you think putting in the work of a highly edited montage is going to be profitable because it's on KOGaming, you're wrong. The idea here is to get stuff EXPOSED to those 5-10k people who watch. If your average channel video views are far above that 5-10k, then there's zero incentive or reason to ever put your work on KOGaming. This program is meant to give creative people exposure who otherwise can't get it, not to "pay people for making montages."
</p>
<p>
<strong>The fact is, legally I own 100% rights to EVERY SINGLE TIHYDP VIDEO EVER MADE, and if I sued for it, I would own all of those videos and could put ads all over them. </strong>As in, I could be making thousands of dollars on the stolen footage used for TIHYDP without permission. However, I don't have the time nor the money to take every kid to court who makes a video without my permission. Therefore, the KOGaming Community submissions program is a way for me to benefit from those who actually OBTAIN PERMISSION to use my work to make something creative, and meanwhile I give them exposure so it can be shared with others. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
If you're looking to make money with illegally stolen videos from DSPGaming, you're barking up the wrong tree, bub. There's a reason why you can't make a montage like "This is How You DON'T Make a TV Show: The Walking Dead" on YouTube; it's called copyright infringement. Just because I don't have the money or legal backing of AMC, doesn't mean I don't own the rights to every single derogatory video that's ever been created about me, that contains my gameplay. The sooner you awaken to this reality of things, the better. None of your "circular logic" arguments based on phantom evidence of "transformative works" mean a hill of beans when it comes to actual legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>
If you'd like some exposure, great! Let's talk about a montage for KOGaming. If you're looking to line your pockets because you stole my videos and made a montage? Hit the road, jack.

<p>
I've already explained this in other threads:
</p>
<p>
It's the difference between laughing WITH me, and laughing AT me.
</p>
<p>
Skysand's video highlighted my deaths, sure, but you did notice he also highlighted some great moments (finally beating those tough bosses, beating Smough and Ornstein on the first try, etc.). There's no malicious intent in the video, and if you watch it, you'll probably be INTERESTED to watch me stream/play other games. So in the long run, a video like that benefits my business, I laugh at myself a bit, and we all have a good time and benefit from it.
</p>
<p>
Watching SOME TIHYDP vids (not all, but sadly it's the nastiest ones that get the most attention overall), they're NOT about laughing WITH me at all. They degrade me, they're meant to be purposely insulting; they certainly do NOT show the good moments EVER, only the bad. The comments they show are insanely slanderous, erroneous and make people think I'm a horrible person. They're laughing AT me, at my expense, and sadly the vast majority of people who watch those videos would NEVER watch my live streams or raw gameplay on DSPGaming (and they say as much in the comments; they purposely don't watch anything of mine until a TIHYDP is made, so that I can't make any money on their viewing of my stuff). And so, in general, THOSE kind of TIHYDP videos CONCRETELY HURT my business. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
This literally has nothing to do with earning money on the videos, as most TIHYDP videos aren't monetized by the uploaders. But they benefit in other huge ways: tons of views/attention for themselves, getting "elite status" in negative-centric communities like the SOK and the like. All at the expense of another potential new viewer, who now thinks I'm a scumbag and will NEVER watch my content from my own channels, hurting my livelihood. 
</p>
<p>
With this new program, everyone benefits: the uploader still gets the public recognition they deserve (in fact, MORESO than they probably would have on their own channel as KOGaming already has over 20k installed subs) and even gets to tell me specifically what they want plugged. I make a few bucks off of each video, but more importantly, it keeps content new and fresh for KOGaming (in particular, this will be VERY important when I'm swamped with new releases and can't constantly pump out videos for the channel, such as what happened in 2016). 
</p>
<p>
OH YEAH, and the biggest positive: it'll actually attract people to my channels rather than deter them. Nobody watching these new montages on KOGaming are going to think I'm a human scumbag because the creator is a self-serving, selfish, conscience-ignoring dingleberry who only got any kind of notoriety because they used my stolen content to begin with, and I don't have enough time/money to file a lawsuit to take down each and every individual TIHYDP video uploaded to YouTube.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
That's the definitive answer.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Since the program launched last night, I've already gotten three offers for new videos on 3 different game playthroughs I've done. And they keep coming in. So obviously this program was a good idea.

If I donated to him out of sympathy because he needs to pay his bills, then 3 days later see him on Instagram going to the movies and eating out... I would feel the exact same way if I gave some money to a homeless person holding a "Hungry" sign and then watch them go to the liquor store with the money I gave them.

<p>
You, and everyone who thinks like you, are the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet. And you've already been banned OVER A DOZEN TIMES, why do you keep coming back to spread your bullshit?
</p>
<p>
I never said I was DESTITUTE. I never said I'm in a situation where I have no credit, and am about to have my fucking house repossessed. YOU may have made that shit up, but I certainly did not say it, nor did I ever allude to it. I speak the truth, YOU spin it to be what you want for your own negative purposes.
</p>
<p>
What I did say: in January, I've had a HUGE dip (i.e. at one point THOUSANDS, but now it's not quite that much, thank God as the stats for the month updated slightly for the better) in my YouTube income, despite having MORE views, MORE engagement and people loving what I did for the month. If I didn't have a significant increase in income from other sources (Patreon/Twitch) I'd literally have a hard time paying my bills in March, when that lower YouTube payment would be coming through.
</p>
<p>
I also said that if things don't turn around (i.e. if I don't have an overall increase in income on the whole moving forward from January) that I wouldn't be able to sustain my YouTubing/Streaming as a business and I'd be forced to look into other options (i.e. getting an in-person, full time job) despite the job market still being bad, my being out of the workforce for 6+ years and the chances of finding one that would actually replace my YouTube income is slim to none. The proverbial "rock and a hard place," so to speak.
</p>
<p>
So, please, by all means, explain to me where in the above statements that I made in last week's vlog where I said I'm destitute, I would NEVER, EVER eat out ever again, and would never have any kind of pleasure-seeking activity that costed money. That I would sit in a fucking corner, staring at the wall fore the foreseeable future, because YouTube screwed me in January.......oh wait, you're an idiot.
</p>
<p>
Going out for a "Date night" once in a blue moon (we hadn't been to the movies since June 2016, which I even SAID in the instagram post, but you cannot fucking read) does not break the bank. Because I accept Patron money, it does not mean I'm locked into a strict regimen of ramen noodles and sawdust for meals, and that I cannot go out with my girlfriend to a decent dinner ONCE a week (we eat in every other night, with the exception of if we get something for DSP Tries It, which is filmed for a show and pays for the cost of the meal). Because I accept WILLING PAYMENT for services rendered (ongoing daily live streams and videos) does not mean I'm a fucking SLAVE to the money and cannot ever spend it in moderation; it would be one thing if I had blown it on expensive jewelry, or something insanely frivolous. I'm pretty sure everyone deserves a night out with their significant other every once in a while, regardless of the fact that YouTube income was severely lower in January than usual.
</p>
<p>
There's a reason why I've been able to maintain an 8+ year successful YouTube presence, while you're just a miserable fool on a message board who keeps coming back after being repeatedly told you're not wanted here, because you're a moron.
</p>
<p>
Do yourself a favor: stick to your jealous, circle-jerking group of no-brain buddies and leave the intelligent thought to the rest of us. Just sit back and enjoy the ride of life, because lord knows you'll never do anything worthwhile when you can't even think yourself outside of a paper bag. And be sure to share this message with them, so they all know how useless they are to everyone else on Earth. They NEED to know.
