This is one thing. This falls into line with what I brought up earlier, i.e blatant flame with no real sort of criticism to build upon. That's different than someone asking for less plugs or asking him to stop speaking about the views that playthroughs aren't getting and so on and so forth. As Phil himself said, he's looking for concrete ways to improve. I'm sure that many people can differentiate between both sides. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Okay, if I hadn't done any of that? i.e. if I never mentioned views, never plugged Patreon, and all the "constructive criticism" that I got in this thread? We wouldn't potentially have a Halloween special, or a Rock-a-thon, AND I wouldn't be able to pay my bills.
</p>
<p>
So not only don't we get special events that people like, I'd get criticism saying I'm stale, AND I'd go out of business. All the while, people scratching their heads, saying "I wonder what happened and why Phil never addressed it?"
</p>
<p>
Do you see the difference here? There's criticism and then there's just ridiculous nitpicking. EVERY BUSINESS EVER talks about how it's doing, advertises for promotions and events, etc. MOST successful YouTubers now have Patreon or another means to contribute outside of just watching their videos (merch, donations/crowdfunding, and the like). Yet it seems ONLY the people posting up here have such huge issue with it, because it's ME. 
</p>
<p>
That's not criticism. That's unfair, biased persecution. Everyone else can survive, but when Phil takes measures to do so, he's in the wrong! And that's why it's not valid and I'm not going to accept it.

I sincerely hope your taking this serious Phil. So far your reactions to some of the legit criticism in this thread are proving your detractors right and providing a bigger amount of "lulz" for anonymous trolls that dwell sites like /cow/.
</p>
<p>
I would advise you to think carefully about how you word yourself. I've been a fan for some years and would hate to see you crash and burn and only be remembered on the internet as that "TIHYDP Guy". Regardless I'll watch how this ends.
</p>
<p>
Can't say much else considering everyone else had already told some insightful and blunt truths in this thread. 
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not exactly sure what you're talking about, honestly. This is a single thread amongst hundreds that have been the same kind of pile-on attitude over the years. Not to say that there haven't been great things contributed (there absolutely have) but the banner of "Phil doesn't listen to any criticism and calls it all hate" won't fly for intelligent humans anymore. I've changed far too much for anyone with a logical, analytical and FACTUAL approach to anything to say something like that and thing it's true.
</p>
<p>
If you want to join that group, go right ahead. It's the increasing number of vapid, empty-headed negative-focused do-nothings that seem to be taking over the internet in droves and made TIHYDP popular in the first place. It's an actual cultural movement of people SO deluded they think that "unifying to hate on someone who can't defend himself!" is some kind of valid social interaction. It's not, it's sickness, and I really don't give a shit about it.
</p>
<p>
Valid HELP is appreciated. Making 10 threads all saying the same negative stuff, while never EVER contributing to something positive, is not. There's a strong difference between the two, and no, it's not "all considered hate" but it is considered useless, negative, and detracting. 
</p>
<p>
Again: if you don't understand the difference, it's probably because we're two different people of different ages, in every different positions. That's OK, but don't crucify me for not being you, thanks.

And yet, with all of that said, you fail to even acknowledge that there IS a mass negative element here on the forums that is dragging it down. People barely use these forums BECAUSE OF ALL THE NEGATIVITY, not because we attempt to censor it. That's an incredibly stupid statement.

Who could tolerate being part of a team whereby the head honcho could insult whoever he liked, breaching rule after rule,  but if anyone dared question it, they'd disappear.

Yeah, this is so crazily one-sided and BS I have to call it out. YOU WERE NOT HERE. Almost ever, for an extended period of time. Because you saw ONE case without proof you assumed that everything I did on the site was unwarranted. It was not. It's not just about rule breaking, it's about constantly dealing with people who are trying to stir the shit and make the website an unpleasant place.
</p>
<p>
That means removing negative elements if all they do is post up negative stuff, even if it's not BLATANTLY rule-breaking. I was barely using the site, and the few times I took the time to, all I saw was insane insults, negativity and nothing positive. BUT THEY FOLLOWED THE RULES! Who would want to visit that site?
</p>
<p>
I seriously can't believe anybody else on the planet would pay over $1k a year to run a website where that stuff was allowed.

You cannot be serious. We've spoken about this in the past, and you told me then that you understood why we did what we did. I was here for almost 5 years before I left (university &gt; administrating someone else's forum) and I'd put my full endorsement behind every single moderator and administrator that I chose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU </strong>made moderating a pain in the arse with your almost daily twitter outbursts and we told you that multiple times. Not only did we moderate effectively (given the website ran absolutely smoothly for 4/5 years nonstop). If you'd like me to show you our conversations between the admins/mods and you, I can do so, since I screen-capped much of it. The fact you dare even say we used this site as a personal hangout is insulting at least, and downright idiotic at best. We spent <strong>years</strong> making your website work. It's a thankless job (especially since you literally never spoke to us, unless you were going to complain about something), but we did it for you, for free, for years, with no hiccups or complaints (until the end). We put up with your pessimistic attitude for thousands of days.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit it: I stopped watching your stuff a bit over a year before I left. <strong>So fucking what?</strong> Does that stop me from making sure your website runs? Hell no. The fact that you'd deride us in public, saying we didn't moderate properly, that we didn't like you, and that we just used your money to socialise with each other was out of order then, and sure as hell is out of order now. What have we done to you in the past year to warrant this sort of treatment? I wouldn't treat you this way. I'd honestly like an explanation.
</p>
<p>
The straw that broke the camel's back was you creating rules and retroactively banning people. Given you're quite informed about law, you should know that's not the way to apply them. Honestly, I'm insulted you'd bring this topic up again, and insult us yet again, after a year.
</p>
<p>
The funny thing is that I watched your stream yesterday for the first time in <strong>years</strong>. You've just totally put me off doing it again. For the love of fucking god, get a PR person.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
With that being said. I'm done.
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
We've had this conversation multiple times and I've told you multiple times that the issues I had with mod staff weren't with you, at all. You keep making it about yourself when I've told you over and over it wasn't you - you were busy at university and barely had time to do anything on the site.
</p>
<p>
AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM, because the people left in charge ran the website like their personal clubhouse, devoid of rules or fair moderation except for their own sections outside of where my viewers/fans would actually want to post.
</p>
<p>
Seriously don't know how many times I have to repeat myself here that it wasn't you; the site ran badly without you being here but always was great when you WERE more active. That changed and the forum moderation turned into shit, and you know it.
</p>
<p>
Stop making it about you personally.

To add to this, just to make it clear. It was <strong>me</strong>, and only <strong>me </strong>who did some dumb shit after we stepped down. I tried to ban Phil's account, thinking surely that wouldn't be possible, yet it was. Problem is, this was done after everyone else had been stripped of power, and since I never had the power to unban people (being a mod, not an admin), I couldn't rectify the mistake and there was no one else to do it. All the porn and hentai shit wasn't posted by me; but I didn't remove it either, and found it quite funny. I apologized for this later on, and I know it was retarded. Ironically, most of it was posted by a person <strong>who was later promoted to moderator on this very website.</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Beechey, DXMichael, Lemon, Hazz3r and the rest put so much work into the old forums - WAY more than I did - so throwing them under the same bus as me is downright disrespectful. <strong>I</strong> made a mistake, not the other staff. Just because Lemon had the same powers as me when the forums went to shit doesn't mean he did anything with it.
</p>
<p>
Am I proud of what I did? Fuck no. But I won't let you keep blaming people who worked their asses off for you for years to keep a fun community going. It's fucked up.
</p>
<p>
Everyone involved can back me up on this.

<p>
Yes and no. Although you were the person who messed stuff up a bit, we found out someone else had admin access behind the scenes who shouldn't have, and was also messing with stuff at the same time. We eventually had to wipe the slate clean because we had no idea HOW or WHY they had access besides a possible back door to that forum software...which is one of the reasons we went with something completely different this time.
</p>
<p>
And it certainly WAS NOT just you who was turning a blatant blind eye to the insane amount of trolling on the old site, so you can stop that right now too. Most mods WERE only using it to talk about stuff unrelated to me and didn't give a shit about the topics that should have been focused on. And no, nobody who was posting hentai is a mod of this website; if it's who I think you're referring to, they were a trial mod who was demoted once found they were hiding their true identity.

So I've cleaned up the thread a bit, removed the negative influences who have only been here to shit on things, and now we can progress with constructive discussion. You'll notice a lot of people who only turn up to complain/shit on things won't be posting any longer, and good riddance.

I've noticed a steady decline in topics related to your content ever since the last iteration of the forums closed down and this one came up. This isn't new, really. You scared too many regular contributors away when you shut down the last forums and left them on hiatus because you were frustrated by the negativity. I would know, since I was registered at that time and recently came back. 
</p>
<p>
There used to be topics regularly made for your playthroughs. Now, that doesn't even happen and only a few hardcore fans have remained since the last exodus (I don't consider myself a hardcore fan, but I still observe). I hate to say it, but many former members didn't like how this place was run (there were some mods causing issues, as well as you deleting some posts using a questionable justification). People joked that it felt like the internet equivalent of North Korea. You have to admit that something was probably askew if the mods of the last forums, supposedly chosen for their responsibility, revolted and refused to moderate because you backed down on a promise not to ban people unreasonably.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Yeah, except that none of that actually happened. The last forum staff was a legacy staff of people appointed 3-4 years prior, most of which didn't even watch my content anymore and weren't even qualified to be moderating. We had a MASS influx of detractors/SOK/whatever registering, posting, derailing, even outright insulting myself and my girlfriend and that mod staff was not moderating the site properly, at all. They spent more time in off-topic general discussions that had nothing to do with me or my content, and were greatly neglecting the areas of the site that my actual viewers would want to use. They instead used the forums as their own personal hangout, at my expense, with the premise of "but we moderate for free!" as their excuse to do so.
</p>
<p>
How can you tell when site staff don't care about you or your actual site? When they hold you over a gun and say that you, THE OWNER OF THE SITE, cannot take any moderation action without being approved by a panel of other mods. I agreed to that, as long as they continued to moderate the site fairly and in a timely manner - which they did not. So they decided to leave (which I told them I was okay with 6 months prior, but it took them that long to finally decide to do so) and turn it into a HUGE drama-fest for their own personal attention, when in reality it was a non-event. 
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah - then 2 of them abused their power before they could be demoted, totally destroyed the administration portion of the website, posted porn/hentai everywhere, corrupted the database, and we had to start from square zero. As in, rebuild the forums completely.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
So in summary, I never "shut down the forums and left them on hiatus because I was frustrated by the negativity." This is such a gross misstatement of what actually happened that quite frankly, I'm offended. What did happen: legacy mods who didn't watch my content/care about me anymore were still in charge, repeatedly failed to do their jobs, then refused to allow me to do any kind of moderation on the site. After being told repeatedly to leave, they finally did, then 2 of them destroyed the site (Because they no longer had a personal playground to mess with) and we had to rebuild it from the ground up. Just ask Onyx what a fucking mess this place was before he redid it on a totally new type of forum software.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you shouldn't believe everything you're told from sour, immature people.

I pretty much have to agree with everyone else here. Not all criticism is meant to be an attack or insult or what have you. A lot of it is because people do genuinely care about you and want to see your brand succeed. I know I have a lot of respect for you Phil as we've butted heads on Twitter, but you always debated back and forth with me. Yeah, we had to agree to disagree but its those times where you don't just automatically block/mute someone but discuss it with the person that makes me respect you. However, as I just saw in this topic you also have a tendency to make hasty assumptions. You think anyone that has complaints, criticisms, tips, and so on for you are automatically "trolls", "haters", and "detractors". That's not always the case.
</p>
<p>
Everyone on YouTube deals with the same kind of shit you do. You think Pewdiepie, ReviewTechUSA, TotalBiscuit, Jesse Cox, etc. don't get told they suck and worse things (like "hope they get cancer and die" and other just down right <em>disgusting</em> comments)? They do, every single day. The difference between them and you is they ignore those and they also take advice from their viewers and use that to improve their content, not ignore it all as "trolling". You're not perfect and you never will be. No one is. We're not asking you to perfect nor are we trying to sling mud at you (okay, some people do but again like the other people I listed, just ignore it). Maybe you should step back from YouTube for a day or two, take a well earned break to calm down and enjoy a couple days off. Come back refreshed and maybe read some of the posts for what they truly are -- helpful advice.
</p>
<p>
No one will mind if you take a day or two off from doing gameplay videos/streams if it means you'll come back in a better mood because this attitude you showed in this topic really is only going to turn more people away from you. The problem I see is you're too wrapped up in your work and too dead set in your ways. We aren't asking you to change who you are as a person, but just to make some minor changes like don't name call, don't cuss at us, and in general don't treat us like we're just numbers (or in the case of Patreon, like we're just dollars). You have feelings, but so do your viewers. We aren't machines made to watch your content nor are we free money.
</p>
<p>
Also to mention, shutting down the forums would be a horrendous decision. You think it'd be a way to cut off people from "nitpicking, griping, and bitching"? It wouldn't. They'd go to Twitter like they already have, they'd email, and you wouldn't be able to stop them. However, on the forums there's a better chance for discussions between members and yourself to (hopefully) help you improve your channel and in turn, your business. People have just wanted to give <em>constructive criticism</em>. As I said, we aren't asking you to change your entire persona nor are we asking you to be perfect, but we also don't want to feel like we aren't allowed to point out flaws and list ways to improve on said flaws as well as not feel like we're just numbers and dollars in your eyes.
</p>
<p>
Treating your viewers better can go a long way to making the "trolling" go away. All I ask is you step back for a day or two, read the posts with a calm and open mind and figure out what needs changed and how you can better yourself and your business. I don't think I'm asking too much here. 
</p>
</div>

<p>
You have some valid points but also some REALLY gross overexaggerations that are pretty unfair. To say I don't accept any criticism is pretty insane considering the amount of changes I've made in the past 2 years as a direct result of feedback from viewers; I ask more now than EVER for feedback, but the problem is that people complain about every little change/decision as if I'd never listened to anyone. INSTEAD of just giving me the benefit of the doubt that I did actually listen.
</p>
<p>
If you think I only treat my viewers as dollar signs, you have some kind of personal issue with me or with people who use Patreon altogether then. Because the vast majority of people who use Patreon plug it more, do far stupider goals than I do, and don't get shit for it. You seem like you're caught up in the fantasy world of the detractor children who think that everything I do is to make a buck. Sure, all of that social media interaction that I've dramatically increased is very much paying off tons of huge dollars! And all that merch that I DON'T sell or push constantly like other YouTubers! Seriously, you can't just say blanket statements like this without some kind of justification. If you think that my mentioning Patreon in prestreams is excessive, you need to open your eyes and look at what other people who do YouTube for a living are doing first and THEN judge me fairly.
</p>
<p>
When I'm appealing to people for help with things like Patreon, I'm talking to the people who actually care and want to see this thing continue. Even if it does mean they have to give $1 a month. Because they're the ones who are going to listen and help - not people so insanely and unfairly critical to say that I only see my viewers as dollar signs. Very insulting thing to say.

<p>So it's perfectly acceptable for everyone else on the internet to open up a Patreon and push it, but not me. Despite the fact I was one of the VERY few people able to support myself ONLY on YouTube income for 4+ years and never accepted donations or any other income during that time (even though people ASKED me to accept other forms) and I refused, but now that I've done it, I'm in the wrong.</p><p>So it would have been okay for me to accept free money from viewers when I was super popular and making tons of money, but now that I'm not, it's not allowed? Logic defies many of you.</p><p>Yeah, I've criticized others for e-begging when they do it DURING THE CONTENT OF THEIR STREAMS. As in, it's blatantly obvious why you're streaming if every time someone subs on Twitch, you stop the entire thing to play noises and thank each and every person; just like it's blatantly obvious why those people are donating in the first place (to get attention on a stream with lots of viewers). I've NEVER said that accepting donations or having a Patreon in general was wrong - but complete morons who only want to talk trash about me will say that I'm a hypocrite when in reality, it's just that these sociopathic children are following me everywhere, and turning my EVERY move into something negative. Fuck them.</p><p>I never interrupt my gameplay content for shilling anything. It's all contained to prestream/post-stream or an update vlog etc. and will always be. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't like Phil mentioning Patreon so much!" Pretty much everyone else who uses Patreon mentions it during EVERYTHING they do, I only mention it during prestreams etc. So grow up and realize this is a business, and there will be advertisement at appropriate times. Or else when the business fails and I can't do this anymore, you have nothing to complain about? But let's face it, the majority of people who are complaining aren't actually in it to see me be successful anyway, are they?</p><p>Really want me to stop talking about views and Patreon so much? Pledge to Patreon. If 1/10th the people who watch my stuff did $1 a month, you'd NEVER hear me mention it again. But if you're not willing to do that but STILL want to watch free content daily? Then YOU have no right to be a dick to me about mentioning views and Patreon. You can't have it BOTH ways, genius!</p><p> </p><p>And I'm seriously done listening to the insane nitpicking bullshit. "You're still streaming too much, you haven't changed at all this year!" when in reality TONS has changed. Everything I'm doing is in reaction to feedback: play more games, do less montages (which is why Alan Wake never continued); stream less but don't completely abandon it especially with the new releases coming out (yet I still get told daily I'm streaming too much/NOT ENOUGH no matter what I do) etc. Nothing is ever going to be perfectly how YOU specifically want it, so either you can enjoy it or move on; but don't sit here posting up bullshit and then do nothing to contribute.</p><p> </p><p>Which is exactly my point: the thread title is SUGGESTIONS but all I see are negative observations: views are down, Phil talks about views too much, Phil talks about Patreon too much. Well the sun is too hot, water is too wet, and sand is TOO FUCKING DRY. That's all well and good but how about some actual suggestions to help instead of turning it into a bitch-fest? Because this is why I stopped participating in the forums so much in the first place: everyone wants to dump, nobody wants to help.</p>

It's greed at its very worst: we know this is a false copyright claim, but it's our business and we OUTRIGHT REFUSE to remove it to protect our own asses, despite having no legal grounds to stand on.

No, I'm not hoping for clicks. I say this because I want you to understand where I'm coming from.</p><p>"When they get [a donation] they interrupt the stream."</p><p>I agree that this is highly annoying and find it difficult to find good streamers who don't. Good on you for not doing it.</p><p>My feedback:</p><p>1) Focus on re-building. The channel, the viewer base, your reputation, etc. You have a bad rep, regardless of why you think that is.  Work from a position of knowing and accepting this and moving forward. Stop blaming "haters," stop blaming "kids," and for God's sakes stop saying things like "I'm being attacked by sociopaths!" Stop complaining about views repeatedly. Stop bitching about things that you haven't actually researched (ie; the Ice Bucket Challenge.) Stop blaming the game/bugs/devs for mistakes that you make.</p><p>A great example of improvement on your part was in Transformers vs the 3 boss Insecticons. You kept dying but you kept a more positive attitude. You didn't blame the game, devs, etc.  More of this! I absolutely understand getting pissed and blaming the game as I've had problems with it too but have worked on it myself due to viewer complaints.</p><p>2) Change your attitude re: your viewers. WAY too often you talk about how people aren't watching your videos, how ppl have asked for certain games but then don't watch, how people USED to spread the word but don't anymore *cough hint cough*, etc. </p><p>You're mindset needs to be "What can I do today for my current viewers? What can I do to make them happy? How can I win back people I've pissed off over the years? How can I clean up my reputation?"  The kicker here is that you have to start taking responsibility and ownership of your faults and work hard everyday to overcome them.</p><p>The "haters" are going to nitpick everything you do, keep making fail montages, etc. So what? There's nothing you can do about it. Focus your time and energy on what you CAN work on.</p><p>3) Stop complaining about views. This isn't about being transparent or not making a personal connection with your viewers. There is a gap between sharing the personal side of your life/channel and beating a dead horse.</p><p>It has absolutely nothing to do with ignoring what's important to your business. The views are YOUR problem, NOT your viewer's. Just because you're facing some hardships with your business doesn't mean you talk about it constantly to your viewers/customers.</p><p>Imagine if you had a favorite restaurant you visited daily for lunch. Every day, the manager would come by and complain about how business is slow, they are barely able to stay afloat, they've had issues with vandals, etc. Would you really want to hear this every few days? Sure, if you knew they were having issues you'd want to do what you could to help, but eventually you're going to get tired of hearing the manager complain and stop going.</p><p>It's incredibly frustrating to work hours and hours on SEO, audio editing, finding optimal encoding settings, etc., just to have those videos get ~30 views.  But you know what? I mostly keep that to myself. I want my viewers to relax and have fun after a day of work/school/whatever by watching my content. That doesn't mean I don't talk about these things at all, but I keep it to a minimum.</p><p>I have to put forward that you saying things like "I think viewers take me for granted" burns my ass. The viewers are what make it possible for you to do what you do!! The fact of the matter is is that there are 100's (if not more) of unedited Let's Play YouTube channels who don't do screamy-face cam that they can turn to instead; YOU rely on them, not the other way around.  </p><p>The stone cold truth is that people like us who do unedited gameplay are a dime a dozen. You need to re-build your community and love that community. Without our viewers and without our communities, we aren't shit.</p><p>Anyway I had a load more to say but I'll stop now. </p><p> </p><p>-------------------</p><p>TL;DR: Stop complaining about views, stop blaming the game/dev/etc (you've definitely improved on this front,) stop blaming "haters." Stop crapping on other YouTubers/Twitchs streamers. Focus on your viewers, fixing your image and re-building your channel. Build, nurture, and respect your community.</p></blockquote></div><p><span>FYI somehow this comment got flagged a spam (probably because it was so long) but I did read it.

<div data-role="commentContent" class="ipsType_break ipsType_richText ipsContained ipsMargin_top" data-controller="core.front.core.lightboxedImages">
<p>A few quick responses:</p><p>-I'm actually far LESS negative these days that I used to be. As in, I actually enjoy games a lot more and am less apt to blame a game/game dev like I used to. I can actually name a few cases in MGSV, and just last week in Transformers when there were some harsh difficulty spikes, but instead of going NUTS like I used to? After some initial rage I regrouped, learned and progressed. I'm doing that a lot more as a gamer now. Sadly the stigma of my doing it constantly years ago apparently doesn't clear up, because most people don't watch the new stuff but instead just talk about those old situations (not saying they don't happen at all today, but it's certainly way better now).</p><p>-I certainly don't remember anything about a Black Ops II beta, but for Tony Hawk, that game was AWFUL and it's agreed across the board how bad of a game it is. You may have just watched the one thing recently that WAS really bad and I raged on, by sheer coincidence. </p><p>-The Trick2g situation is solely based off of him staging a SWATing and is spoken from the perspective of someone who HAS been SWATed and had his life put into danger. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the quality of the stuff he does on a daily basis (and indeed, I never referenced nor criticized that at all). But the fact that 1. he did it and treated it as a joke, 2. he then created an air of hype/drama around it to PROFIT OFF OF IT is incredibly disgusting. As I said in my original statement: how someone who has a legit fanbase for good reasons and then could choose to do something like that SOLELY for more attention is incredibly insulting and disgusting. There are people being SWATed daily and it's a SERIOUS CRIME, not to be taken lightly. There is no defense from a logical, mature standpoint that can justify a fake SWATing at this time in 2015. If it weren't an increasingly more dangerous epidemic in several years? That would be a different story. But certainly not now - and the way that Twitch handled the situation was so unprofessional, it outright proved they're only in it for the money as well (which is sickening). AND the second that Trick2g decided to "Fake SWAT" for viewers, those viewers became nothing but dollar signs, and so did EVERYONE whose ever been SWATed for real. Seriously disgusting.</p><p>The other things you're mentioning when it comes to Twitch streamers don't apply to me. If I were to constantly be interacting, the on-demand videos that I make for YouTube (which are the majority of my income and viewerbase) would be ruined. YouTube viewers have FREQUENTLY expressed disappointment the few times that I even reference the stream chat, because they're not there live to share in that experience. I didn't get popular because of the "boom of live streaming" like the people you're referencing here, I got popular doing offline playthroughs and that's what the majority of the viewing audience are coming for. My most popular series as of late was Until Dawn, where the live stream was disabled and I played the ENTIRE thing cold, offline, with on stream chat or interaction. Completely flipping that formula would NOT work for me, despite it working for many others on Twitch.</p><p> </p><p>But yeah, overall I can see your points. I'm doing what I can to change, improve, and constantly become better based on feedback. But when I DO actively do that (ask any active viewers from the past 2 years about how I've improved) and instead of positive change, I see months during a busy gaming season with the worst views I've EVER gotten? I tend to react and talk about this stuff publicly.</p><p>Seems the only way that I can get attention would be to copy the formulas of others, which I certainly don't want to do. Either becoming an "edited video/comedy YouTuber" or an "interactive Twitch streamer" would greatly compromise what I've strived to do on YouTube since day 1.</p><p>So what exactly is the right choice?</p><p> </p>

<p>That's all well and good, but saying stuff like "Phil's commentary isn't entertaining" is a waste of time. If you don't like my commentary, you're not going to watch my videos, period. It's obvious there IS an audience that likes my commentary and has been since 2008. We're not trying to nitpick and say obvious stuff here.</p><p>Looking for concrete suggestions for improvement, not just overgeneralized observations that have existed since I started on YouTube.

<p>People will want to see me play Fallout 4 because my Fallout 3/New Vegas playthroughs were some of the best on the internet for various reasons, and are the first time tons of people actually saw my videos and enjoyed them. Fallout and its DLCs were one of the major reasons (along with SF4 and a few others) that i stood out from the rest of the YouTube gamers at the time who only played competitive stuff like COD, etc. I'd think that a TON of people who watched my original Fallout playthroughs would want to watch me play Fallout 4.</p><p> </p><p>By the way, thanks for the discussion in the thread. It's been very intelligent and *gasp* trolling-free, lol. I'm using it to formulate a strategy and have already put something into motion with Machinima, but no idea how they're going to respond. We shall see.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In response to something else said here regarding the SPEED at which I complete games: I purposely slowed down on completing games, balancing multiple playthroughs and taking my time with each one, because that's what DIRECT viewer feedback told me to do during 2012. LITERALLY, the big criticism back then was "DSP rushes through games, skips most of the content and sucks at them because he's in such a hurry to move on to the next game." So instead of that, I started playing more than one game at once, and took my time with the playthroughs. Games like Persona 4, Witcher 3, Bloodborne and MGSV (to name a few) show that VERY big difference between how I handle games now and back then. </p><p>So if you're going to make the point that "Phil takes a long time to beat longer games" as if it's a bad thing, sorry but that's invalid. My viewer base requested that I make that change at a time when they said all of my content was getting stale because of rushing. I do feel my game playthroughs are BETTER (higher quality) now that I take my time with them instead of rushing.</p>

You get nitpicky about it. What I mean by that is the way you do it results in situations where the website itself shows that you hit yhe goal but then you turn around and say that, because of the fees, you didn't. You're basically telling us that in order to actually hit all the goals we need to get it to a minimum of $100 above the highest goal to account for the fees. So what you're telling us is that even if you were at exactly the amount of funding for the goals and every pledge went through you wouldn't hit the highest goal even though your Patreon page shows that you did. It's not really that big of a deal but it does bother me a little.</p></blockquote></div><p><span>That's not true, at all. Twice this year I didn't technically hit the $1250 goal because of the fees, but I did the events anyway. I even publicly stated on Twitter last night that I'd do the Halloween marathon if we hit $1250 of FUNDING despite the fees. I may bring up the fees from time to time, but it's never been a factor in actually performing the goal rewards.</span></p><p><span>I think what you're actually talking about is what Patreon shows as being raised vs. what actually is, which I cannot help. Right now Patreon shows that I raised $1480.90 in September which is a blatant lie; it doesn't take into account anybody who gets declined or put up false pledges. Right now I've actually gotten around $1100 in "cleared" pledges for the month of September, but the page STILL shows as $1480.90, making people think I raised another $380 that doesn't really exist.</span></p><p><span>This is a HUGE issue that everyone who uses Patreon has complained about and they claim they're trying to work towards a fix for it, but so far have come up with nothing. I can imagine some people who are far more popular than me having HUGE issue with this - imagine if you were trying to raise $10k a month but $5k out of that were false pledges, but showed on your page? That's pretty insane and that's the reality of the situation right now. Patreon launched as a site/business that apparently NEVER factored in trolling at all, which is pretty ridiculous in 2015.</span></p><p><span>So yeah, the Patreon charges don't factor into goal rewards at all and never have, so I don't know where you're coming from with that.</span></p>

<p>Deleted all posts in response to and originating from a sock account from SOK that constantly posts insulting nonsense here. But a good time to bring up a subject.</p><p>Yes, Patreon is also income for me (DUH!) and I've made a decent amount of money on there this year, but nowhere near enough for me to be free from the confines of business sense. Regularly children/people with NO knowledge of actual finance/business say stuff like "Why doesn't he just play whatever he wants regardless of views? PATREON is supposed to allow him to do that!" because they somehow don't understand that roughly $1k/month in Patreon funding isn't enough to run a real business. It wouldn't even be enough to pay my basic business expenses (internet/electricity/game cost/website upkeep costs just to name a few things) on a monthly basis. </p><p>Patreon has basically allowed me to operate at "business as usual" levels after I saw a HUGE dropoff in viewership after I moved last year. Yeah, it's absolutely true that when I moved from Connecticut to Washington, I lost about 25% of my viewerbase for pretty much no reason; there was no other correlating event besides my taking a few weeks off to move. I could speculate for ages on what caused it, but instead I've focused on moving forward positively and improving my content.</p><p>This year alone, I've improved both my audio quality bigtime (through a new microphone and soundproofing of the office), got my green screen setup working, massively improved the quality of my edited videos (through new more expensive software and time invested to learn it), did 5 "marathons" (something I've never done before) and played a TON of games I never would have in the past (Minecraft/Persona 4/Yakuza 4/Fallout New Vegas Hardcore Run etc.). All of those are big improvements - and I NEVER made any extra money to do them; I used Patreon to stay at the same income level that I'd made in previous years due to the dropoff in viewership in the Summer of 2014.</p><p>So for those that like to talk out of their asses with zero actual knowledge of anything (I know they're hear, reading this with their sock accounts), keep at it; this is why you'll never operate a successful business.</p><p>In 2015 I've done a TON of new stuff/improvements over previous years, while making NOTHING whatsoever extra from those previous years. I'm doing my best to pay all my bills while I continue to pay down my moving debt from last year. Would I have spent as much as I did if I'd known there would have been a HUGE dropoff in viewership? Probably not, but that's all just hindsight and means nothing now. I have to keep doing what I'm doing to survive.</p><p> </p><p>REAL TALK: If there weren't so much negativity/drama/lies about me out there (right now the big one is that I'm scamming everyone regarding the Halloween special, which is a preposterous lie) I'd probably have double the Patreon funding that I have now - and THAT would actually allow me to have some freedom in what I do, and finally allow me to not really worry about views on every project I work on/game I play. But we're not there yet, and the fact that I'm not able to offer the perks that the vast majority of YouTubers who use Patreon offer (advanced access to videos/projects, special streams and the like) BECAUSE of detractors means that I'm extremely limited, and there's not much I can do to raise more funds.</p><p>The bottom line? If I were unable to make videos consistently for say, a few months because of financial troubles, I think I'd have far more Patreon funding. But the fact is, I've CONSISTENTLY provided free video content since 2008 (and live streaming since 2013) so most people just take it for granted that it's going to be there regardless. Right now I'm doing okay, but if something were to happen that wasn't expected (i.e. a financial crisis of some kind) we could realistically end up in that situation.</p>

<p>Her company is incredibly small-scale. For her to make enough money to pay the mortgage? She'd have to grow about 5-10 times in size/orders, which means she wouldn't even be able to operate out of this house without significant improvements to the business, her workspace etc.</p><p>She also had a ton of startup costs (getting licensed, insured, cost of supplies etc.) which she has a long way to go to making up for before she can officially be considered a profitable business. FYI, MOST small businesses that are home-based start up that way and take quite a few years to become profitable UNLESS they somehow become insanely popular overnight, which almost never happens.</p><p>She's had a great start this year with a consistent customer base, tons of positive reviews and some great exposure because of our existing internet presence. But to be truly successful she's going to have to stick to it for years and grow the business even more; we've talked about in-person events locally that sell this kind of stuff and some other ideas too.</p>

<p>Every month so far, I've gotten about 1-2 BIG pledges that don't go through. Sometimes the people lead me on with private messages about it, but ultimately I find out they're just trolling.</p><p>This month I've now received over $600 in what appear to be false pledges, and because Patreon is a VERY troll-friendly system, there's no way to tell what's legitimate and what's not. The total amount you see on my page is incredibly false, yet to the common viewer they'd think I'd far exceeded my goals and am doing great.</p><p>It's a massive downfall of Patreon: they want everyone to be honest/up-front with what they make, but the site owners are too lazy to implement a change that actually shows LEGITIMATELY what's pledged. I've gotten two messages from Patreon in the past year saying they're implementing that, and nothing has ever come to fruition. There are people who primarily make a living off of Patreon who get screwed over monthly because of this.</p><p> </p><p>But yeah - increasing the Patreon goals won't help anything at all. Once people get declined for these big pledges in the first few days of October, I"ll remove them from my page and we'll see how much is actually legit.</p>

The reviewer is probably saying "you should definitely play this game". A low score, i.e. 3/10, would have the message of "avoid this game". There will always be flaws to a game. Like people said, it is impossible to make a perfect game. Journalists realize this, so their reviews are simple suggestions as to whether it's worth buying the game. </span></p><p><span>tl;dr 10/10 scores mean that gamers should play those games.</span></p></blockquote></div><p><span>No, saying "you should play this game" means YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME.
