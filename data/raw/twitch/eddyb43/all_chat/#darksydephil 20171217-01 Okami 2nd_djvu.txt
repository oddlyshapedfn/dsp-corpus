[11:14] <jbowler21> yay more okami. but from the way phil's talking it sounds like he won’t finish it due to low 
veiwership.5Y‘Z 

[11:15] <mattty3888> the asian games are boring ..sorry

[11:19] <mattty3888> did player unknown get good viewrship yesterday?

[11:20] <jbowler21> okami got 370 something 
[11:20] <jbowler21> on the premiere stream 

[11:21] <mattty3888> i wonder if highdr numbers equal higher tips etc? 

[11:22] <jbowler21> that's what phil is aiming for right now. 

[11:23] <mattty3888> did he say he cant play on pc and stream it? 

[11:24] <jbowler21> keeps going on about his taxes and needs viewers and tips so he can save his house next

[11:29] <gamemaster2003isdead> no just my mind 

[11:29] <bethelewd> baby well she is the mrs 

[11:29] <jbowler21> my bad 

[11:30] <bethelewd> bethefeug comes in sometimes 

[11:30] <bethelewd> then baby is here 

[11:30] <bethelewd> everyone in this chat has lost thier mind 

[11:31] <gamemaster2003isdead> welcome to the happy home 

[11:31] <bethelewd> mmmhmmmm 

[11:31] <bethelewd> welcome to MY playpen 

[11:33] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:33] <bethelewd> hello phil 

[11:33] <bethebaby> Welcome. 

[11:33] <darksydephil> we’re up to 298 subs again, very nice 
[11:33] <jbowler21> phil! hi5Y™,5Y™, 

[11:33] <bethelewd> :) 

[11:33] <darksydephil> thats amazing considering the 20-30 "fake" subs from October are long gone, we legit 
earned them now! 

[11:34] <bethelewd> that is amazing 

[11:34] <gamemaster2003isdead> phil hows it going 

[11:34] <darksydephil> okay stream going live in a sec 

[11:35] <jbowler21> phil will you finish okami at a later date even if it gets out voted? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> its going alright, i kind of feel bad that this playthrough isn't looking good to continue, 

considering the vids on youtube have like 100 views each 

[11:35] <darksydephil> but i have to do what's best to keep my house, ya know 

[11:35] <gamemaster2003isdead> can you at least play okami once a week 

[11:35] <darksydephil> maybe, as like a shorter stream 

[11:35] <darksydephil> we’ll have to see what happens 

[11:36] <darksydephil> it certainly can't be a focus unless things pick up today bigtime 
[11:36] <darksydephil> like i said, Zelda BOTW was a similar situation but people really showed up and were 
cheering/subbing/tipping constantly so it made up for it. that didn’t happen with the first okami stream at least 
[11:36] <gamemaster2003isdead> ok thanks for considering it 

[11:36] <jbowler21> as long as you finish it eventually i'm cool with that phil.5Y‘ □ □ 

[11:37] <factorbactorjr> having it as a side playthrough for now seems to be the best way to go until you get out 
of the slump

[11:53] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[11:53] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Animals on fire 

[11:53] <lucifrend> you should just drop the game unless you're ready to put 40-50 hours in. Yes, Okami is as 
long as a JRPG

[11:54] <gamemaster2003isdead> phil will you be playing okamiden okami's sequel after playing okami cheerlO 
[11:54] <paddingtonbearl87> SnowWut 

[11:54] <bethelewd> youtube is like :0 bomb HOW DARE YOU 
[11:54] <wxrxaxtxh> hello hello 

[11:54] <drilbit777> probably not since its a ds game @gamemaster2003isdead 

[11:54] <arcticsurface> At least i hope Phil wont completely drop the playthrough and continue it during it 
downtime perhaps. 

[11:54] <bethelewd> hello wrathy 

[11:54] <theycallmejimbob> hey WxRxAxTxH KonCha 

[11:55] <wxrxaxtxh> hey guys 

[11:55] <bromanreignz> its almost like advertisers dont want trigger words in their Videos Phill. You just 
figured this out years later 
[11:55] <jmon_1985> A 

[11:55] <lastkryptonian94> cheerlO I feel like could have just said "The playthrough's not doing very and it's 
getting flagged so I might have to drop it". 

[11:55] <bethelewd> phil is putting this playthrough on a second stream once a week side playthrough 
[11:55] <arcticsurface> He is? :0 

[11:55] <theycallmejimbob> USF2 the good ol days dspPepe 
[11:55] <bethelewd> he said he is considering that 



[11:56] <musclesforbones> I will watch everyone. SnowWut 

[11:56] <arcticsurface> Oh please sweet lord that would be REALLY good! 

[11:56] <vooxxy> Sup DSP 
[11:56] <tylerjku> smoke trees 

[11:56] <musclesforbones> that's cause Okami = poo poo 

[11:56] <bromanreignz> do a playthrough of Final Fantasy for the ness it will get zero views. 

[11:56] <tylerjku> dude your audio is glitching 
[11:56] <bethelewd> okami indeed is poo poo 
[11:56] <bethelewd> dont know why jim likes it 

[11:56] <lastkryptonian94> There really was no need to go into this much detail about this haha. 

[11:56] <wxrxaxtxh> so is DSP going to finish Okami yes or no? 

[11:56] <leonaras> @darksydephil Okami is more fun to watch than PUBGzzz 

[11:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe not too popular on twitch either only 3 streamers including Phil have over 
10 viewers 

[11:56] <bethelewd> wrath who knows 
[11:57] <bethelewd> NINTENDO IS NUDNIKS 

[11:57] <arcticsurface> Thats cause Okami is a work of art and plebs want to be seeing flashy shit 24 / 7 or else 
they lose interest. 

[11:57] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe don’t do it 
[11:57] <vooxxy> noo unleash the hate 

[11:57] <lastkryptonian94> @BeTheLewd Okami is fucking awesome. You must not have good taste. 

[11:57] <jbowler21> i agree leon. 

[11:57] <markrodriguez09> mine have been doing that since it started phil 

[11:57] <markrodriguez09> just claim it the moment it's demonetized 

[11:57] <musclesforbones> switch to something that lets you interact with chat more maybe 

[11:57] <drilbit777> okami is a good game but its always been niche 

[11:57] <bethelewd> i have good taste 

[11:57] <theycallmejimbob> WRONG BeTheLewd 

[11:57] <markrodriguez09> cause i shit you not, these videos I put up, not even 3 seconds go by and they're 

auto-demonetized 

[11:57] <bethelewd> correct 

[11:57] <gamemaster2003isdead> 5 dollars 

[11:58] <bromanreignz> phill you can get an extension for unpayed taxes. 

[11:58] <dutchstrudelz> I think it's 3000$ 

[11:58] <kaixp> Okami is niche, but it doesna€™t mean ita€™s bad. Just the wrong game for his Channel 
[11:58] <theycallmejimbob> probably going on their Christmas Holidays till the first week of January too 
dspHmm 

[11:58] <markrodriguez09> so Phil is right about the algorythym. noone is monitoring them, they just get 

auto-demonetized 

[11:58] <wxrxaxtxh> UMMM 

[11:58] <dicekano> aww lads he still snorts 

[11:58] <musclesforbones> throw it in the trash LUL 

[11:59] <vooxxy> lol

should've taken all of 4 sentences. 

[12:00] <jmon_1985> A 

[12:00] <theycallmejimbob> PlayerUnknown Hype VoHiYo 
[12:00] <musclesforbones> the people want you run for president 

[12:00] <arcticsurface> Its ok just dont completely drop the playthrough for the short attention span doods and 
keep it in the sides or downtime. 

[12:00] <wxrxaxtxh> damn rip @LastKryptonian94

out, so he played Spyro and 100%. He said he go back next year in compensation

@theycallmejimbob 

[12:40] <skooma_dealer> kek no 



[12:41] <sethl89> its dumb, you shouldn’t have to pay for ps plus and xbox, like its not like they host the servers 
form the games 

[12:41] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil This appears to be based on the Wii Version which had brighter, 
more colorful graphics, whereas the PS2 Version had a filter over everything to make it look more like a real 
painting on canvas. 

[12:41] <eternia_forever> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 

[12:41] <skooma_dealer> I havent played a mario game since super mario world 
[12:41] <bethelewd> jim cant afford it the price went up in September permanently

[12:46] <bethelewd> all my fave youtubers do twitch and youtube but stream more than post vids, like they post 
one vid a day but stream everyday for like 8 hours straight 

[12:46] <ondoher_> I used to watch you back when you first did a play through of Bioshock 

[12:46] <tantamounter> cheer 100 

[12:46] <eternia_forever> thanks jimbillybob 

[12:46] <skooma_dealer> dude backed up shit can make you super tired 

[12:47] <stratmanl909> tonsil stones tho 

[12:47] <seantorious> Actually it does work for them 

[12:47] <xtreemmasheen3k2> @DarksydePhil They also do it that way because the Youtube search Algorithm 
penalizes you for putting out more than 2 videos a day. 

[12:47] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil It's a shame this wasn’t ported to the Switch with Touch Screen 
support, the Celestial Brush obviously feels most natural that way, which was a big draw (pun intended) in 
Okamiden. 

[12:47] <teagrabber> I agree, and Twitch is a better platform than YT anyways

[12:53] <bethelewd> but he wont get rubies like me :P 

[12:53] <leonaras> The thing about raw playthroughs is they are pretty niche, and most people who are part of 
that niche want them without commentary. 

[12:53] <londorgael> lets be real, you did raw cause it was easier and quicker than just editing

[13:06] <bowlofbran> CiGrip 

[13:07] <gezoral999> he reads chat but a lot of non donations are bait 
[13:07] <brockhmpton> Is there a reason this is followers only 



[13:07] <bethelewd> you just go to a gambling place and sit on yo butt losing money :P 
[13:07] <kushiyakitori> a mod probably set it to followers and forgot to turn it out 
[13:07] <londorgael> how is the stream interactive if hes not interacting with the chat? 

[13:07] <majinboo3> They actually put in the real kanji lol 
[13:07] <londorgael> i mean lets be honest its pretty slow right now 

[13:07] <majinboo3> i feel like if you arent Japanese you wouldnt understand anything in this game 

[13:07] <hicredd> @Gezoral999 yis, plus people get banned for pitty reasons while paying users are allowed to 

troll the shit out of him 

[13:08] <hicredd> @londorgael he seems a little too salty today to host an interactive stream 

[13:09] <bowlofbran> PedoBear 

[13:10] * bethelewd plays fresh prince of bel air 

[13:11] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil Draw a line 

[13:11] <alanbaggiez> phil play some PUBG 

[13:11] <londorgael> wow interactivity 

[13:11] <hicredd> we rock kappa 

[13:11] <flyingdutchpie> @londorgael skoomadealer is the social catalyst in the community but phil timed him 

out. He rather tense these days 

[13:12] <wxrxaxtxh> LOL 

[13:12] <wxrxaxtxh> nobody is safe boiis 

[13:12] <bethelewd> phil is doomed 

[13:12] <bethelewd> awwww 

[13:12] <pablofortunata> why isn't he using the brush when they turn grey? 

[13:13] <marco0231> omg Residentsleeper kami wtf??? 

[13:13] <teagrabber> Thats a big nut Kappa 

[13:13] <marco0231> ResidentSleeper Residents leeper Residents leeper 

[13:13] <feignit> TriHard 

[13:13] <hicredd> the bear wants the nut 

[13:14] <kushiyakitori> @DarksydePhil I think its time to call an audible and switch games. Maybe at break and 
tweet a new game. Stream chat agrees 

[13:14] <londorgael> @KushiYakitori you have to donate for him to read that lol 
[13:14] <flyingdutchpie> @KushiYakitori maybe if you pay upfront 

[13:15] <teagrabber> @KushiYakitori why you gotta be hating on Okami Sure its not fun for everyone but some 
like it too 

[13:15] <bvalde09> did he acknowledge the 5 dollar tip? 

[13:15] <kushiyakitori> @londorgael eh, its not that important that I'm willing to use any bits 
[13:15] <kushiyakitori> @TeaGrabber its not hating, its just not a game that is getting attention, attendance is 
worse than a night stream and even chat is extremely slow, this isn't a game to play in the longer streams 
[13:16] <hicredd> he shouldn’t try to roll the nut up the mountain to the bear while being that salty. The game 
mechanic sucks a little. 

[13:16] <kushiyakitori> same thing people do with other nuts, bust it 
[13:16] <pinkdam> didn't phil say he didn’t want to be mr. views? 

[13:17] <londorgael> he did 

[13:17] <bethelewd> you crack it open and see all the sperm pour out calls its actually someones balls 
[13:17] <teagrabber> @KushiYakitori Oh okay, I just watch the YT videos normally so I dont have a feel for the 
attendance size 

[13:17] <r3conik> You have to bust the nut like you did on stream once Kappa 

[13:17] <londorgael> plant it in the water 

[13:17] <hicredd> I already see the nut falling down the edge 

[13:17] <bakedessert> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper 

[13:18] <donkyschlong69> its rolling down. NOOOOOOO 

[13:18] <flyingdutchpie> @Pinkdam he said something along the lines "project 7" 

[13:18] <teagrabber> Put it in the water with the glowing circle? 



[13:19] <niatana> quick someone give him bits and tell him 
[13:19] <donkyschlong69> too late 
[13:19] <londorgael> lol he saw your comment 
[13:19] <kushiyakitori> SnowLUL 

[13:19] <hicredd> he is rolling the nut the wrong way, there's another way up the hill 
[13:20] <pinkdam> like conker’s bad fur day innit

[13:20] <deltaphazon> Fix the kids line already 

[13:20] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil Roll the nut into the spring.

[13:54] <nightbot> Eternia Forever -> Please don’t post links, [warning] 

[13:54] <bethelewd> it has like a wifi bar with a hazard symbol undr it meaning your internet cant handle live 

streaming a game onto your ps4 

[13:54] <anomalyfs2> hello

[13:55] <jjbx22> @darksydephil add metal gear solid 1 to the goal

[13:56] <pr34ch> jjbx22 wich one do you consider to be mgsl?

[13:56] <jjbx22> let me get bits so he will respond Kappa 
[13:56] <bethelewd> but ps now is separate 

[13:56] <pwnage_101> Cool @Eternia_Forever. I hope the S8 is good.

[13:57] <jjbx22> the 2 free games suck 
[13:57] <jjbx22> 95% of the time 

[13:57] <reallybuffllama> @pwnage_101 not too bad, yourself? 

[13:57] <slowjoee> @jjbx22 thought i saw the ps4 circle

[14:45] <theelightninggod> If the mechanics of this game worked this boss fight would be easy. But since the 
mechanics are awful it cheats and ita€™s bullshit. Not hard just annoying. 

[14:46] <kushiyakitori> FUF 

[14:46] <deltaphazon> The prostitute spider is eating phil. Enjoy that imagery.

<shroomtastic> was this a patron choice 

<loboconfiavel> where's the khanstant subbing tipping and cheering 
<kozatof> Get better at the game dude 
<aragorio> Nice

<wouldyoulikesomeballz> at least nintenxlo 
<deltaphazon> Like game. Play game. 

<musclesforbones> just play something that's not awful 

<kinggoken> this will most likely be the last Okami stream 

<eternia_forever> comes out next month I do believe @theycallmejimbob 

<kozatof> Why do you even play games 

<wouldyoulikesomeballz> @kozatof SnowSing 

<sprank_n> tbh okami sucks 

<kozatof> dspHmm dspHinm 

<theelightninggod> Man this day is slow. Stupid Buggy Life mechanics I wanted this day to go fast but 

<kinggoken> this is a legendary game 
<shroomtastic> sounds like he's saying blackformers 
<shroomtastic> it's platformers, right 
<kinggoken> they really should make a true sequel for it 

<aragorio> A year ago he would finish the game but with hos current situation he cant 
<wouldyoulikesomeballz> Okami is a good game, but a game that won't save the house 
<eternia_forever> who told him to play this game ? 

<kozatof> Me 

<pinkdam> nah phil does complete game playthroughs he will finish okami 
<sprank_n> @Shroomtastic no its blackformers 

<kinggoken> to be honest....dsp should have played Xenoblade Chronicles 2 
<eternia_forever> sigh 
<deltaphazon> Okami is great. 

<kozatof> I said play the weeb shit 

<theycallmejimbob> someone donated the game to him too Eternia Forever 
<musclesforbones> weeb shit = doo doo city 
<loboconfiavel> save the house, hint hint 

<monkeydonkeyape> phil should make an adventure game "save my house and defeat the taxman" 
<futurehades> Good god not the music remixa€™s again 
<kozatof> Exactly 

<theelightninggod> This gaem is boring. Ia€™m not even mad Ia€™m just bored at this point 

<kozatof> Pubg is always good 

<deltaphazon> Better than most shooters you all play. 

<niatana> mm if he was more interested in the game it wouldnt be so boring 
<eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob must have been a distractor that donated it 
<royalfan> Howa€™s the gnar going 
<kozatof> 1 to switch to pubg 
<kozatof> 1 

<futurehades> @monkeydonkeyape lol 
<royalfan> Game 

<sprank_n> @Pinkdam i don't think so, just look at attendance and cheer/tips/etc this game is pretty 



much done 

[14:55] <aragorio> He should do a 24 hour donation marathon. 

[14:55] <niatana> he doesnt even ask questions about the plot or guess whats really going on 

[14:55] <shroomtastic> he was boring to watch pubg. did he get better at the game 

[14:55] <pinkdam> phil doesn't want to be mr. views 

[14:56] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Istreamstats 

[14:56] <nightbot> Stream stats: 30 fps, 271 viewers, 1080p resolution

[14:56] <kozatof> PRESS DSP FOR PUBG stream 
[14:56] <kozatof> Dsp 

[14:56] <theelightninggod> Hit 1 in the chat if Phil should replay an older game he once had a play through of 
instead of these boring ass games 

[14:56] <monkeydonkeyape> phil's laugh sounds like he's in pain

stream?

[14:58] <skooma_dealer> JOHN RAMBO 

[14:58] <kozatof> Is that the reason dsp stopped playing sims 

[14:58] <kinggoken> you guys better soak it all in. This will the last time he plays Okami. Bank on it. 

[14:59] <aragorio> Or a 10.000 dollar patreon goal where he releases a sex tape. That would save hos house 
[14:59] <kinggoken> this song is tight by the way 
[14:59] <baylesstheg0> RAMBO 
[14:59] <kozatof> RAMBO IS HERE

[15:00] <kekon3> muxy300 Okami is fun times man, hope you're enjoying, but if this don't work, I'd recommend 
going back to Nier Automata, actually. Lots of story and fun action moments 

[15:00] <verakor> why is phil asking for more donations cause he didnt pay tax on the money that was donated 
previously 

[15:01] <skooma_dealer> LUL
