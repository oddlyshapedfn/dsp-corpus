[19:34] <majinboo3> phil you think its possible to beat that last mission 

[19:35] <majinboo3> because honestly unless you drop money on a new car it might be impossible 

[19:37] <darksydephil> im buying a new car, theres no way to beat it with the audi 

[19:37] <darksydephil> that much is clear now 

[19:37] <jannedaarcl35> you got this phil 

[19:37] <jannedaarcl35> you got the need for speed 

[19:38] <darksydephil> now guys, remember to play with the new pet when the stream starts lol 
[19:39] <infamousecondson> is this for HZD? 

[19:39] <jannedaarcl35> how are we on the patreon goal, phil? 

[19:39] <takumibun> no remix? 

[19:39] <dominonova> Need for speed 

[19:39] <infamousecondson> btw the keyboard is kinda lagging again :( 

[19:39] <darksydephil> no I goofed, i just renamed the stream to need for speed 
[19:40] <popsicolo> No one tell BeThe but I gifted him a sub to my channel. popsicSmug 
[19:40] <takumibun> there we go Kappa 

[19:41] <infamousecondson> yeah, i think the pet makes my typing lag 

[19:41] <darksydephil> it could be, i dunno, its a beta 

[19:41] <pray4rock> hello hello 

[19:41] <darksydephil> testing 

[19:41] <popsicolo> That pet looks disgusting dspEw 

[19:41] <djrunol> @DarksydePhil do you already have any plans to play Danganronpa 3 or the spinoff called 

ultra despair girls? playing both right now and they are super fun 

[19:41] <darksydephil> ive played enough danganronpa for a long while, thanks 

[19:41] <infamousecondson> the pet is not lagging when i click on it tho, but it was before so i guess that's 
progress lol 

[19:41] <neji2011> Danganronpa 53 Kappa 
[19:42] <popsicolo> DANGANRONPA SourPls 
[19:42] <djrunol> too bad. but fair enough i guess 
[19:42] <neji2011> * 

[19:42] <popsicolo> Boone is my sub KappaPride 
[19:42] <kidmuscle321> ... 

[19:42] <popsicolo> Wait what NotLikeThis 

[19:42] <djrunol> although, danganronpa: ultra despair girls is a 3rd person shooter like game that describes 
what happened to the outside world, so nothing like the other ones 
[19:42] <jannedaarcl35> YESSS

[19:43] <popsicolo> Ibraziers 

[19:43] <nightbot> https://i.imgur.com/QxNppiD.jpg 

[19:43] <darksydephil> okay the Live Pet enabled lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> time to click that shit 

[19:43] <elipsion> I dont see a live pet o.o 

[19:43] <popsicolo> 4Head :gun: popsicSmug 

[19:43] <darksydephil> hes below the stream 

[19:43] <fuzzfuzzlOO> @darksydephil how u click it 

[19:43] <darksydephil> only if you're on the desktop website though 

[19:43] <infamousecondson> i am clicking as fast as i can lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> doesn’t work on mobile 

[19:43] <fuzzfuzzlOO> Ok nvm 

[19:43] <nextgenelite> Hi 

[19:44] <breath321> You can only click it once every 15 seconds no? 

[19:44] <breath321> Clicking as fast as possible doesn’t do much lmao 

[19:44] <pray4rock> just web browser, don’t think mobile or the app for consoles 

[19:44] <darksydephil> correct, unless you purchase a micro transaction 

[19:44] <suckasurprise> I'm gonna miss late night Need for Speed once Phil beats the game 

[19:44] <darksydephil> then you can unlock it and click it nonstop for like 5 minutes 

[19:44] <djrunol> what does this pet actually do? is there any purpose to it? 

[19:44] <fuzzfuzzlOO> @darksydephil you should schedule to play fortnite sometime 
[19:44] <infamousecondson> rip 

[19:44] <popsicolo> The pet should evolve into this emote > popsicSmug 
[19:44] <fuzzfuzzlOO> Ita€™s free and would bring in viewers 
[19:44] <darksydephil> is that a common emote pops? 

[19:45] <darksydephil> if so it actually might, it evolves into all of the common ones 
[19:45] <popsicolo> No it's me popsicSmug 

[19:45] <majinboo3> Luckily for phil DanganronpaV3 has nothing to do with the first 2 games pretty much so 

he can play it whenever 

[19:45] <thatanonybear> popsicSmug 

[19:45] <jannedaarcl35> Inagito 

[19:45] <nightbot> #HopeSeedPhil #NudeForNagito 

[19:45] <neji2011> Actually technically V3 does... 

[19:45] <neji2011> Or 53 Kappa 

[19:45] <popsicolo> I can't wait for BeThe to realize he has this emote now. 

[19:45] <suckasurprise> Popsicolo's face makes a surprisingly good twitch emote 

[19:45] <neospartanhesperos9> i thought need for speed playthrough already ended. I've skipped like two days of 

streaming and i comeback to this dspPepe 

[19:46] <elipsion> doesnt seem to really do anything 

[19:46] <pwnage_101> Hey guys I'm here

[19:47] <majinboo3> Well, this might be the end of the playthrough 

[19:47] <thatanonybear> fam means ohana 

[19:47] <breath321> Is this the COD ww2 song? Jebaited 



[19:47] <the_elusiveone45> MW2 

[19:47] <thatanonybear> ohana means nobody gets left behind 

[19:47] <majinboo3> if he cant beat the race with a new car then its ogre to say the least 

[19:48] <the_elusiveone45> this song is classic DSP 

[19:48] <popsicolo> and ohana means that we have a healer on our team. 

[19:48] <pwnage_101> I'm digging these remixes here 

[19:48] <infamousecondson> cod mw2 remix of him dying lol 

[19:48] <amisbro> ello room

[19:48] <popsicolo> Oh, ana. KappaHD 
[19:48] <breath321> Ice pawn, I die 

[19:48] <darksydephil> but yeah, its basically all of the common emotes, changing at every 5 levels 
[19:48] <popsicolo> This song is about the human condition. 

[19:48] <darksydephil> it ends at level 135 i think 

[19:48] <pwnage_101> A Lilo and Stitch reference. Very cool AnonyBear 
[19:48] <infamousecondson> i hope it is not that one meme

[19:49] <popsicolo> My favorite episode of Lilo and Stitch was when they encountered the experiment that 
teleported Lilo and Stitch back to 1941. 

[19:49] <enzio814> This remix and Going Back In Time are my favs

[19:51] <neospartanhesperos9> i use to love shitting on kids in COD. pissing them off and hearing their no lives 
crying about their kda was the best

interesting?

me saying all fighting games a bad cause I suck at them
