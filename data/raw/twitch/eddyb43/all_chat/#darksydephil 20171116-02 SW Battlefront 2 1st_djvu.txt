[20:40] <retrocerverus> dspHmm dspCowboy dspAngrydsp we are the phil triplets 

[20:40] <kekon3> oh shit 

[20:41] <dead_kinggamer> @DarksydePhil did you see ea statement about the microstrantions 

[20:41] <kekon3> he did 

[20:41] <dead_kinggamer> they took them out 

[20:41] <jacksmog> Only temporarily. 

[20:41] <huffysan> What will happen after two hours? 

[20:41] <everything0> they actually did something beside lowering the rewards? 

[20:41] <kekon3> so, they took out the purchases, but I don't think they changed any of the balancing 
[20:41] <trashlogic> Do a patreeon goal to get all the lootboxes in the game 

[20:41] <winderfiend764> Wonder if it'll be better than BattleFront 2's story.The other one of course. 

[20:42] <blk_mage_ctype> Yeah, they just axed microtransactions, nothing more. 

[20:42] <kittyspank> for now 

[20:42] <lickmybussy> EA "listens to feedback," but they apparently didn’t hear the feedback for all the other 
games that have microtransactions. 

[20:42] <spectra2424> @darksydephil took me around 5-6 hours 

[20:42] <popsicolo> @DarksydePhil I reuploaded the fanart if you ever decide to fix it. 

[20:42] <wwe20025_its_back> Exactly! 

[20:42] <jacksmog> They didn’t axe them. They temporarily removed them. They said in their statement they' 
going to put them back in. 




[20:42] <kittyspank> they are adding it later 
[20:42] <flyeaglesfly01> Whats up 

[20:43] <kekon3> It took the real ass Financial heads to sit EA down and tell them to "STOP WITH THE LOOT" 
[20:44] <a_lern> Yeah, temporarily get rid of them to entice the disillusioned, but put them back in once 
everyone has committed 

[20:44] <iconicchristian> @darksydephil are you getting Detroit for PS4 just curious 
[20:44] <alvaron003> I dont think you are correct 

[20:44] <kekon3> anyways, back to my lootbox based Overwatch. They just added a new Character!

[21:56] <g33krom> cheerlO I think you can roll w/ the 'O’ button 

[21:56] <butter_my_bread> it plays and looks quite bitching imo 

[21:56] <keithstephen2015> Does anyone think the Last Jedi movie will be any good? 

[21:56] <plizzat5> ya mobile is hopeless 

[21:57] <everythingO> and the arcade seems like the basic lOvlO from before too 
[21:57] <everythingO> just mp hype for now 
[21:57] <genuinelol> :( 

[21:57] <g33krom> Not really in my experience @Plizzat5 
[21:57] <taniaraven> Phil, When are you playing the Campaign? 

[21:57] <kozatof> 8k credits for a hero? 

[21:57] <fringerazadm> game is visually stunning when working :) I need more ram and a new vid card and hd :( 

[21:57] <kozatof> Lmaooooo 

[21:57] <plizzat5> I can't buy bits this sucks 

[21:57] <keithstephen2015> Is this the MP or the campaign? 

[21:57] <g33krom> for some heroes yes @kozatof 

[21:57] <butter_my_bread> u can do a boss ass roll and it helps in long range gun fights 

[21:57] <secretbossfight> more colored lasers than a rave in that hallway 
[21:57] <kushiyakitori> thats why you look around and flank people 

[21:58] <aisaidhello> If you pay attention to the mini map then you can tell but other than that... 

[21:58] <everythingO> he's playing the 40 player mp mode 
[21:58] <fringerazadm> wow 
[21:58] <neospartanhesperos9> wow 
[21:58] <genuinelol> holy 

[21:58] <g33krom> I think it depends on if that hero / villain was alive or in the that certain era or trilogy of 
movies 

[21:58] <butter_my_bread> even jump shotting works fairly well if you play cod or halo you'll pick it up quick 

[21:58] <g33krom> @kozatof 

[21:59] <concretecasket> anybody else buy la noire remastered 

[21:59] <fringerazadm> that was a total p2w kill he is thinking officer beats heavy lol 

[21:59] <12_btw_hahaha> Almost like your a human? 

[21:59] <everythingO> he would honestly have more fun playing this if he played heavy, as a shooter it's the 
same spamrny spamrny as every other game 
[21:59] <thesaltminez> Roll 

[21:59] <beatlesl2335> You're an officer not a tank, stay back 
[21:59] <kozatof> @concretecasket nah I already know how la noire ends 

[21:59] <secretbossfight> For real though this level's look reminds me of Dark Forces in a good way 

[21:59] <butter_my_bread> the ttk is in the middle closer between halo in cod 

[21:59] <playerxxl234> How Are You

[22:20] <n30sh4d0w> @kozatof I mean ... is there other ways that shooters do the subscription / 
microtransaction model besides what are called Loot boxes? 

[22:20] <cte900> this game has next level loot boxing, well, had, until EA pulled back a little. 

[22:21] <johny_alumni> Yooo

[22:22] <lumpythebored> Of course DSP buys Battlefront day one. 

[22:22] <convertedclone> Quake Champions does have lootboxes, but you can get all the content in game, and 
it's fairly reasonable 

[22:22] <cte900> before the readjustment there was that big thread going around that it would take 4500 hours to 



grind it all or pay $2100 instead, not sure how long things will take now after EA changed it after the backlash 
[22:22] <n30sh4d0w> so with the Empire of the Hand... what happened to Thrawn?

[22:33] <ratchefanl2> HEEHEEE 

[22:33] <n30sh4d0w> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 canon-wise the people who made the clones were not the 
smartest people.... and orginally the empire didn’t know what to do with them. So most of the first tech they had 
like these walkers were either prototypes or sacrifices. There is a reason why the 501st were succesfful... it took 
over 200-500 platoons of 10,000k clones before the empire figure out how to use them. 

[22:33] <kushiyakitori> enemies stay near it and will kill you quickly just like the vehicle itself

[22:39] <silvianraccoon> Alright It's DSP's Tries It Stream!!! :D 

[22:39] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam loot crates are worse in everyway than return to obj cmon B ruh 

[22:40] <yaylandsharks> heroes are a reward for being good at the game LUL 

[22:40] <ashfordian2015> Will Phil play la noire re release 

[22:40] <dime_captain> having skill helps getting heroes Kappa 

[22:40] <neospartanhesperos9> Boba Fett has a strong ass gun, DAMN 

[22:40] <aisaidhello> You can play as a hero if you stop sucking 

[22:40] <lastgambit> or a reward for not blowing your funds on wookies first 

[22:40] <hoboxl0> why’d you even give EA your money for this game after all their nonsense 

[22:40] <n30sh4d0w> how do the Rebells have clones!? #confused 

[22:40] <ashfordian2015> I heard they have removed all micros transactions 

[22:41] <12_btw_hahaha> She was able to wound kylo ren when she never weilded a lightsaber in her life, they 
made her gain force to fast. 

[22:41] <chalupaprince> @ashfordian2015 its mircotransactions and yes they disabled them 
[22:41] <fringerazadm> @hoboxl0 why you watchin it then haha 

[22:41] <pinkdam> no they aren't, I don't want lootcrates in the game but I can ignore them, shoddy games where 
you have a poxy timer shoved in your face when you go outside the hack programmer's imaginary boundary he 
couldn’t be bothered to put walls around and do proper level design I can’t ignore 
[22:41] <hoboxl0> 140 IQ grenade throw 

[22:42] <aisaidhello> Why do you look at chat so much if you aren’t going to respond to anything? 

[22:42] <silvianraccoon> You have to be as rich as Donald Trump to get heroes. But i'm not sure about Donald 
though lol :D 

[22:42] <n30sh4d0w> @12_btw_hahaha remember no spoilers about episode 8 man (you getting close) 

[22:42] <optionalsuperboss> phil buys the game so you dont have to 
[22:42] <danielswe> ChalupaPrince it's it's, not its :) 



[22:42] <12_btw_hahaha> @n30sh4d0w the hell are you talking about? I was talking about the fight scene in ep 
7 

[22:42] <dime_captain> dat accuracy Kreygasm 
[22:42] <aisaidhello> You did no damage because you missed 
[22:43] <dime_captain> but he almost did 
[22:43] <tashiboss> x 

[22:43] <novaenforcer> Interact with the chat then lol 

[22:43] <yaylandsharks> how is he still confused just attack red and defend blue 

[22:43] <n30sh4d0w> @12_btw_hahaha o.o; oh... I thought you mean in this game XD ... nvmind XD 

[22:43] <tashiboss> LMFA0004 

[22:43] <ashfordian2015> Whata€™s better? Run and gun or pray and spray. 

[22:43] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam you can also ignore those return to obj too but to say loot crates arent worse 
is cmonBruh 

[22:43] <lumpythebored> DSP makes the the Deathstar head bumping Stormtrooper look badass. 

[22:43] <adam_frostburn> Then stop dying phil 

[22:43] <g33krom> Hey, Chat did you guys hear that a new trilogy could happen after the 7-9 Star wars movies? 
[22:44] <furiouskirk6> We already know a new trilogy is happening 
[22:44] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn he cannot help it. its an fps ;) 

[22:44] <novaenforcer> @g33krom ita€™s already being written 
[22:44] <furiouskirk6> officially 

[22:44] <silvianraccoon> OMG did DSP said Donald Trump? I never expected Phil to read my comment lol 
[22:44] <neospartanhesperos9> phil, check your surroundings every once and a while, you cant just keep 
advancing not imagine an enemy couldn’t possibly be waiting around the corner. 

[22:44] <dime_captain> all of the years of video gaming culminating into some solid how to not to play 
battlefront 2 youtube vid soon 

[22:44] <neoelectric> you think disney would ever stop making them? 

[22:44] <12_btw_hahaha> @G33krom I dont see why not, they have all the content from the EU, some of which 

they are making canon 

[22:44] <neoelectric> it prints money 

[22:44] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w The game literally aims for him and he still can’t do it lul 
[22:45] <furiouskirk6> Just checking in. How is Phil liking the full game? 

[22:45] <neoelectric> it sucks 

[22:45] <pinkdam> no you can’t ignore it because the stupid game will kill you, far cry 3 had the stupid return to 
mission area in an OPEN WORLD game, what a joke, absolutely pathetic game "design" choice, yet it persists 
and proliferates, some goon must be teaching this crap at game design school 
[22:45] <lumpythebored> Bugged force mechanics. 

[22:45] <tashiboss> Dsp why not champ ? 

[22:45] <nilihanth> a grenade 

[22:45] <chalupaprince> @Danielswe its that not dat:) 

[22:45] <tashiboss> U are really good at that 

[22:45] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn thier is aim assist OoO? 

[22:45] <g33krom> The ELI was non-canon I thought, But I guess the writers are cherry picking what they want 
in there movies @12_btw_hahaha 
[22:45] <danielswe> Dat what? 

[22:45] <pedropatriciol991> does anyone get froze moments on this game ? 

[22:45] <12_btw_hahaha> @DarksydePhil you gonna play heroes vs villains? 

[22:45] <dime_captain> this is one giant linear path, "i have no idea whats happening" dsp 
[22:45] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn my theory is players have hacked aim assist already 
[22:46] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w All console shooters have some form of aim assist. It’d be rediculous 
without it 

[22:46] <tashiboss> Wish he had street fighter 

[22:46] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam a€oegame design schoola€D Tf lol 



[22:46] <concretecasket> cheer50 favorite star wars character? 

[22:46] <dime_captain> he almost got 10th place Kreygasm 
[22:46] <tashiboss> I wanna see him play but i know he deleted it 
[22:46] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn have you played planetside 2? 

[22:46] <spacemarine55> How many gambling boxes have you bought bro ? 

[22:46] <tashiboss> But don't know why 
[22:46] <neoelectric> bored yet? 

[22:46] <tashiboss> LMFAOOO!! 

[22:46] <butter_my_bread> Disney needs to make sure they dont over saturate thr market tho a Star Whores 

movie will cease to be special so there’s a fine line 
[22:46] <fringerazadm> cheers to that 
[22:46] <superslygaming> lol 
[22:46] <yaylandsharks> LUL 

[22:46] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam the action is around the obj, why would you want to be far away from the 
obj 

[22:46] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Did that not have aim assist? Cause that would be hilarious since it was 
a PC port 

[22:46] <sledgehammer_devl> SJW streamer 

[22:46] <pinkdam> well you tell me how it's proliferating when it's so utterly stupid and intellectually bereft, it's 
the simpleton’s tool to keep the player where they want, literally tell them to go there or you will make them die 
[22:46] <onemanlive> Laying Down the BANHammer 
[22:46] <superkricken> quick thoughts on the game so far? 

[22:47] <furiouskirk6> How's the game and hows Phil doing guys?? 

[22:47] <tashiboss> Dsp 
[22:47] <tashiboss> U ok? 

[22:47] <yaylandsharks> snowflake streamer LUL 
[22:47] <danielswe> A grill?! 

[22:47] <lastgambit> phil you have to aim tho 

[22:47] <12_btw_hahaha> "lets try heavy" see's black guy...doesnt want to play him anymore 
[22:47] <lastgambit> play heavy and spray 
[22:47] <aisaidhello> Phil using a sniper LUL 

[22:47] <g33krom> "Why are you looking at me like that? I know what I'm doing." 

[22:47] <ashfordian2015> Still on fence on this game 

[22:47] <silvianraccoon> If DSP is trying to get Vader though skill, I would say he’ll get it in the year 2020. :D 
[22:47] <pinkdam> as for why I’d want to be far away, that's my choice, if the game developer doesn't want me 
to go somewhere he should either not make that somewhere in the first place, give no reason to go there, or wall 
it off intelligently 

[22:47] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam why start the mission if you want to just run around?.lol 

[22:47] <fringerazadm> exit and requeue 

[22:48] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w planetside was good for a while, but damn did they drop the ball on 
support 

[22:48] <optionalsuperboss> wall hacks PogChamp 

[22:48] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam than why play games at all if your gonna do is roam and not play the game 
itself 

[22:48] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn it was a PS2 port and no... according to Maggie and Biscuit... there is 
only drop assist... 

[22:48] <ass_blastor> cheer 10 Some servers only have 3 maps in rotation, you'll need to find a new lobby 
[22:48] <fringerazadm> A & 

[22:48] <pinkdam> playing the game is whatever I want to do when I turn the game on, why make a game world 
if you don’t want to let the player explore it? 

[22:48] <mrdrpatric> Phil looks like a blob fish 
[22:48] <silvianraccoon> There you go. 




[22:48] <g33krom> cheerlO there are 11 maps on GA. 

[22:48] <tashiboss> Did u rage quit ? 

[22:49] <mediumfun> hows phil doing, any MVP's for my mvphil? 

[22:49] <convertedclone> They gotta herd you around to make sure people actually adhere to the objectives 
though. Especially when people love to troll and most modes just end up being a slightly different DM anyway 
[22:49] <tashiboss> Oh 

[22:49] <pinkdam> if you want a player to do X in your game, encourage him, if you literally have to say do X 
or die, you have completely failed at design 
[22:49] <tashiboss> Nvm 

[22:49] <lumpythebored> No ones buying Battlefront 2. That means it's a buyers market. 

[22:49] <toxaloxa> does anyone know if there are austrlian servers? 

[22:49] <mrdrpatric> Phil eat shit 
[22:49] <fringerazadm> hahahaha 

[22:49] <convertedclone> If you want an open multiplayer game play pc 
[22:49] <tashiboss> LMFAOOOOOO!!! 

[22:49] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w How could that be a PS2 port. Planetside 2 didn’t exist when the PS2 
wa around. It was build for PC first lul 

[22:49] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam so all youre gonna do is explore but not play the game 
[22:49] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam you can explore all of far cry 3.....just not while in a mission... 

[22:49] <fringerazadm> haha @ the server comment :P 
[22:49] <silvianraccoon> Great Amazing 

[22:49] <pinkdam> exploring the game world is playing the game 
[22:49] <mrdrpatric> Phil look like the kind of nigga to grunt when he sits 
[22:49] <convertedclone> I spawn, I diiiie 

[22:50] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam so once you discover every inch, then what 
[22:50] <tashiboss> LMFAOOOOO @Mrdrpatric 
[22:50] <mediumfun> ugh, chair 
[22:50] <g33krom> EOF 

[22:50] <superkricken> they should have just used the map voting system from battlefield 1 for this. 

[22:50] <pinkdam> once you die, then what? you're not making any sense 
[22:50] <tashiboss> FUF 

[22:50] <lumpythebored> Didn’t you just celebrate blowing up a tank with a grenade? 

[22:50] <novaenforcer> Pinkdam you make no sense lol 
[22:50] <g33krom> A 

[22:50] <mrdrpatric> Phils gonna lose his foot faster then his house because of all the shit he eats 

[22:50] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn oh... I thought PS2 port meant that it was ported TO PS2/PS3 not from 

it. FailFish Falcepahn . Sorry my bad. 

[22:50] <pinkdam> what have I said that doesn't make sense? 

[22:51] <silvianraccoon> They got thier characters "souped" up because of Skills and surroundings, DSP. 

[22:51] <ass_blastor> cheerlO Glad you’re in 3rd person so we can see the backflips from granades 
[22:51] <fringerazadm> equip improved thermal and cooldown reduction epics & bounty hunter card for 
increased point gain :) 

[22:51] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam youre not making sense, saying loot crates arent worse than return to obj 
[22:51] <tashiboss> Dsp u can’t expect people to not shoot u, what do u think they gonna do tickle you? 

[22:51] <kushiyakitori> i don’t think this is the best choice of class for you 
[22:51] <g33krom> Whew 

[22:51] <pinkdam> I can go wherever I want in skyrim with a quest active, but poorly made far cry 3 doesn't let 
me...because it's terrible 

[22:51] <novaenforcer> Youa€™re playing a free roam game. But you get mad when you start a mission and 
cana€™t free roam anymore.... thata€™s the point of free roam lmao 
[22:51] <silvianraccoon> Or best choice of anything 
[22:52] <mrdrpatric> You're life is a messy shit 




[22:52] <lumpythebored> I think the best class for DSP in kindergarten. 

[22:52] <mediumfun> dsp is focusing hard as hell and not talking to us chat, i hope hes getting mvp at least for it 
BibleThump 

[22:52] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Planetside 2 was PC first then console since Sony owned the company 
that made that game so playstation made sense. The fact that they didn’t even bother to put in aim assist when 
porting to consoles shows just how little they cared, damn thats like legit sad 
[22:52] <neospartanhesperos9> @Mrdrpatric cmonBruh 

[22:52] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam except far cry doesnt let you buy loot crates 
[22:52] <g33krom> My bad dude @Mrdrpatric I try to be a decent person 

[22:52] <pinkdam> if you don't want the player to go somewhere, either don’t put that somewhere into the game 
in the first place, or wall it off. don't insult the player by bossing them around in a game they paid for! 

[22:52] <optionalsuperboss> stormtrooper aim on a rebel 
[22:52] <aisaidhello> Phil getting MVP LUL good luck 
[22:52] <secretbossfight> Jebaited 
[22:52] <mrdrpatric> Ok 
[22:52] <fringerazadm> @g33krom :) 

[22:52] <neospartanhesperos9> aim assist is for bitches 
[22:52] <tashiboss> LMFAOO 
[22:52] <mrdrpatric> Phil please have my babies 
[22:52] <mediumfun> aim for the head LUL 

[22:52] <convertedclone> wtf, comparing a multiplayer objective shooter to skyrim? 

[22:52] <novaenforcer> Now youa€™re comparing Skyrim to Far cry 3. 2 completely different kinds of games 
[22:52] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam why cant you do that yourself? why does the developer need to do it for 
you? 

[22:53] <pinkdam> "skyrim with guns" 

[22:53] <tashiboss> Do u complain about everything 
[22:53] <silvianraccoon> Phil going MVP??? I'm all for that :D 

[22:53] <mediumfun> look at your chat for more than 1 keyword every 5 minutes maybe 
[22:53] <kushiyakitori> complaints about game design it the chat subject tonight 
[22:53] <fringerazadm> rim in an airplane? 

[22:53] <adam_frostburn> @TashiBoss He does unfortunately 

[22:53] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn as for the support... usually the development team is drop off a project 
pretty quickly after launch. Microtransactions are supposed to help keep them on longer (like at least a year) 
but.... SOE (Daybreak) dropped the development team literally in the next quarter (Q4) after the game's release. 
[22:53] <fringerazadm> :P 
[22:53] <tashiboss> LMFAOO!!! 

[22:53] <eldeadmariachi> Skyrim Jobs 

[22:53] <superslygaming> you cant dismiss the rest of the game just because your not allowed to explore 
everywhere, i cant turn off the course in a racing game and "explore" the city, doesnt mean the entire game sucks 
and has flawed design, its nit picky nonsense and most players dont have a problem with it. 

[22:53] <tashiboss> @Adam_Frostburn LMFAOOO right? 

[22:53] <mediumfun> MVP OR BUST 

[22:53] <g33krom> Leave the lobby @DarksydePhil plz 

[22:53] <sledgehammer_devl> best multiplayer game ever was WARHAWK 

[22:54] <mrdrpatric> Wow you're terrible 

[22:54] <novaenforcer> I think youa€™re trying it say you want Far Cry to have Quests like Skyrim 

[22:54] <onemanlive> Are we not allowed to talk in chat not like you talk to us unless were throwing bits or tips 

[22:54] <mediumfun> damn, didnt get MVP 

[22:54] <convertedclone> you lost 1 second after overtime started 

[22:54] <fringerazadm> Steve Skyrim Jobs 

[22:54] <novaenforcer> But it doesna€™t 

[22:54] <tashiboss> Hope i don't get banned for saying that 



[22:54] <novaenforcer> Thata€™s for Fallout 4 lol 
[22:54] <mrdrpatric> Embrace the hate phil 

[22:54] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Dude they killed the game with the hardcore change to 
microtransactions. Now they have all these crazy abilites that break the game 
[22:54] <leewanner> @DarksydePhil - You ever think about getting a dog or cat? 

[22:54] <tashiboss> Dsp 

[22:54] <12_btw_hahaha> heroes vs villains! 

[22:54] <mrdrpatric> Become Dark Phil 
[22:54] <convertedclone> phil is mvp in my eyes :) 

[22:54] <silvianraccoon> :D The difference is Skyrim does not have loot boxes 

[22:54] <pinkdam> you can’t turn off the course in a racing game because it's walled off, they didn’t bother 
putting a whole city with streets etc. into the game and then killing you every time you drive into it 
@superslygaming 

[22:54] <tashiboss> Please play another game 

[22:54] <kushiyakitori> quit out, grab some rewards from "career", and join a new game and try out heavy class 

@DarksydePhil 

[22:55] <g33krom> A 

[22:55] <silvianraccoon> and skyrim is open-world 

[22:55] <mediumfun> is playing this on console a cant afford to be a pc gamer kinda thing or what 
[22:55] <tashiboss> PLay street fighter 

[22:55] <novaenforcer> @darksydephil when you streamin SFV AE

[22:55] <novaenforcer> boongoNaysh 

[22:55] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn PogChamp really PS2 is still around? I have not played it in years 
after I got burned out in the first MLG rounds. My team got 7th, but I could not keep up with the gaming life and 
school XD 

[22:55] <g33krom> Wow, I just noticed the loading bar at the bottom 
[22:55] <solid_fantasy> You unlock maps in loot boxes 
[22:55] <kekon3> Moira is a lot of fun btw 

[22:55] <feerex27> Go play call of duty with the rest of them Whiny b 11 eh e s 
[22:55] <everythingO> streaming on PC is problematic for him 
[22:55] <everythingO> I think he said 

[22:55] <chalupaprince> but to say that return to obj is worse than loot crates is just dumb 
[22:55] <everythingO> or recording 

[22:55] <superslygaming> @pinkdam in far cry thats also only when ur on a mission you cant leave mission

[22:55] <pedropatriciol991> does the game firezze for you guys in game? 

[22:55] <mrdrpatric> Phil have you ever been in a fist fight? 

[22:55] <convertedclone> he’s got a potato pc sadly 
[22:56] <secretbossfight> Starfighter? 

[22:56] <novaenforcer> Pinkdam has to remember Far Cry is a Ubisoft game. So you doomed from the start 
[22:56] <secretbossfight> At least it wouldn’t be those maps lol 

[22:56] <neospartanhesperos9> @pedropatriciol991 me gusta tu nombre CoolStoryBob 
[22:56] <secretbossfight> oh at last 

[22:56] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn not suprised about microtransactions though... I remember one of my 
former team mates complaing about some kind of stems or nanite abilities that give aim and other stuff. 

[22:56] <beatlesl2335> go back to the fighters please 

[22:56] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w On PC people do still play it. But good luck being able to run it. I have 
a decent PC and it runs like crap 



[22:56] <neospartanhesperos9> NEW MAP 
[22:56] <neospartanhesperos9> PogChamp 

[22:56] <fringerazadm> @pedropatriciol991 makes me want to play on console vs pc :S ea answers 

[22:56] <novaenforcer> But after AC Origins you might be able to roam while having active quests in Far Cry 5 

[22:56] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn ah cool 

[22:56] <mediumfun> itd be crazy to see the quality on his stream if he used pc 
[22:56] <ashfordian2015> Hope this comes out on switch 
[22:56] <silvianraccoon> Oh god he's going space???? 

[22:56] <aisaidhello> Phil is gonna use the "It’s a new map I don’t know what I'm doing" excuse isn't he? 

[22:56] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Yea there's an ability that just lets you be slightly invisible, on like all 
classes, it's shit 

[22:57] <tashiboss> What's good with that sfv tho? 

[22:57] <zukyun> ! schedule 

[22:57] <nightbot> Nov. 16: Need For Speed Payback at 12:30pm PST! Then the premiere of Star Wars 
Battlefront 2 at 8:30pm PST! 

[22:57] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Game balance was thrown out the window for microtransactions 
[22:57] <superslygaming> lilyachty is live right now 

[22:57] <onemanlive> @ashfordian2015 I hope it does but it probably be waterdown plus I doubt EA would 
support Nintendo 

[22:57] <mediumfun> lets see if phil PTFO at all in this match 
[22:57] <silvianraccoon> :DAnother DSP Tries It video everybody 
[22:57] <tashiboss> LMFAOOO!! 

[22:57] <n30sh4d0w> AS FOR SKYRIM, I think Star Wars Battlefront: The Elder Scrolls edition would be a 
hilarious mod. 

[22:58] <tashiboss> PJSalt 

[22:58] <mrdrpatric> Who is hated more EA or Phil? 

[22:58] <silvianraccoon> Both 

[22:58] <fringerazadm> don't ise spec on this map :P 

[22:58] <adam_frostburn> @Mrdrpatric Don’t make me chose please 

[22:58] <convertedclone> i + spawn = diiiie 

[22:58] <tashiboss> LMFAOOOO DarksydePhil DEAD 

[22:58] <talionshadowl 138> that aim tho 

[22:58] <novaenforcer> @n30sh4d0w that was almost an actual game. Then EA took over FeelsBadMan 
[22:58] <fringerazadm> don't use spec 
[22:58] <neospartanhesperos9> WOW 

[22:58] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam now do you see that loot crates is worse than return to obj prompts 
[22:58] <tashiboss> I'm done! 

[22:58] <tashiboss> xD 

[22:58] <lumpythebored> Bugged luck mechanics 
[22:58] <kushiyakitori> close range sniper? 

[22:58] <g33krom> I don't know what "hated EA or Phil" is @Mrdrpatric 

[22:59] <lastgambit> If Phil dies its obviously fucking lag or shitty game mechanics, stupid game! 

[22:59] <mediumfun> lets ptfo as a sniper Keepo 
[22:59] <mrdrpatric> must be the buggy game mechanics 

[22:59] <cookiemonster414> phil is playing this game like its COD i think that's why he's dying so much. 
[22:59] <lumpythebored> I agree all maps should be hallways, 

[22:59] <kushiyakitori> yeah, the maps or open, you cant squat and hang out in one spot 

[22:59] <tashiboss> xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 

[22:59] <fringerazadm> go out in the woods with spec 

[22:59] <silvianraccoon> DSP Tries It video 

[22:59] <neospartanhesperos9> stop phil 

[22:59] <mk4eva> lmao 



[22:59] <lastgambit> Im calling PETA 

[22:59] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn LUL now all the rants from Higby after he left Daybreak make sense 
XD 

[22:59] <neospartanhesperos9> dont hurt animals 

[22:59] <convertedclone> but... why would you try to play it like classic battlefront 
[22:59] <danielswe> PETA! 

[22:59] <secretbossfight> telefragged 
[22:59] <psychomojo> LUL 

[22:59] <novaenforcer> @convertedclone exactly lol 
[22:59] <optionalsuperboss> tapir warthog moose hybrid 
[23:00] <everythingO> Why play a game like a classic that is not a classic 
[23:00] <tashiboss> Watching him complain all the times gets me moist 
[23:00] <everything0> Weird 

[23:00] <pinkdam> and take this rubbish game as example, think about all the multiplayer shooters that had 
maps, if you went past the map boundaries you might be killed, but you had the whole map to play in, now they 
want to put mission area bollocks bossing you around? screw you, how about making your map smaller 
[23:00] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Yea, games shit rip an amazing concept 
[23:00] <tashiboss> BrokeBack 

[23:00] <mrdrpatric> I WAS SHOOTING HIM COME ON 

[23:00] <nightbot> Mrdrpatric -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[23:00] <paddingtonbearl87> MingLee 
[23:00] <silvianraccoon> Wow 

[23:00] <lumpythebored> Says guy shooting people in back 
[23:00] <convertedclone> pinkdam goin in tonite 
[23:01] <legendarygod23> Noob 
[23:01] <mrdrpatric> must've been online tactics 
[23:01] <tashiboss> LOL 

[23:01] <lumpythebored> The side is certainly un sportsman like 

[23:01] <novaenforcer> Pinkdam wants every game to have PUBG size maps 

[23:01] <kushiyakitori> empire wookie 

[23:01] <fringerazadm> audio says rwbel scum hah 

[23:01] <neospartanhesperos9> Storm troopers hate wookies TheTarFu 

[23:01] <pinkdam> but the people making games think gamers are stupid and need to be led by the nose to where 
the game designer who knows better thinks they should go - or else! 

[23:01] <backwoods219> cry cry cry yeah man be an imperial wookie i wanna watch that 
[23:01] <frankenfunk> Skyrim is boring 
[23:01] <arnity> LOL 
[23:01] <eazybayke> LuL 

[23:01] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn I feel bad for Clegg. The creative director for SOE's H1Z1 game he 
was the lead designer for. (ArcClegg was the dude who fixed all the broken PS2 maps. You can see him lurking 
in twitch chat sometimes... btw) 

[23:01] <lumpythebored> You just shot him in the side! 

[23:01] <mrdrpatric> Dude! 

[23:01] <mediumfun> 5 galatic assaults in a row ive watched and i havent seen phil actually play the fucking 
objective BibleThump 
[23:01] <woogio> noob 

[23:01] <convertedclone> pinkdam be honest, are you sauced right now? 

[23:01] <fringerazadm> darkside wookie would be cool:) 

[23:01] <legendarygod23> Hahaha 

[23:01] <pinkdam> @NovaEnforcer no, I just think if a game has a map you should be able to go where you 
want in it without some popup appearing telling you to stop or else 
[23:01] <g33krom> I disagree @Frankenfunk 



[23:01] <kushiyakitori> use a DIFFERENT CLASS 
[23:01] <silvianraccoon> Does anybody missed Video Game Land? Lol 
[23:02] <mediumfun> theres a team death match mode @DarksydePhil 
[23:02] <n30sh4d0w> can we look at the K/D of the other team? 

[23:02] <mrdrpatric> This can't be real you can't be this bad 
[23:02] <novaenforcer> Pinkdam even Skyrim has boundaries 
[23:02] <eazybayke> these people p2w before the nerfs? LuL 

[23:02] <neospartanhesperos9> @Pinkdam may be because some people troll or might abuse certain weapons 
that might make the game harder for other players 
[23:02] <novaenforcer> Cut it out lol 

[23:02] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Ugh H1Z1 holy shit what a trainwreck 
[23:02] <tashiboss> Dsp vs lowtiergod 

[23:02] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam and you think thats worse than some player buying a lot of loot crates and 

being better than 

[23:02] <pray4rock> lol 

[23:02] <tashiboss> I wanna see it 

[23:02] <ratchefanl2> lol stupid 

[23:02] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn I know q-q 

[23:02] <ashfordian2015> Always check your 6 Phil 

[23:02] <pinkdam> yes, actual boundaries, not a bloody popup saying turn back or die from an area you can still 
enter 

[23:02] <zukyun> why does everyone have the improved themo detonator star card , was it a preorder bonus 

[23:02] <fringerazadm> rubbing is racing, shake & bake :P 

[23:02] <backwoods219> hahahahahahahahahaha 

[23:02] <kushiyakitori> that shoots LASERS 

[23:03] <tashiboss> Actually they would be partners 

[23:03] <backwoods219> dudes terrible 

[23:03] <convertedclone> PJSalt 

[23:03] <everything0> why is your entire team charging into enemy fire 
[23:03] <everything0> they’re like bots dude 
[23:03] <legendarygod23> Lmao 

[23:03] <silvianraccoon> Who is the complain champion LTG or DSP? 

[23:03] <ass_blastor> cheer 10 DSP is my guilty pleasure 
[23:03] <lumpythebored> They're something called lasers. 

[23:03] <mediumfun> difference between that guy with the handgun and phil, accuracy 
[23:03] <tashiboss> PJSalt PJSalt 

[23:03] <novaenforcer> Well you can die if you fall of the map but now you comparing a multiplayer based 
game to a single player only 

[23:03] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w I don’t feel sorry at all, they got lazy and PubG came in with better 

mechanics and gameplay. It's their loss 

[23:03] <fringerazadm> omg from the side KAPOW 

[23:03] <ratchefanl2> LOL 

[23:03] <silvianraccoon> lol 

[23:03] <backwoods219> the way you aim that challenge will never be done hahaha 
[23:03] <kushiyakitori> LUL 

[23:03] <pinkdam> I remember halo 3 had those mines that would kill you on the desert map, they were on the 
edge of the map as a boundary, not inside the map marking a mission area, when it came to the map proper you 
could go where you wanted 
[23:04] <arnity> Doesnt show deaths? 

[23:04] <fringerazadm> 2 kills is 1 better than my all time high 
[23:04] <drybonesusa> it does show deaths 
[23:04] <mrdrpatric> Unlike your channel 



[23:04] <convertedclone> but if you're playing DM you can go wherever you want, so wtf 
[23:04] <backwoods219> you play the same map twice once for imperials once for rebels 
[23:04] <usojin> @darksydephil crystals are currency you pay for with real money 
[23:04] <mediumfun> @DarksydePhil do you know how to ptfo 

[23:04] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam but halo 3 didnt have loot crates where some player had better gear cause 
they paid more 

[23:04] <backwoods219> its been 2 hrs figure it out already 

[23:04] <silvianraccoon> Aw come on guys. Phil knows this game better than anyone :D 
[23:04] <obltv> just joining, hows the game going so far everyone? 

[23:04] <novaenforcer> But there were still boundaries 
[23:05] <novaenforcer> @usojin cmon B ruh 
[23:05] <mrdrpatric> Come one Phil you're a pro player 
[23:05] <convertedclone> game’s a joke, it's all one big meme 
[23:05] <fringerazadm> switch gun to the 280 cfe or w/e it is 
[23:05] <usojin> @nova atpCarl 
[23:05] <mrdrpatric> Come on 

[23:05] <everything0> game seems like a updated version of battlefront 
[23:05] <kushiyakitori> ac280? 

[23:05] <tashiboss> @Mrdrpatric What he said 

[23:05] <everything0> with ea drama 

[23:05] <convertedclone> the justice league of shooters 

[23:05] <novaenforcer> KonCha 

[23:05] <n30sh4d0w> ok night guys 

[23:05] <n30sh4d0w> See you all o/ 

[23:05] <pinkdam> yeah boundaries made by people who knew better ways of making games than a popup 
saying don’t go this way or else, what a failure of imagination, you are making a world for people to play in and 
that's all you can think of? 

[23:05] <n30sh4d0w> @NovaEnforcer waves bye 
[23:05] <mediumfun> HES PTFO OMFG 
[23:05] <n30sh4d0w> @Adam_Frostburn good talking to you 
[23:06] <mrdrpatric> Let's go Phil!!!! 

[23:06] <adam_frostburn> @n30sh4d0w Likewise adios 

[23:06] <fringerazadm> I thought snake eyes and cobra commander were gonna pop out 
[23:06] <mrdrpatric> woooooooo 

[23:06] <mediumfun> first time in 6 galatic assaults he ptfo, we did it fam! 

[23:06] <mrdrpatric> Have my babies 
[23:06] <kushiyakitori> its not a one hit kill 
[23:06] <convertedclone> PJSalt 

[23:06] <novaenforcer> I dona€™t get why you would want to leave the mission area if youa€™re doing a 
mission lol 

[23:06] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam so you're saying thats worse than the developer giving people option to be 
better by buying loot crates 

[23:06] <kushiyakitori> it doesn't matter if you hit him once, you need multiple shots to land, and close up and 
head on isn't best for snipers 
[23:06] <mrdrpatric> That's my boy 

[23:06] <everything0> My dream is to see him play heavy before the stream ends 
[23:06] <everything0> And get like 5 kills in a row 

[23:06] <pinkdam> BTW I also remember multiplayer games where maps would change in size based on how 

many players were present, and they changed by areas being walled off, not stupid popups appearing 

[23:06] <g33krom> nice sarcasm @MediumFun 

[23:06] <usojin> Im gonna have to play skyrim now 

[23:06] <cookiemonster414> 2 much wine we need more PJSalt Kappa 



[23:06] <usojin> because people are talking about it so much 
[23:07] <mrdrpatric> Whys he always playing the girl 

5Yn”QYn”QYn”5Yn”5Yn”QYn”QYn”5Yn”5Yn”QYn”QYn”QYn”QYn” 

[23:07] <nightbot> Mrdrpatric -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. 

[23:07] <neospartanhesperos9> b-b=b-but, they're using laser weapons with minimal ammo, sh-sh-shouldn’t they 
insta die with one shot BabyRage 

[23:07] <loganmo> this guys been playing games for how long and he still sucks 

[23:07] <silvianraccoon> You know what DSP and EA had in common.making you ppl giving them money 

:D 

[23:07] <novaenforcer> I mean Battlfield pretty much has that. Dice makes huge maps 

[23:07] <despoiler57> the goddamn map shows the boundries. dont venture past the line and nothing will happen 
[23:07] <novaenforcer> @usojin ita€™s just one person Kappa 

[23:07] <fringerazadm> @pinkdam my old school favs are battlefield 1941 (or42?) & battlefield Vietnam 
[23:08] <convertedclone> rip @Silvianraccoon 

[23:08] <pinkdam> how about putting a wall there instead of being bossy? why make an area the player can go 
and then kill them for going there? what kind of moron would think that was good design? 

[23:08] <backwoods219> stop using sniper in close gun fights 

[23:08] <mediumfun> rip guy saying that phils been playing games for years and this is the outcome 
[23:08] <pray4rock> Pick heavy class on next death 
[23:08] <a_lern> what is that crawling around? 

[23:08] <fringerazadm> lmao 

[23:08] <g33krom> that is exactly what I was thinking @backwoods219 

[23:08] <brotherbeefus> There's different wildlife and stuff around on the maps 

[23:08] <despoiler57> what kind of moron crosses the line thats on the map 

[23:08] <novaenforcer> Why put a wall randomly? it sorta takes away from the map design 

[23:08] <ratchefanl2> 'Medium he was just timed out lol 

[23:09] <ratchefanl2> he wasnt banned 

[23:09] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[23:09] <backwoods219> damn all you do is cry cry cry 

[23:09] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[23:09] <kushiyakitori> look at the boundaries of the minimap 

[23:09] <zukyun> Ive been playing nioh and Ive noticed phil is way better than me at it... 

[23:09] <brotherbeefus> Phil there was literally a big red arrow pointing toward where you had to go 
[23:09] <kushiyakitori> they explained 

[23:09] <mediumfun> "what do you mean go back to objective mode {in galatic assault}" -dsp 2017 

[23:09] <neospartanhesperos9> @backwoods219 he has a legit point, wtf happened there 

[23:09] <novaenforcer> @zukyun glo yo ita€™s not that hard lol 

[23:09] <despoiler57> he crossed the map boundry 

[23:09] <mediumfun> literally be better off playing cod 

[23:09] <mrdrpatric> Come on Phil you're the world best player 

[23:09] <backwoods219> dude your trash delete game and go back to minecraft 

[23:09] <kushiyakitori> he died because he didn’t fall back, just like CoD @NeoSpartanHesperos9 

[23:10] <pinkdam> @NovaEnforcer why design a map with areas in it that you don't want players to go? why 

take the time to put something into your game you don't want anyone to go to? just make it scenery and not really 

there, don’t tease the player then insult them 

[23:10] <tashiboss> Hahahahahahahah 

[23:10] <brotherbeefus> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 When the map phase changes, different parts of the map open 
and close 

[23:10] <sledgehammer_devl> always the games's fault 
[23:10] <cookiemonster414> dat potato aim Kappa 
[23:10] <fringerazadm> phil needs a crate with portable step stool 
[23:10] <neospartanhesperos9> lmao, he was trying to fall back dude 




[23:10] <g33krom> true @KushiYakitori 

[23:10] <convertedclone> he didn’t he was the world's best player, he said he's one of the all around best players 

in the country 

[23:10] <fringerazadm> ; P 

[23:10] <brotherbeefus> There was straight up an arrow pointing where to go 
[23:10] <mrdrpatric> Eat his ass phil 

[23:10] <mediumfun> phil needed to get in on the pay to win crates so he could kill people in this game Kappa 
[23:10] <despoiler57> its for other game modes that use more of the map 

[23:10] <kushiyakitori> yeah, and he didn’t exit the range so he died, it shows the limit on the minimap 
@NeoSpartanHesperos9 

[23:10] <pray4rock> Stormtrooper syndrome aim 

[23:10] <neospartanhesperos9> i didn’t notice the boundary then, i thought phil ran far enough 
[23:11] <thesupervillain543> whats up guys hows he liking the game so far? 

[23:11] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam why would you want to go to that scenery? if ita€™s just scenery for the 

battle thata€™s gonna take place? Ita€™s just for atmosphere 

[23:11] <backwoods219> hahahahahahahahhaha trash 

[23:11] <sledgehammer_devl> LMAO 

[23:11] <despoiler57> kobe! 

[23:11] <optionalsuperboss> that was a pretty nice grenade toss tbh 

[23:11] <pinkdam> good map designers can make a map suitable for what they want to happen in it, and make 
natural walls and boundaries, only a complete hack makes a map too big then puts popups in front of the player 
threatening them for going in the "wrong" area of a map in a game they paid for and that you made accessible 
[23:11] <convertedclone> Phil praying for them one-shot headshots 
[23:11] <sledgehammer_devl> too much toxic damage 
[23:11] <backwoods219> what will he cry about next? 

[23:11] <fringerazadm> must have been a decoy head 

[23:11] <brotherbeefus> "This game has no headshot damage, so I'm gonna shoot once and not adapt to two 
tapping people with this sniper" Kappa 

[23:11] <mediumfun> will phil understand galactic assault objective gameplay this year Kappa 

[23:11] <kushiyakitori> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 he was like 10 steps away from being safe, right on the edge 

actually, he was close but just barely missed 

[23:11] <pinkdam> @NovaEnforcer if it's just scenery you CAN'T go there, why make a place the player can go 
then subsequently put an effect in to kill them for daring to? 

[23:12] <neospartanhesperos9> wow 

[23:12] <tashiboss> https://gyazo.com/47b028272ce876eef6987513246678f5 
[23:12] <nightbot> TashiBoss -> Please don’t post links, [warning] 

[23:12] <neospartanhesperos9> the whole squad 
[23:12] <mrdrpatric> Lmao 

[23:12] <fringerazadm> @pinkdam is this a repetition bot? 

[23:12] <thesupervillain543> @Pinkdam couldnt have said it any better myself 

[23:12] <mrdrpatric> Bots ain't shit nigga 

[23:12] <cedric_mp> Hey Phil, favourite class so far? 

[23:12] <mediumfun> this game must feel like algebra feels to me for @DarksydePhil 

[23:13] <neospartanhesperos9> Algebra is easy OpieOP 

[23:13] <thesupervillain543> Kappa 

[23:13] <mediumfun> i suck at it 

[23:13] <mrdrpatric> ResidentSleeper 

[23:13] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam for the atmosphere of the map. Why would yo want to go there instead of 

participating in the battle in which the game is intended specifically for that 

[23:13] <neospartanhesperos9> It’s just rules you need to practice 

[23:13] <arnity> Linear Algebra is not easy 

[23:13] <arnity> please 



[23:13] <chalupaprince> its super easy 

[23:13] <fringerazadm> glhf:) going to try and get my pc version working again :S 
[23:13] <neospartanhesperos9> i mean algebra in high school 

[23:13] <bbnumber9> Know what helps out with damage? Actually hitting the person. 

[23:13] <zukyun> is heroes vs villains available from the start in this or do you have to unlock it first? 

[23:13] <arnity> do you know what linear algebra is? Not that easy

[23:15] <mrdrpatric> Yes Phil (((they))) moved your cursor 
[23:15] <cte900> they moved his cursor? hacks by EA 

[23:15] <convertedclone> the game moved your control stick. Never heard that one tbh 
[23:15] <flyingsaucersarereal> Phil's just having fun. 

[23:15] <mediumfun> we about to have some every 10 minute chat interaction? 

[23:15] <beatlesl2335> Its not the games fault 

[23:15] <pinkdam> @NovaEnforcer why indeed? if a player wants to go somewhere you put in your game, let 
them, games are for the player to play, not to be led by the nose by a bossy game designer. I can’t imagine what 
kind of self important person would think they know so much better than any player possibly could that they put 
death popups in to make sure the player goes where they think is the right way. totally immersion breaking and 
utterly unnecessary 

[23:16] <neospartanhesperos9> CoolStoryBob 
[23:16] <everythingO> nice blog 
[23:16] <eldeadmariachi> Nice essay 
[23:16] <kushiyakitori> lol A 




[23:16] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[23:16] <dukaduka> This is just the first game FeelsBadMan watch out Destiny, NBA 2k, etc. 

[23:16] <mrdrpatric> why indeed? if a player wants to go somewhere you put in your game, let them, games are

[23:16] <kushiyakitori> LUL 

[23:16] <secretbossfight> NBA 2K is way way way worse than this game already! 

[23:16] <neospartanhesperos9> CoolStoryBob 

[23:16] <backwoods219> fall back simple command but its so confusing lmao 
[23:16] <pinkdam> nice blog 

[23:16] <g33krom> lol @MediumFun do you need ppl to give you attention 24/7 like the world revolves around 
you? 

[23:16] <everythingO> you should make a blog about stupid game mechanic designs and borders 
[23:16] <eldeadmariachi> Gah too much text 

[23:16] <convertedclone> "self important person," really? Pinkdam is the Alex Jones of complaining about maps 

[23:17] <kushiyakitori> A lol 

[23:17] <g33krom> tl;dr @Mrdrpatric 

[23:17] <neospartanhesperos9> He is Darth Maul 4Head 

[23:17] <mrdrpatric> Rip 

[23:17] <novaenforcer> @pinkdam well consoles cana€™t even possibly handle a map that big especially DICE 
games and they make games for both maybe if they made games specifically for PC then there would be PUBG 
sized maps and youa€™d be happy but we have consoles holding everything back tbh 
[23:17] <g33krom> right @NeoSpartanHesperos9 ? 

[23:17] <paddingtonbearl87> lmao 

[23:17] <paddingtonbearl87> wookie vs the WORLD 

[23:17] <12_btw_hahaha> Saves up all match for wookie....dies 1 minute into playing. 

[23:17] <paddingtonbearl87> xecP 

[23:17] <neospartanhesperos9> infltrator phil lol 

[23:17] <despoiler57> most players also want to head towards the game objective, not away from it and out of 
bounds 

[23:18] <mrdrpatric> Phil they were cheating it's the games fault 

[23:18] <novaenforcer> Then it would really be a€oeyou see that mountain, you can climb ita€0 Q 
[23:18] <g33krom> dude do not chase darth vadar 
[23:18] <novaenforcer> a€oeIt just worksa€D □ Keepo 
[23:18] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[23:18] <mediumfun> @G33krom i forgot to add that he was supposed to talk to me only, im just pointing out 
the lack of interaction 
[23:18] <mrdrpatric> Rekt 
[23:18] <g33krom> WTF 

[23:18] <backwoods219> uninstall game throw console out highest window 
[23:18] <paddingtonbearl87> xecREKT 

[23:18] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil fucking with some real shit damn 

[23:18] <paddingtonbearl87> OSsloth 

[23:19] <neospartanhesperos9> kylo and vader op 

[23:19] <butter_my_bread> markREKT markREKT markREKT 

[23:19] <mrdrpatric> Turn off game 

[23:19] <convertedclone> these phil moans Kreygasm 

[23:19] <pinkdam> any game designer who thinks where they want the player to go is so much more important 
than where the player might want to go that they put death popups in to shepherd the player (instead of subtle 
game design relying on psychology etc.) is a failure and yes, self important, he can't stand the thought of the 



player deviating from the arty farty script he dreamed up, or playing the game the "wrong" way 
[23:19] <beatlesl2335> Try the fighters again 

[23:19] <mediumfun> the rewards go to good players @DarksydePhil 
[23:19] <lumpythebored> It just means they're competent. 

[23:19] <chalupaprince> Pinkdam needs to play google maps, no edges and no prompt to return bac 

[23:19] <despoiler57> guy was just doing work 

[23:19] <backwoods219> your so retarted 

[23:19] <neospartanhesperos9> lol

[23:20] <mrdrpatric> Like you heavy set 

[23:20] <convertedclone> well, when you go from game to game every other day you're not gonna learn the 
maps tho. The Phil curse 

[23:20] <optionalsuperboss> star destroyer graveyard 
[23:20] <dawner808> Is this game worth? 

[23:20] <g33krom> cheerlO It is Jakku from the force awakens 

[23:20] <everything0> nah 

[23:20] <mrdrpatric> No 

[23:21] <convertedclone> never buy this 

[23:21] <novaenforcer> Game is worth 30 at a Black Friday sale 

[23:21] <novaenforcer> Not even 

[23:21] <mrdrpatric> EA sports in your ass 

[23:21] <everything0> get someone else to buy it for you

days early but the mass majority didn’t buy that n are just starting it this weekend 
[23:22] <eldeadmariachi> Lol 



[23:22] <pinkdam> imagine if the players were allowed to go where they want and get into organic firelights 
over actual objectives like taking the high ground or controlling a choke point etc. instead of following the lame 
script made by the developer 
[23:22] <mrdrpatric> 5Y~, 

[23:22] <everythingO> Yeah at the most you could beta this game with the ea access thing 

[23:23] <thesupervillain543> @Pinkdam facts 

[23:23] <everythingO> plenty of other games are worth that 

[23:23] <bbnumber9> Man, what an amazing concept. 

[23:23] <paddingtonbearl87> light em up MingLee 
[23:23] <novaenforcer> You mean like in Battlefield 
[23:23] <despoiler57> get over the map issue guy 
[23:23] <flyingsaucersarereal> whut?.... 

[23:23] <fixitnpost> they moved his cursor 
[23:23] <kushiyakitori> the battlefield shifts 
[23:23] <novaenforcer> Or ARMA 

[23:23] <mediumfun> if you look at your mini map, you ran out of bounds @DarksydePhil.... 

[23:23] <everythingO> they moved his character 

[23:23] <zukyun> has phil started the battlefront 2 campaign yet? 

[23:23] <flyingsaucersarereal> Phil's too smart! game is stupid 

[23:23] <kushiyakitori> that wasn't smart because you ran straight into multiple enemies 

[23:23] <mediumfun> theres a reason you cant just go spawn camp them 

[23:24] <novaenforcer> Wait 

[23:24] <kushiyakitori> dont walk into spawns 

[23:24] <sledgehammer_devl> wow havent seen ... 

[23:24] <plizzat5> twitch mobile blows 

[23:24] <novaenforcer> Didna€™t Phil say something about Rey not knowing shit in TFA? 

[23:24] <mediumfun> 3 hours of gameplay and we learning about out of bounds in mini map Kreygasm 
[23:24] <ass_blastor> cheer 10 EA doesn’t want people to spawn camp so this is what they did 
[23:24] <novaenforcer> Now he hasna€™t seen it? 

[23:24] <novaenforcer> cmonBruh 

[23:24] <thesupervillain543> what the fuck is even going on lol 

[23:24] <convertedclone> No Grevious as far as I know, but you can play the fan-favorite character, Bossk. You 
know Bossk, right? 

[23:24] <thesupervillain543> i dont know waht the fuck is happening 
[23:24] <mrdrpatric> Lmao

[23:25] <mediumfun> AAA 

[23:25] <kushiyakitori> its not always the same direction or else you wouldn’t be flanked on other maps, there 

are multiple ways to approach

[23:26] <dawner808> Gay 

[23:26] <novaenforcer> Let him go out of bounds so then everyone can get lost OSsloth 

[23:26] <zukyun> just imagine every time you go out of bounds it's a commander shooting you for going AWOL 
[23:26] <thesupervillain543> i dont think he cares tho 

[23:26] <paddingtonbearl87> see he would even suck his shlomg hes a nice guy 
[23:26] <kushiyakitori> why not try rolling? 

[23:26] <convertedclone> "I don’t think he cares" fake news 
[23:26] <kushiyakitori> or radar? 

[23:26] <minnowpause> Scuffed sleep schedule btw 
[23:26] <mediumfun> thats some old man reflexes coming in 

[23:26] <pinkdam> well crafted level boundaries > invisible walls > death warning popups, and that's a fact 
[23:26] <chalupaprince> @Pinkdam how is that worse than loot crates 

[23:26] <g33krom> cheerlO Remember to use the rl ability for your shields and crouch to minimize your hitbox 
[23:26] <holden_mcgroin9> phil sometimes its a simple outplay

players (even if it's a lame option)?
