[11:28] <darksydephil> hmm 

[11:28] <theycallmejimbob> What is a tsudere or yandere dspShock hey TheSmokingBrownie btw 
[11:28] <bethelewd> hey phil 

[11:28] <darksydephil> soooo sadly it doesn’t look like the Muxy tips bar actually works 

[11:28] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[11:28] <goldencolts> son of a bitch 

[11:28] <thesmokingbrownie> What? That sucks 

[11:28] <bethelewd> awww man 

[11:28] <darksydephil> no matter what date i set, it shows as over 10k in tips already received tdoay lol 
[11:28] <little_blake> oh well 

[11:28] <kozatof> @darksydephil cause tips are through PayPal or whatever right 
[11:28] <bethelewd> tsk 

[11:28] <kozatof> How can they track PayPal tips 

[11:29] <thesmokingbrownie> Hey Phil have you tried StreamLabs? (sorry if you've addressed this before) 

[11:29] <bethelewd> isnt there a different thing you could use just for one day to track tips for the fundraiser 
stream? 

[11:30] <kozatof> Tips arena€™t intertwined into twitch @darksydephil or am I thinking this wrong 
[11:30] <bethelewd> didnt phil use streamlabs and then switched 
[11:30] <bethelewd> dspHmm 



[11:30] <theycallmejimbob> don't people sometimes use a whiteboard or something to track tips on twitch or is 
that too basic dspHmm 

[11:31] <bongojoe89> brb getting some brownies 
[11:31] <bethelewd> a whiteboard lol 

[11:31] <theycallmejimbob> BeTheLewd did you accidentally mute kozatof 
[11:31] <kozatof> @darksydephil you should do 72 hour stream 

[11:31] <ubska> maybe we can just stream him getting tips and the tip jar can be the shape of his house, thatd be 
swell 

[11:31] <bethelewd> jim yes and skooma :( 

[11:31] <me_ree> don’t tips flash up on screen if they're a high enough limit? for only the fundraising stream, 
just have any tip given show up on screen, then someone else can do the legwork of adding them all together. 

Not a great solution, I know 

[11:32] <theycallmejimbob> I've seen streamers use whiteboards BeTheLewd dspPepe 

[11:32] <darksydephil> LOL this is hilarious, like its a "Feature" of muxy that they obviously never tested 

[11:32] <bell_end_noob> one question about the charity stream...will we have a number amount raised so far and 

the amount needed? and will you be including the amount already raised? starting it at 0$ raised would be 

dishonest 

[11:32] <kozatof> Darksydephil should put biggest d 

[11:32] <theycallmejimbob> couldn’t Nightbot be updated with the current tip total by one of the mods dspHmm 
[11:32] <kozatof> Biggest donator 

[11:32] <darksydephil> you set it to only show for five seconds and then fad away, yet it just reappears again, 
and it doesn't read the total properly at all 
[11:32] <darksydephil> what a mess 

[11:32] <kozatof> @darksydephil you could do a whiteboard of the biggest tips you got 

[11:32] <kozatof> Call them biggest dis 

[11:33] <thesmokingbrownie> Caveman tipping LUL 

[11:33] <carlos_psp> Are you hiring new mods? 

[11:33] <ubska> @kozatof Yeah but hed have to buy and board and pens and he has no money for that 
[11:33] <darksydephil> it looks like its just going to be a manual process 
[11:33] <goldencolts> ah yes the old whiteboards of caveman times 
[11:33] <carlos_psp> I’d like to help if possible 

[11:33] <bethelewd> jim that is too much work and i would miss some tips so i couldnt do it lol 

[11:33] <me_ree> i’ve watched streamers before who update in bottom corner their three biggest cheerers, only 

takes like 10 seconds 

[11:33] <solid_bat> how are them brownies phil? 

[11:33] <kozatof> Hinmin 

[11:33] <darksydephil> ill have to keep a running tally of tips and patreon pledges between PUBG matches

[11:34] <me_ree> i don’t get it 

[11:34] <bell_end_noob> will brownies become a banned word too? 

[11:34] <carlos_psp> ????? 

[11:34] <ubska> maybe buy a 60 inch screen and display them on that in the background, could sell the TV 
afterwards or take back for a refund?

[11:37] <darksydephil> theres nothing on my forums?? 

[11:37] <me_ree> i could explain the situation as I know it but I fear it won’t go down well, so I’ll just say the 
words ’fluffy bunny’ instead 

[11:37] <bethelewd> so apparently phil made brownies so now trolls joke about them like morons 
[11:37] <goldencolts> maybe brownies is a codeword for something 
[11:37] <kozatof> @darksydephil bro, jelsea your old mod. 

[11:37] <kingofhypocrisy> @Kekon3 But the detractors love that Tevin guy, they all can’t be racist

too Kappa 



[11:38] <bell_end_noob> your dms with jelsea leaked and now we know the rumors are all true 

[11:38] <bionich00t> Apparently the trolls think because Phil’s gf made brownies all the "gossip" is true 

[11:38] <gandroid> who is the mod that went to kiwifarms 

[11:38] <theycallmejimbob> have a snickers 

[11:38] <carlos_psp> anony, viking and jes 

[11:38] <kingofhypocrisy> @Kekon3 Kappa 

[11:38] <xenoleingod> its like you people never ate brownies at a bake sale or any your mom/grandma baked 
[11:38] <bethelewd> phil made brownies with his girlfriend on his Christmas time off remember he posted a pic 
on instagram that is what this troll shit is about 

[11:38] <kozatof> @darksydephil you told jelsea your gf made you brownies . 

[11:39] <me_ree> on the king of hate, in the off topic topic, a lot of talk has been in there last hour or two, vidar 
wants phil to go to police 
[11:39] <kozatof> There I go 

[11:39] <nexus20000> Phil just should admit the story, either that or it will be revealed anyway in some days lol 
Kappa 

[11:39] <ygrabskiyl998> Is there any proof that shows dsp is in tax trouble? Why are all of you believing it 
since phil showed no evidence 

[11:39] <carlos_psp> people, let's forget about this shit, everyday there is a new drama 

[11:39] <ubska> i dont give a fuck if she made him brownies lmao i hope they tasted good now stfu trolls 

[11:39] <lightkunl988> Wtf? All this because of brownies? Lmao 

[11:39] <bethelewd> agreed carlos 

[11:39] <sardarkh> My god, these people have time to waste 

[11:39] <carlos_psp> * the drama, @DarksydePhil waiting for the game to start!!! 

[11:39] <masterxeon2002> what time does stream start 

[11:39] <kozatof> @darksydephil you shoulda€™ve kept jelsea on a short leash 

[11:40] <thesmokingbrownie> I hope brownie isnt banned. My nickname has been brownie since I was 6 :D 
[11:40] <coffeemode> Phil, mind explaining why you don’t have a repayment plan for those back taxes? 

[11:40] <burnout26> I have no idea what this BrownieGate is about some type of new gamergate releating to 
brownies 

[11:40] <kozatof> dspPepe dspPepe 

[11:40] <kozatof> LUL LUL 

[11:40] <masterxeon2002> wtf is brownie gate? 

[11:40] <goldencolts> RudolphWhoa 

[11:40] <shadysands89> CAN SOMEONE explain brownie gate 
[11:40] <xenoleingod> a gate made of brownies 
[11:40] <xenoleingod> duh 

[11:40] <sofiarayne> What about his tax problems? People who donate to him is doing so because they have 

money to give I think anyway regardless if he was ever lying or not about it. People are okay with giving money 

to him just because they like his content 

[11:40] <sardarkh> Brownie is a keyword for oil drilling 

[11:40] <ubska> lol is browniegate a twitter trend or something too 

[11:40] <burnout26> yea xeno knows what is is about 

[11:40] <masterxeon2002> i dont get it 

[11:40] <bionich00t> Trolls think that because Phil said his gf made brownies it confirms other bs 
[11:40] <theycallmejimbob> BeTheLewd ? 

[11:41] <kingofhypocrisy> Detractors are saying Phil's entire diet is brownies. He eats nothing but brownies 
Kappa 

[11:41] <kozatof> @shadysands89 I guess Phila€™s gf made brownies and jelsea leaked it 
[11:41] <kushiyakitori> all this talk is making me want to get a box of little debbies 
[11:41] <thesmokingbrownie> Trump: We need to build a woll...Of brownies LUL 
[11:41] <paytheescortphil> Pay your escort Phil. Stop being a little bitch about it

[11:41] <paytheescortphil> Cucks 
[11:41] <ubska> ban him!!! 

[11:41] <burnout26> and ban 

[11:41] <me_ree> as far as I can tell this isn’t really a kiwi thing, more a case of a chat mod from here, of several 
years, trying to discredit the 'escort', however they ended up believing the escort, they done their own querying 
about it, trying to help Phil but ending up turning, that’s all I know 
[11:41] <kekon3> gottem Kappa 

[11:41] <theycallmejimbob> kozatof asked me to ask you would you give him a 2nd chance BeTheLewd

[11:42] <me_ree> @DarksydePhil your chat mod jelsea is convinced you did not. that's why they said they 
started believing the 'escort' 

[11:43] <azirphaeli> Comedy is happening, one way or the other 
[11:43] <kozatof> @darksydephil you still talk to jelsea? Why 

[11:43] <bethelewd> jim trolls about stupid brownies and hype for la noire mixed up in one :D 

[11:43] <bionich00t> All this drama from brownies lol 

[11:43] <pureo_nikku> lol when you find out tell me @theycallmejimbob 

[11:43] <ubska> there is no escort, god you guys beleive in santa too i bet 

[11:43] <kozatof> There is no good that comes from that 

[11:43] <ya_okayy> why is phil panicking 

[11:43] <theycallmejimbob> :D will do pureo nikku 

[11:43] <bionich00t> Phil is panicking? 

[11:43] <kozatof> @darksydephil your chat mod jelsea is saying another thing 

[11:43] <ubska> hes trying to fix his stream jar to pay for his house, hardly a panic 

[11:44] <firedrake82> i think its funny you guys think people think the escort is real LUL 



[11:44] <burnout26> a mod is prob gonna get derank 

[11:44] <azirphaeli> Jelsea went there to help you Phil, you might wanna chat with him and clear the air... 

[11:44] <masterxeon2002> jelseas in trouble? 

[11:44] <bethelewd> burnout huh? 

[11:44] <a_lern> enjoying Phil's LA Noire playthrough 
[11:44] <bionich00t> Who is Jelsea? 

[11:44] <bionich00t> I've never seen him here ever 

[11:44] <theycallmejimbob> you had a good run BeTheLewd 

[11:44] <kozatof> The old chat mod 

[11:44] <bethelewd> hoi up what did jelsea do 

[11:44] <me_ree> i don’t doubt they're a real escort but what i do have to wonder is whether their story is real, 
it's an account that's been on twitter longer than the tihydp videos, after all - it's not a new thing, i think they are 
who they say they are but their story, nothing confirmed. 

[11:44] <masterxeon2002> a mod 

[11:44] <a_lern> great game - and good to have DSP playing it 
[11:44] <ya_okayy> phil ???? 

[11:44] <goldencolts> theyve been here some times 

[11:44] <xenoleingod> admit it phil u had pot brownies with an escort 

[11:45] <bethelewd> jim cahman 

[11:45] <kozatof> Jelsea was the old guard 

[11:45] <thesmokingbrownie> cheerlO I hope brownies wont be banned. The brownie in my name comes from a 

sleep over when I was six and I ate twelve brownies :D 

[11:45] <bionich00t> The nose knows Phil! Those brownies were poisoned! 

[11:45] <masterxeon2002> pot brownies are legal in WA are they not 
[11:45] <lightkunl988> When will stream start? 

[11:45] <sofiarayne> Okay, well I'm confused now so I'm just going to wait for the stream to start:) LA Noire! 
[11:45] <bionich00t> What a dumb "scandal" 

[11:45] <burnout26> no idea light with this new drama happening hopefully soon 

[11:45] <darksydephil> there is no panic here, i was just trying to figure out wtf everyone was referencing, and 
as expected, it's incredibly stupid lol 

[11:45] <theycallmejimbob> it was due to start a while ago Lightkunl988 but Phil's reading up on something on 
the forums 

[11:45] <masterxeon2002> phil did nothing wrong BibleThump 
[11:45] <kozatof> @bionich00t not that man 

[11:46] <shadysands89> phil please can you let us know the story? true or not??? 

[11:46] <pureo_nikku> so I'm seeing this forum thing 

[11:46] <kozatof> @darksydephil talked to jelsea for some reason and jelsea told everyone 
[11:46] <darksydephil> i dont even know the real story 

[11:46] <firedrake82> wait why was xenoleingod timed out? he made a harmless joke and i had a bit of a giggle 
as a result 

[11:46] <darksydephil> i guess someone claimed an escort made me brownies 
[11:46] <thesmokingbrownie> These rumors are fucking stupid 

[11:46] <me_ree> all I know Phil is that you have a long-time mod who suddenly stopped believing in you over 
this. I dunno if you've talked to them or not about any of this 

[11:46] <kingofhypocrisy> The whole story doesn't make sense to me. Why would anyone fly in a escort from 

another continent when you can get one locally for much cheaper 

[11:46] <kozatof> @darksydephil bro your own chat mod is saying this 

[11:46] <thedoctor5437> isnt it against the rules for an escort to reveal who their client is???? 

[11:46] <azirphaeli> Sometimes you want that exotic pussy 

[11:46] <bell_end_noob> you need to read the mystery woman thread on kiwi farms for the full story and then 
you will understand 

[11:46] <pureo_nikku> they're calling people "sad", and yet there they are diagnosing everything and 



screenshoting chat lol 

[11:46] <somethingyer2> phil can u make a brownie tutorial 

[11:46] <masterxeon2002> thats so stupid lol 

[11:46] <pureo_nikku> talk about sad 

[11:46] <goldencolts> omg NotLikeThis 

[11:46] <ya_okayy> omg 

[11:46] <critical_for_d4ys> maybe cuz they think you had brownie with your gf and they think thats the escort 
@DarksydePhil 

[11:46] <critical_for_d4ys> pretty dumb 

[11:46] <lightkunl988> Escorts are for losers 

[11:47] <masterxeon2002> your detractors really are dumb :D 

[11:47] <bionich00t> unrelated but I want to see a poorly cooking with the king for brownies 
[11:47] <darksydephil> why would i read ANY thread on kiwifarms, ever? LOL 

[11:47] <me_ree> @pureo_nikku you talking about KGhaleon here? I see them screenshot stuff all the time from 
detractor sites 

[11:47] <bethelewd> phil you know that people say your gf is a escort so of course they would say one made you 
brownies too its fucking stupid 

[11:47] <bionich00t> Kiwi harms is only good for the Mayor of Cwcville 

[11:47] <highqualityramen> Hey Phil, BSV is saying you should sue me. Are you going to? 

[11:47] <bionich00t> And he barely does anything 
[11:47] <bionich00t> Sorry I mean she 
[11:47] <ya_okayy> phil did u text ur gf 

[11:47] <kozatof> @darksydephil the person leaking everything wasna€™t a nobody it was your chat mod 

[11:47] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[11:47] <sardarkh> Hidden detractors everywhere 

[11:47] <bell_end_noob> if your refuse to read it phil then no wonder you dont know what the reference is but 
trust me this looks very bad 

[11:47] <darksydephil> there is no leak, there is a DM convo from twitter about brownies, thats not a "leak" LOL 
[11:47] <shadysands89> Phil is friends with an escort is fine with me 
[11:47] <kozatof> Oh 

[11:47] <pureo_nikku> no the kiwifarms thing that was linked @me_ree 

[11:48] <firedrake82> DarksydePhil i dont mean to be rude or anything but the reason you would read one is so 

you understand what people are talking about, i get you dont actively seek stuff out but it would help if you at 

least took a quick look at things to try and understand what people are saying 

[11:48] <kozatof> So your gf did make you brownies then right @darksydephil 

[11:48] <kingofhypocrisy> what is kiwifarms? a site that sells fruit? Kappa 

[11:48] <pureo_nikku> just look at the person who is "Mystery Woman" lol it screams of idiocy 

[11:48] <critical_for_d4ys> @DarksydePhil just ignore those idiots 

[11:48] <bionich00t> All this over BROWNIES. They weren’t even weed brownies 

[11:48] <darksydephil> im almost positive i mentioned my GL making me brownies in here on a prestream, but i 

have no actual idea, someone would have to go watch all the prestreams haha 

[11:48] <goldencolts> sounds like a site for australian farmers 

[11:48] <gandroid> how long until @kozatof is banned 

[11:48] <highqualityramen> Kiwi Parms is a place for friends to get along. 

[11:48] <iradiumviking> If they wanted to know you where baking brownies they could have just seen your 
instagram post from the 10 of december @DarksydePhil 

[11:48] <ubska> if he bangs an escort i dont care, everyone gotta get laid, now chill out with brownie thing and 
l;ets start streaming 

[11:48] <me_ree> well jelsea obviously thought differently - they are basing it on the escort knew about the 
brownies, it wasn’t public information and you confirmed it for them, jelsea, in trying to discredit the 'escort', 
ended up believing the 'escort', that's the situation here 
[11:48] <kozatof> @bionich00t weed brownies are meh my man 



[11:48] <iradiumviking> phil made brownies. #exposed 
[11:48] <bionich00t> Oh there's an instagram post lol 
[11:49] <ya_okayy> phil pis 

[11:49] <lightkunl988> @KingOfHypocrisy I like Fruits KappaPride 
[11:49] <bionich00t> Well there goes the theory 

[11:49] <bethelewd> phil you mentioned it on twitter and posting a instagrm pic i remember that 

[11:49] <goldencolts> RudolphWhoa 

[11:49] <kozatof> @bionich00t just get some backwoods 

[11:49] <shadysands89> so he mentioned his gf made him brownies, and a girl on twitter said she is an escort 
who made him brownies?? 

[11:49] <kingofhypocrisy> @Lightkunl988 Kappa 

[11:49] <darksydephil> this could be the dumbest thing ever lol 

[11:49] <pureo_nikku> this has gotta be the stupidest one yet lol 

[11:49] <bell_end_noob> the mental gymnastics required to downplay this is astonishing 

[11:49] <theycallmejimbob> as RaccAttack would say forget about brownies stick to lean meats and leafy greens 
dspHmm 

[11:49] <darksydephil> Shadysands89 : thats pretty much it 
[11:49] <a_lern> Phil, do you still listen to Howard Stern? 

[11:49] <highqualityramen> Link to the instagram post with the brownies? 

[11:49] <ubska> lol haters getting exposed here and a mod will get banned for eating it all up lol, classic! 

[11:49] <shadysands89> alright @DarksydePhil 

[11:49] <bethelewd> i dont remember the pre streams because i dont really pay attention that much cause of the 
chat but anyway 

[11:50] <shadysands89> how do people know the escort is real though? it could be a troll? 

[11:50] <iradiumviking> https://www.instagram.eom/p/Begl8DVgWhe/ 

[11:50] <shadysands89> is there any proof? can i hire her??? 

[11:50] <bionich00t> People are DMing me on Twitch to say it's cookies and not brownies 
[11:50] <pureo_nikku> none at all @Shadysands89 
[11:50] <bethelewd> jim leafy greens? like pot? 

[11:50] <goldencolts> @iradiumviking RudolphWhoa RudolphWhoa 
[11:50] <me_ree> it's absolutely about brownies 

[11:50] <lightkunl988> @iradiumviking wasn’t that on the instagram cookies? Brownies look different 

[11:50] <highqualityramen> The escort is definitely a real woman and a real escort with a 4 year history in her 

work. 

[11:50] <kozatof> So who made brownies then 

[11:50] <iradiumviking> they are called brownie cookies It's the same thing 
[11:50] <highqualityramen> What's unknown is how true her story is. 

[11:50] <burnout26> that looks like some good looking brownies @iradiumviking 
[11:50] <highqualityramen> Though nothing has ever disproven it entirely. 

[11:50] <ya_okayy> phil get on prestream clear all this up ur panicking 
[11:50] <highqualityramen> or, at all, really. 

[11:50] <quertyaltt255> Viking, those are cookies dumbass. Haven't you ever seen brownies before? 

[11:50] <theycallmejimbob> :o like Brussels sprouts and cabbage BeTheLewd I thi nk that's what RaccAttack 
meant 

[11:50] <bethelewd> viking yes we know lol 
[11:50] <shadysands89> whats her name @HighQualityRamen 
[11:50] <kozatof> @iradiumviking that says cookies man not brownies 
[11:50] <ubska> lol why do so many people say "okay" on that insta post? 

[11:50] <firedrake82> hey guess what? easiest thing to do is look at the time things were said/posted and youll 
find out whats going on pretty quickly 

[11:50] <iradiumviking> if that isn’t brownies enough for you. I can’t help you morons. 

[11:50] <bethelewd> jim suuuure 



[11:50] <bionich00t> ... 

[11:50] <highqualityramen> It's on the KF you choose to seek that information out. 

[11:51] <shadysands89> okay fair enough 

[11:51] <bongojoe89> the brownies are real boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssss 
[11:51] <bethelewd> viking in with the insults at the trolls 

[11:51] <me_ree> I think Phil should take vidar's advice and go to the police, it has really escalated 
[11:51] <azirphaeli> Phil clearly described them as "cookies" 

[11:51] <darksydephil> all right, so now that i know whats going on, ill start the stream and i guess ill address it? 
its so dumb it doesn't matter and the people who "believe" wont bet swayed but i guess ill explain anyway 
[11:51] <bethelewd> you go viking 

[11:51] <kozatof> @iradiumviking theycallmedspThe cookies we baked are almost gone...guess we’ll have to 
hake something else tomorrow! 

[11:51] <goldencolts> sounds goodphil SeemsGood 
[11:51] <kozatof> Cookies dude 

[11:51] <pureo_nikku> if you just look at the person who is "Mystery Woman" you'll see how ridiculous it is lol 
@Shadysands89 

[11:51] <sofiarayne> Please do, because I’m confused about everything. Clueless 
[11:51] <shadysands89> hang on, why would the police care??? nothing illegal 
[11:51] <ya_okayy> im scared 
[11:51] <carlos_psp> dude 

[11:51] <bionich00t> They seem to be convinced the nose knows and the brownies will bring down DSP 
[11:51] <shadysands89> @pureo_nikku fair enough, i can't find the forum link tho :9 
[11:52] <kozatof> How are cookies brownies 
[11:52] <pureo_nikku> I'll pm if u want

[11:52] <azirphaeli> The same way escorts are tax collectors?

[11:52] <me_ree> cookies and brownies are two completely different snacks 
[11:52] <bethelewd> SIMPLE 

[11:52] <bell_end_noob> you have to have a almost religious level of faith to believe phil after this 
[11:52] <highqualityramen> lol 

[11:52] <iradiumviking> If what is pictured there isn’t brownie enough for you. I think you need to go elsewhere 
with your conspiracy theories. I will start banning you at least 
[11:52] <burnout26> block it 

[11:52] <bionich00t> We’re seriously getting into an argument over what constitutes a cookie or brownie

[11:55] <darksydephil> I’d mentioned brownies on a prestream or in stream chat, i’m sure of it 
[11:55] <iradiumviking> brownie coockies. It's the same thing 
[11:55] <sardarkh> All shitty prompts to wastetime

[11:56] <hollownetwork> Yeah brownies are completely different than cookies 
[11:56] <theycalhnejimbob> damn BionichOOt :D 
[11:56] <quertyaltt255> Vidar, just stop. 

[11:56] <me_ree> @DarksydePhil not according to jelsea, they seemed convinced you hadn’t, it's what made 
them stop believing :(

[11:57] <bionich00t> Delicious 
[11:57] <azirphaeli> It sounds like it 
[11:57] <kozatof> @azirphaeli combined two things 
[11:57] <goldencolts> a cookie made of brownies 

[11:57] <me_ree> i guess it's not hard to verify, if chat logs are all recorded just search for the word 'brownie' or 
something 

[11:57] <kingofhypocrisy> @BeTheLewd Hey, kozatof wants you to unmute him. 

[11:57] <amineo2> Brownies are Death Standing's final boss, I'm calling it

[11:58] <kozatof> I mean brownies are rectangular but those arena€™t ita€™s only sizes 
[11:58] <bongojoe89> brownies are hot and ready 

[11:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> Brownies is going to become a meme i see 

[11:58] <ubska> brownies are tasty either way 

[11:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> Huh 

[11:59] <jovayowolu> always gotta undercook brownies 

[11:59] <comfrtblynumb> My meatballs so spiceeeyeyee 

[11:59] <amisbro> pjsalt 1 pjsaltl pjsalt 1 pjsaltl pjsalt 1 pjsaltl pjsalt 1 pjsaltl pjsaltl pjsaltl pjsaltl pjsalt 1 
pjsalt 1 pjsaltl pjsaltl TGIF everyone and Here's for a good day of streaming Phil #charity 
[11:59] <azirphaeli> Right but then that wouldn't make it a brownie-cookie., it’d just make it a regular brownie 
that's round 

[11:59] <a_lern> Phil's right - bitches just don’t know. 

[11:59] <frogsonic> isn’t brownie mix like more runny than cookie dough? 

[11:59] <kushiyakitori> The actual difference for a brownie and cookie would be the density that would result 

from the use/absence of flour and how much butter is used 

[11:59] <barrbbot> All this talk about brownies are getting me hungry 

[11:59] <kozatof> @azirphaeli circular? 

[11:59] <azirphaeli> same thing 

[11:59] <theycalhnejimbob> I'm lost too TheNewFaceofCreation a few people came on saying they were hungry 

looking for receipes 

[11:59] <theycalhnejimbob> recipes* 

[11:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> Wau 
[11:59] <devkitgaming> cupcake are awesome 

[11:59] <darksydephil> actually the cookies i made WERE exactly like brownies on the inside, but they were 
still called cookies 

[11:59] <shadysands89> please don’t ban me i just want to know the truth 

[11:59] <amineo2> #BrowniesWorldOrder LUL 

[11:59] <ubska> Brownie = a small square of rich chocolate cake 

[11:59] <me_ree> cookies and brownies are two completely different snacks, but both are very good to eat. so 
good 

[12:00] <darksydephil> how about this 

[12:00] <jovayowolu> yeah and pretty easy to eat too 

[12:00] <kozatof> @darksydephil I dona€™t even like chocolate 

[12:00] <darksydephil> everybody relax 

[12:00] <bigbunga> feelstastyman 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ill actually talk about this stupidity in a sec here 
[12:00] <frogsonic> I just made some brownies 5Y’© 

[12:00] <sdruk> Americans calling everything cookies. I can see where the confusion comes from. Kappa 
[12:00] <darksydephil> just let me take a piss and we’ll start 

[12:00] <kekon3> you can bake the cookies to have a choco filling, thats how I do it 

[12:00] <azirphaeli> Is this really the route we’re taking: the M.Night Shamelan plot twist - "The brownies were 
the cookies the whole time!" 

[12:00] <kozatof> @darksydephil can you clear the air about this 

[12:00] <critical_for_d4ys> @DarksydePhil are you sure you want to talk about it phil 

[12:00] <shadysands89> okay @DarksydePhil thank you 

[12:00] <bethelewd> yeah calm down and lets move away from this 

[12:00] <pureo_nikku> We all know that brown thing is a biscuit @SDRUK Kappa 

[12:00] <lightkunl988> @iradiumviking to quote Phil on instagram: "theycallmedspWith the help of my 

girlfriend, I just baked these holiday-themed snowdusted cookies. YES, I JUST BAKED SOMETHING!"

[12:06] <sdruk> Hoping for a 75 minute prestream. 

[12:06] <me_ree> remember Phil, the situation: a chat mod attempted to discredit the 'escort' and ended up 
believing the escort, this was not helped by anyone else, was purely jelsea's actions. 

[12:06] <a_lern> Ad Vice 

[12:06] <muchiaskingoutvenezuelans> cheerl5 Hey Phil, howa€™s it going? My mothera€™s birthday is

[12:07] <idatedecadesyounger> @agoodrpg "blind" means he doesn't look stuff up while on stream, or try to 
read chat often. 

[12:07] <agoodrpg> Oh i thought it meant a first play 

[12:07] <musclesforbones> 20 hours isn't that long, it's only one more than 19

buy expensive shit when you're obviously hurting for money? 



[12:20] <firedrake82> the account is an escort that has been around for quite a long time now, just for the sake of 
argument if this escort thing isnt true then it just means the escorts account was hacked and she hasnt gotten it 
back

[12:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> Wau

[12:24] <scoopula> @Shadysands89 I don't doubt that a detractor has set up an elaborate ruse, they've done it 
before

[12:24] <jovayowolu> heh 

[12:24] <bionich00t> Kiwi Farms is a CWC fan site 
[12:24] <firedrake82> its a forum 

[12:24] <bionich00t> Mayor or CWC is a big fanbase there 
[12:25] <wlajuggernaut> taxes should have already been paid anyway 
[12:25] <memelordtz> fundraisers are typically made for the impoverished 
[12:25] <bionich00t> Mayor of CWC* 

[12:25] <megcatastrapphi> is it like 4chan? 

[12:25] <ornightz> Phil try not to get baited , these allegations are mearly trying to get a rise out of you , enough 
provocation would get you to react, just pay no mind to it and let it die out on it's own

[12:39] <me_ree> zero evidence? OK then, that’s fair. Is it wrong to ask for evidence of tax issues? I do not care 

about the escort, I care about a tax man saying they're gonna take your house away if you don’t pay up in 

January, it's really odd behaviour 

[12:39] <solidgearzero> that cringe cheer LUL

[12:40] <chairmancaleb> Seriously have to agree w/ Phil. Don't like him? Fine, but spending all your time on his 
life like this really is an unhealthy obsession. It's very weird. 

[12:40] <ornightz> idatedecadesyounger I gues Phil was 27 then huh , I guess it's kind of ok 
[12:40] <blue_blur64> @JinglingGamer They could just try to find out who it is based on the photo 
[12:40] <bethelewd> ven LUL 

[12:40] <idatedecadesyounger> @JinglingGamer , the escort accusing phil is part of a big escort network, very 
legit, she is just probably a troll escort if i had to guess. 

[12:40] <starlord_l 18> oh lord... 

[12:40] <jdcherdy> can't just fall back on them as the scapegoat anymore lol 

[12:40] <blue_blur64> @JinglingGamer They even tried to figure out who it is based on that backshot of her 
with the Christmas decorating 

[12:40] <ketanz40> woooooooooah leana is in 20s and phil is 35?????? 

[12:40] <i_came_here_to_something> People saying call the cops are getting delusional; that could lead to 
swatting. Some innocent dude just died from two COD idiots swatting. Doesn’t need to go that far.

[12:41] <theycallmejimbob> WRONG 

[12:41] <ornightz> Look the way I see it, Phil wasn’t in the ranmge of 50 when he was with Leanna 

[12:41] <zombiebeer> dont do that to her, they will ruin her 

[12:41] <sturbridges> Just say you guys broke up and keep her secret

[12:41] <goldencolts> wrong if true 
[12:41] <geotheo90> Was it worth the 3k Philly? 

[12:41] <megcatastrapphi> in my opinion its too fast, but i take things slow.... personal preference. 

[12:41] <superbatcat> i would still keep her out phil 
[12:41] <infinite_sphere> ok phil we get it. lets move on.... 

[12:41] <momomochi8> keep it private 

[12:41] <kingjezal> We know she exists. No doubts there. 

[12:41] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[12:41] <nolbert87> i kinda hope phil never mentions her name, or shows her face, it would piss those people off 
soooo much 

[12:41] <vendatus> dspSurpriseddsp 

[12:41] <sturbridges> These are horrible fucking people. Keep her the fuck out of that 
[12:41] <ggfunky> Shouldnt you keep your identity private? 

[12:41] <sturbridges> you don’t need to prove anything to them 
[12:41] <me_ree> I'm happy to be proven wrong.

me over the edge, so now I will reveal that your girlfriend is CLEARLY voice actress Kate Higgins, who took 
you up on the romantic proposition you made during your Mario Oddyssey playthrough! Don’t deny it! It's all to 
obvious now that I’ve gone completely insane with hatred, you brownie-eating Mother-fucker! #charity

also state how much the taxes owed are. No one would be able to spin it anymore that way. Just trying to help

concrete proof is just a stupid fucking thing to do. And so what if you had an escort? Why do these people care 
so much about your relationships and sex life? Quite disturbing.

[14:54] <trihard41iife> depression sucks, best of luck, find some positivity! 

[14:54] <ggfunky> What happens if you got no one to talk to? @DarksydePhil 

[14:54] <solid_fantasy> Is that really scripted , I remember getting 5 stars in every case with a guide 

[14:54] <skooma_dealer> negative does not equal depression 

[14:54] <channel33> i brought it up dude 

[14:54] <it_hurts_daddy> Check the twitter 

[14:54] <hidden_baiken> you need a companion 

[14:54] <skooma_dealer> depression is a medical condition 

[14:54] <lunar_rabs> that's actually good advice phil, good on ya

[14:55] <trihard41iife> therapy only works if you have something positive to add, else it doesn't do much 
[14:55] <kozatof> @kushiyakitori why did he get demoted ? 

[14:55] <channel33> just a CoD toughguy 
[14:55] <skooma_dealer> LUL

[14:55] <thebigtj 1337> it's part of the story kozatof 
[14:55] <kushiyakitori> @kozatof I asked too. idk 

[14:55] <shega_ace> i went to therapy after the death of my mother and 2 brothers in 1 year and after 6 months i 
saw massive improvement i felt like i didn’t need her anymore but she taught me valuable skills to cope 
[14:55] <kozatof> Yeh I know that but what did Cole do 

[14:55] <solid_fantasy> Working and writing film reviews help me loneliness as do these streams and you people 
[14:55] <pcgamehunter> Clinical depression has to be consistently present for at least a half a year. 

[14:55] <wjr02003> @darksydephil DLC time. This is the pre order DLC case from Gamestop that you never 
entered due to PSN being down. You also got the film reels for the badge challenge if you remember.

[14:56] <shega_ace> not to bring the mood down, but seeking help no matter how low you feel, always helps :) 
[14:56] <channel33> the swatting death was over a COD dispute, no streaming just 2 grown men threatening 
each other over a game resulting in a 3rd party being killed by police 
[14:57] <aiursrage2k> 60 more buckss 

[14:57] <solid_fantasy> Has Phil found a film reel? I needed a guide for every one

[16:28] <pcgamehunter> Two retards argued over CoD and one called a swat team to an address of some random 
person and got them killed .... 

[16:28] <dreamcatalog> this game harkens back to a simpler time when fully automatic weapons weren’t 
required to dispatch criminals, just a revolver and a nice hat 

[16:28] <pcgamehunter> @theycallmejimbob not really, I mostly just grabbed the free games on gog :P 
[16:28] <thatanonyraccoon> @pcgamehunter almost, neither of the two actually called in the SWAT 

[16:28] <butter_my_bread> it was over a cod scrim/wager match 

[16:28] <thatanonyraccoon> They fed an address to a third party who faked it
