[13:54] <kill4death03> @DarksydePhil your problem is pressing the break too much man 
[13:54] <segregate> drive fast and drift the corners 
[13:54] <kill4death03> @DarksydePhil just tap L2 

[13:54] <bjarne92> start spinout to ex. the right, and the hard counter drift to the opposite site 
[13:54] <theotherpoolboy> try spinning, thats a good trick 
[13:54] <katexo234> forced grinding WutFace WutFace 

[13:54] <doctorzzz> you gotta go fast and go ham on left stick to make the car break out. then countersteer and 
keep on the gas 

[13:54] <segregate> tap L2 and drive fast 

[13:54] <datruuf> Have you ever played the older Tony Hawk games? 

[13:54] <kejang> Nothing I could do LUL

[13:55] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil you cant drift on straight you drift corners only dont use the brake 

[13:55] <kittyspank> do it over and over till u get it 

[13:55] <supavitax> Tap the handbrake rather than foot brake 

[13:55] <adxmlikkleman> use handbrake 

[13:55] <datruuf> You just kind of press the e-brake and rock the left stick left and right 

[13:55] <korewasugoi> then why did you play this game in the first place 

[13:55] <drptolemy> when you turn dont be scare to push the gas 

[13:55] <encelor> dspAngrydsp sllverOMG dspNothing sllverPuk 

[13:55] <datruuf> @youngg904 Exactly 

[13:55] <bobbi_ling> lol 

[13:55] <kejang> Basic reading skills Phil FailFish 
[13:55] <kill4death03> lol 

[13:55] <ass_blastor> cheerlO Don’t try to drift, just drive and see how you do

[13:55] <trashlogic> Yeahh that is how it works gilipe 

[13:55] <bethemadeagle> kate well you need better cars to do story and to get better cars you grind so yes 
FORCED 

[13:55] <korewasugoi> i mean, thats pretty much it,... 

[13:55] <datruuf> Just press B or RB, whatever the e-rake is and rock the left stick left to right 
[13:55] <chaosalltheway> that's not dota 

[13:55] <youngg904> Counter steering turn your wheel the other dude 
[13:55] <superslygaming> its pretty obvious phil 

[13:55] <mr_darbus> People have been helping him for ages! That's the ONLY one he reads! NotLikeThis 



[13:55] <chairmancaleb> To be fair, I also wouldn’t get what that means as a non racer player. 

[13:55] <brotherbeefus> Bruh ham has been common slang for like, years at this point 
[13:56] <alexharveyconrad> LUL 

[13:56] <punk_dementia> Make the arse slide around the corner not the front. 

[13:56] <thatindieglo> Just look up a tutorial 
[13:56] <drptolemy> lol 

[13:56] <stunted> It worries me that Phil knows how to drive but doesn't understand the concept of drifting LUL 
[13:56] <bjarne92> YOU FINALLY DID IT. OVERSTEER FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER AND KEEP 
DOING IT!!! 

[13:56] <nightbot> bjarne92 -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[13:56] <segregate> tap L2 and use the stick to slightly adjust the car 

[13:56] <racerbest> you dont need to countersteer in this game 

[13:56] <aloofone> i think he wants to stop playing 

[13:56] <bobbi_ling> go ham on the korn 

[13:56] <epicpaladium> dont brake 

[13:56] <youngg904> Lmfao 

[13:56] <dantemustdiee> Ggwp 

[13:56] <encelor> street smarts aint helping phil out LUL 
[13:56] <korewasugoi> simply " TAP THE BREAKE" 

[13:56] <katexo234> poor Phil he's needs Han from Tokyo drift 

[13:56] <datruuf> But you have to turn off traction control if that's on, you're not going to drift if the game is 
forcing you to drive straight. 

[13:56] <supavitax> Tap handbrake rather than using foot brake 
[13:56] <superslygaming> double tap gas 

[13:56] <bigb_2718> You gotta brake and then hop, like in Mario Kart 

[13:56] <paddingtonbearl87> take the DISK OUT and throw it behind the sofa with scarface LUL 

[13:56] <atlastelamon9> Don't brake! Just before a turn, for a moment let go of the gas, steer hard in, now give 

gas! and counter steer 

[13:56] <kill4death03> TAP it phil 

[13:56] <superslygaming> on turns 

[13:56] <youngg904> Turn traction control off 

[13:56] <racerbest> @DarksydePhil just try driving as fast as you can without lifting off gas or hitting brakes, 
your car should start sliding 

[13:56] <jlawlar> watch the first cars movie with lighting mcqueen lol 
[13:56] <korewasugoi> TAP it instead of SLAMMING it 

[13:56] <bjarne92> You finally did it!! You started to drift to one side, and then started to countersteer and drift 
towards the other side 

[13:56] <divanerasmus> that is true he is telling the truth @DarksydePhil do this : try to drive coners as fast as 

possible with no breaks you will get it 

[13:56] <eckuk2> Don't go ham. Ham is haram. 

[13:56] <youngg904> Stop braking ! 

[13:56] <froztyblok> use you hand break to flick the rear of your car out then steer in opposite direction and 
accelerate just after tapping the hand break 
[13:57] <adxmlikkleman> NOT BRAKE 
[13:57] <datruuf> Turn off assists. 

[13:57] <dimitrius> turn off traction control 
[13:57] <datruuf> You have to turn off assists.

[16:18] <katastrophe> Merle haha :D 
[16:18] <lord_dink> thanks 

[16:18] <novaenforcer> @lord_dink not every EA game is made by DICE 

[16:18] <paddingtonbearl87> phils NOT impressed by marky mark and the funky bunches joke 

[16:18] <divanerasmus> i personally found this track really hard 

[16:19] <lord_dink> i meant the game engine all EA games seem to use now is Dice/Frostbite 
[16:19] <thatanonybear> I for one love marky mark and the funk bunches jokes 

[16:19] <lord_dink> i played bad company 2 on consoles and you'd always see frostbite engine at the start 
[16:19] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @lord_dink does frostbite run well on a 780ti? 



[16:19] <paddingtonbearl87> no one asked you InuyoFace 
[16:19] <novaenforcer> Bad company 2 is a DICE game 
[16:19] <merle_69> kattaSalt kattaSalt kattaSalt 
[16:19] <thatanonybear> tru paddington :( 

[16:19] <lord_dink> Yes it runs better than 970 and 1060 actually according to a few youtube videos for 

battlefield 1 comparisons 

[16:19] <5star_hentai> lol 

[16:20] <bobbi_ling> nice pic bear 

[16:20] <bobbi_ling> LUL 

[16:20] <lord_dink> frostbite engines though have weird lighting to them 

[16:20] <paddingtonbearl87> @thatanonybear k that was mean i retract my previous statement BabyRage 

[16:20] <lord_dink> these dark areas look like poop 

[16:20] <thatanonybear> nah it's all in good fun pad :P 

[16:21] <paddingtonbearl87> SeemsGood right on anony 

[16:21] <thatindieglo> Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

[16:21] <merle_69> kattaCool kattaCool kattaCool 

[16:21] <thatindieglo> Been there done that 

[16:22] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil all offroad ing is this way 

[16:22] <divanerasmus> lol 

[16:22] <lord_dink> @NovaEnforcer i'm saying Dice partnered with EA to license the graphics engine frostbite 
for and now most EA games are like frostbite and have same sort of look or movement. Even UFC1 and 2 on 
consoles i think are frostbite 

[16:22] <djrunol> can phil sell this car back for full price? if so, sell it and get an impreza wrx 
[16:22] <merle_69> trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl trihardl 
[16:22] <thatindieglo> Nope ita€™s less than half price 
[16:22] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> TriHard 

[16:22] <novaenforcer> @lord_dink theya€™re not theya€™re EA Ignite engine. UFC 3 and the newest sports 
games are frostbite 

[16:23] <djrunol> guess he is fucked then 

[16:23] <5star_hentai> probably scripted end where she lets you pass her 
[16:23] <thatanonybear> @Lord_Dink is that a good thing or a bad thing? 

[16:23] <paddingtonbearl87> anything on wheels is worse less than half once it leaves the showroom 
KappaClaus 

[16:23] <deepdrive3254> maybe its scripted till the end 
[16:23] <paddingtonbearl87> worth 

[16:23] <9mckenzie> You should try and get all 6 parts to be the same make/colour for a big bonus 

[16:23] <lord_dink> @ThatAnonyBear i guess it depends if you like the way the games look and feel on 

frostbite. I think they all seem to look similar and move similar
