[13:16] <cobaltclown> Hey guys trying to figure out what name is better Iceferatu or CobaltClown 
[13:16] <sprank_n> Bioware has pretty much been absorbed by EA at this point 

[13:16] <eternia_forever> yeah i ended up getting the mass effect game sealed new for like 10.02 $ plus tax ps4 
@theycallmejimbob 

[13:16] <takisq> thats the music they play when they make you wait in support calls Kappa @Kekon3 
[13:16] <encelor> only if bioware does kickstater a game without EA influince i’ll be back 
[13:16] <quantumquinn> I'm a SciFi nerd so I did enjoy the space travel in Andromeda but that's about it 
[13:16] <fl5664> @CobaltClown do you want to be associated with Ice Poseidon? 

[13:17] <takisq> how would they do that when they're owned by EA 
[13:17] <cobaltclown> No I dona€™t 
[13:17] <cobaltclown> So cobalt you think 
[13:17] <fl5664> @CobaltClown SeemsGood

[15:27] <superslygaming> that dude easily ate 50% of the zombies on his own 
[15:27] <popsicolo> Pretty much Kate 

[15:27] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, When they ignore you and act selfish in a team based mode, you've lost 
your chance for people to be nice to you. 

[15:27] <kushiyakitori> one run is probably still gonna take a while 
[15:27] <gorky22> broken drama mechanics 

[15:27] <bootytease> captain is a detractor and he was not good at it, and that hurt my feelings 



[15:27] <silkyenigma> SO WHAT was the POINT of AIRELORD insultting him if he is just going to leave 
[15:27] <dieterpet> WOW!

[15:27] <autismmaster69> he knows he sucks 
[15:27] <roeygabay> Fk your good LOL 

[15:28] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, You also don’t know if it was a legitimate "supporter" like you claim. 
Detractors getting in Phil's party happens all the time. 

[15:28] <popsicolo> It doesn’t matter how many zombies he killed. He couldn’t be bothered to revive his 
teammates. 

[15:28] <kinggoken> so captain isn't even in the chat? 

[15:28] <fruez> Captain speak in the chat please 

[15:28] <wxrxaxtxh> Captain was the best player lol 

[15:28] <kushiyakitori> does the game scale for just 3 people? 

[15:28] <fruez> I am your knight 
[15:28] <encelor> @Kinggoken he GTAB LUL 
[15:28] <kinggoken> lmao @encelor 
[15:28] <devihneycryl23> Could I join you? 

[15:28] <superslygaming> captain left chat 

[15:28] <silkyenigma> Airelord insults the best player, gets him kicked, now doesn’t want to deal with Phil alone 

[15:28] <kinggoken> yo @DarksydePhil someone wants to join you 

[15:28] <threedog64> Captain wasn’t the best, he couldn’t die 

[15:28] <hobbsl017> hes right that was boring 

[15:28] <themaskmann> don't worry about the stream 

[15:28] <fruez> Captain was such a god he couldn’t die 

[15:28] <epicun> It would have been usefull to have captain pulling and killing a lot of zombies 

[15:28] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb well for starters he didn’t do anything a detractors does all he did was stay 

in a glitch spot so how does that make you a detractor? 

[15:28] <encelor> yeah it was boring 

[15:28] <autismmaster69> He wanted to carry your ass lol 

[15:28] <encelor> but the salt was funny 

[15:29] <wxrxaxtxh> they did Captain wrong 

[15:29] <kinggoken> Yo captain speak up in da chat 

[15:29] <elena_arboria> airelord should now be co-op partner for Phil in every co-op from now on...I bet it 
would be hilarious to watch :D 

[15:29] <fruez> "If you're not entertaining the stream, get out" pretty much LUL 

[15:29] <autismmaster69> So basically you wanted to strong arm him into doing what you want to do 

[15:29] <superslygaming> ur right, he was trying to overshadow u and steal the show 

[15:29] <roeygabay> -1 sub from him lol 

[15:29] <blackpinkpro> Please suppress thy ego 

[15:29] <brahski20> Fiill farm points by shooting the zombies in the leg 

[15:29] <autismmaster69> sorry i bought this game with 60 bucks im doing what you want me to do 

[15:29] <bradmasonl993> I'm sorry but if you refuse to play as a team in a team game, then you deserve to get 

kicked 

[15:29] <themaskmann> your not the leader shut up 
[15:29] <autismmaster69> unless your paying me 

[15:29] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n. That wasn’t even the main point, you're straw manning something that 
wasn’t the main topic in the first place. He ignored Phil and his team, he doesn’t deserve respect. Case and point. 
[15:29] <sirnoblex> @Kinggoken He will probably never watch Phil after being roasted. 

[15:29] <superslygaming> captain is worse than harvey weinstein 
[15:29] <kinggoken> is @AutismMaster69 that captain guy? 



[15:29] <autismmaster69> Who cares he has no obligation to follow phils orders 

[15:29] <wxrxaxtxh> @ChairmanCaleb i dont think he ignored, he said something about getting to the next round 
[15:29] <autismmaster69> phill isnt the leader 

[15:29] <themaskmann> you haven’t been alive long enough to lead me 
[15:29] <kinggoken> you are probably right lol @SirNobleX 

[15:30] <brahski20> @Sprank_N I like captain. He made fill's stream good by trigger teh autism guy 
[15:30] <silkyenigma> Fill baerely knows how to play. 

[15:30] <theycallmejimbob> EterniaForever did Phil reply to your cheer 

[15:30] <chairmancaleb> @wxrxaxtxh, They said stop, that's not helping. He continues to do so. that's ignoring, 
is it not? 

[15:30] <popsicolo> He has no obligation to not get kicked out for not listening either. 

[15:30] <encelor> dunno the triggered salty dood when to far with the insults tbh 

[15:30] <wxrxaxtxh> @ChairmanCaleb but he had a reason to do what he was doing, it's not like he was AFK 
[15:30] <encelor> LUL 

[15:30] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb I'm not straw manning anything i just answered you're question 

smh....however all i was saying was that you don’t insult people that take type to support your content and donate 

to you 

[15:30] <sprank_n> your* 

[15:30] <chairmancaleb> @wxrxaxtxh, Is that the point? He ignored, something you tried to argue. 

[15:31] <themaskmann> thats the evil spirit within 
[15:31] <katexo234> so much craziness in the chat LUL 

[15:31] <autismmaster69> the thing is they had an easy scapegoat to put the blame on now that captain aint there 
who they going to blame when shit goes south? 

[15:31] <themaskmann> just listen to this guy 
[15:31] <kinggoken> todays chat is on point lrnao 

[15:31] <fruez> I think DSP should play with people who aren’t a sodium factory 

[15:31] <roeygabay> I bet you if they asked nicely and tel him he would get kicked if he did that again he would 
play with them 

[15:31] <brahski20> Holy shit. You guys see the bat lagged glitch that happened to fill???? I can't believe that 
shit always happens. He is cursed 

[15:31] <everything0> Yeah, his reason was to make excuses about wanting to rack up points and not help the 
team 

[15:31] <themaskmann> who raised this guy 
[15:31] <theycallmejimbob> katexo234 MindManners 

[15:31] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, And you also don’t act selfishly in a party that's telling you to stop. He 
does not have the moral high ground. 

[15:31] <kushiyakitori> @AutismMaster69 kekon and phil will probably still get downed like before I think 
[15:31] <katexo234> TPFufun 

[15:31] <encelor> i thi nk even mods are confused LUL 

[15:31] <popsicolo> I guess this is our controversy of the week. popsicAKES 

[15:31] <autismmaster69> Airelord might ragequit lol 

[15:31] <kinggoken> I should have joined @DarksydePhil I have this game lmao 
[15:31] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb neither did fill thats all i'm saying 
[15:32] <brahski20> @Kinggoken It's darksydefill 
[15:32] <encelor> DSF 
[15:32] <encelor> LUL 

[15:32] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, No one was claiming he did? You're advocating that he's the victim here, 
and he's clearly not. 

[15:32] <brahski20> DSF tries it 

[15:32] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, And don’t try and deny that you are, you've been doing so this whole time. 
[15:32] <encelor> geez this chat today LUL 

[15:32] <theycallmejimbob> kekon sharing his jolts what a guy BibleThump 



[15:33] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb no i’m not i'm just saying that you don’t treat supporter the way he treated 
captain how am i making him the victim? 

[15:33] <themaskmann> share points 

[15:33] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, Lol, exactly. 

[15:33] <bootytease> kekon is a good guy 

[15:33] <vendatus> if bethe was here chat’d be worse Kappa LUL 
[15:33] <wxrxaxtxh> Captain whispered me 
[15:33] <fruez> :o 

[15:33] <fruez> what did the god say? 

[15:33] <bootytease> captain whispered me too hes a nerd 

[15:33] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb all i’m saying is that they were both wrong but the insults were 
unnecessary 

[15:34] <theycallmejimbob> someone messaged me about a discord but dunno if that's captain dspHmm 
[15:34] <wxrxaxtxh> @ChairmanCaleb Captain told me that he was insulted, and it wasn’t deserved 
[15:34] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, Did Phil insult him? 

[15:34] <fruez> Yes 

[15:34] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb Yes 

[15:34] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, Mmk, what did he say? 

[15:34] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb Multiple times 

[15:34] <bootytease> captain told me he recored everything and hes uploading it 
[15:34] <brahski20> Captain what was your favorite thing about being in a party wtih fill? 

[15:35] <kinggoken> why doesn’t captain just speak in the chat?? 

[15:35] <sirnoblex> Phil didn’t insult him, Phil was pointing out the facts. 

[15:35] <vendatus> omg someone insulted me on the internet BabyRage 

[15:35] <wxrxaxtxh> Hey @DarksydePhil, Captain whispered me saying he wants to talk to you. 

[15:35] <kinggoken> i think captain is long gone. Probably unsubbed DSP as well lmao 

[15:35] <brahski20> @SirNobleX *Fill 

[15:35] <themaskmann> being a asswhole has never been cool 

[15:36] <silkyenigma> Captain explain your side on a detractor podcast. 

[15:36] <vendatus> LUL 

[15:36] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, if your definition of "insulting" is pointing out something that's not 
helping, then you have a peculiar view on how stuff works. I won't deny that the other guy insulted him, but Phil 
was very light on the guy. 

[15:36] <fruez> I love watching a cyberbully stream Kappa 
[15:36] <cookiemonster414> wait is that david tennant.. 

[15:36] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb it's like me telling you to do something and you don’t do it and i start 
calling you an idiot, with a mic up his ass who sucks at life 
[15:36] <themaskmann> I correct bad guys for a living 

[15:36] <zangba> Captain told me he's honestly probably one of the overall best gamers in the country. 

[15:36] <bootytease> he told his detractor youtube lol what a pleb 

[15:36] <brahski20> You guys see the melee lagged glitch? Fill man why is the game always against you? 
[15:36] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, Urn, that wasn’t Phil...? 

[15:36] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Captain KonCha 
[15:36] <kinggoken> lol a cyberbully. No one got bullied 
[15:36] <wxrxaxtxh> @Fruez He is upset 
[15:36] <papalouthefirst> dsp's home? 

[15:37] <superslygaming> what round we betting on? 

[15:37] <brahski20> @Kinggoken Yea captain did by teh angry autist guy in fill's party 

[15:37] <jii_el> when on ahead and bought this game lol 

[15:37] <katexo234> HappyJack AngryJack 

[15:37] <vendatus> I’ll bully you Goken like Jimmy Kappa 

[15:37] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb oh fill did plenty of insulting maybe you werent paying attention, but hey 



you can look at the vod once the stream is over 
[15:37] <kinggoken> oh lol @Brahski20 
[15:37] <bos2161> LUL 

[15:37] <fruez> Someone cyberbully me so I can show Captain how to defend himself 

[15:37] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, So are you saying Phil told him he had a mic up his ass? That was clearly 
the other guy. 

[15:37] <encelor> @Fruez white cis male Keepo 

[15:37] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb or whenever that captain guy uploads whatever he recorded 
[15:37] <brahski20> @ChairmanCaleb *Fill 

[15:38] <fruez> @encelor How dare you, you SJW, Neon Coloured Hair Scum Kappa 

[15:38] <everythingO> This chat is so entertaining, guy literally is incompetent in a game and gets kicked and 

raged at, and everyone flips out 

[15:38] <vendatus> fruez you suck and yo momma shoulda aborted you Kappa 
[15:38] <elena_arboria> @Fruez you sir are a baffon! 

[15:38] <themaskmann> turn the other cheek 

[15:38] <wxrxaxtxh> Captain stop whispering me man, tell @DarksydePhil how you feel! 

[15:38] <encelor> @Fruez respect my white guilt priviledge or els imina cry murder and say you raped me 
[15:38] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, See, if he's uploading this, don't you think there was some ulterior motive 
in the first place? He knew that if he ignored what they were saying, people would start getting impatient and 
inveitably annoyed. How are you not putting two and two together? 

[15:38] <encelor> Kappa 

[15:38] <fruez> @Vendatus You cheered to DSP, Your parents are proud Kappa 

[15:38] <brahski20> Captain you can whisper me bro

[15:39] <encelor> why you want someone to whisper you are you derich? 

[15:39] <silkyenigma> Hey Captain, tell Airelor to fuck himself.

[15:39] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb thats to many ifs put together, nobody knew that was gonna happen you're 

just sounding paranoid af lol 

[15:39] <papalouthefirst> dsp is so cute 

[15:39] <themaskmann> I'm here for the gameplay tho 

[15:39] <cookiemonster414> something tells me that capt planned to do this in order to upload it and get his 15 
mins of fame 

[15:39] <brahski20> @SilkyEnigma Fill doesn’t ahve friends because people don’t want to have to deal wtih the 

glitches that follow fill around 

[15:39] <jii_el> @papalouthefirst go ahead and holla 

[15:39] <encelor> Fil is kawai desu

[15:40] <wxrxaxtxh> Captain I appreciate your reasoning, and I agree with you. Whisper @ChairmanCaleb 
because he is confused. 

[15:40] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, I would advise you to look up the definition of paranoia, that's not what's 
going on, lol. If you're so blinded that you obviously can't see the main intent of what this was about, then you’re 
just blind. 

[15:40] <darthradovanviking> cheer 1000 hello how is everyone doing? 

[15:40] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> what's captains twitch username?

[15:41] <hobbsl017> @DarthRadovanViking u missed the drama

[15:41] <hobbsl017> nah captain was a douche 

[15:41] <papalouthefirst> im with daddysydephil 

[15:41] <darthradovanviking> what the hell are you talking about? 

[15:41] <darthradovanviking> I never heard about any captain 
[15:41] <themaskmann> these next gen graphics 

[15:42] <popsicolo> @DarthRadovanViking Long story short, one of Phil's teammates camped and killed 
zombies and wouldn’t help his team in any other way. 

[15:42] <kushiyakitori> @DarthRadovanViking you have to see the videos. 

[15:42] <silkyenigma> Captain, tell the Airelord to go fuck himself next time 

[15:42] <theycallmejimbob> the chat has jumped the shark Vidar get out while you still can 

[15:42] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> captain murica 

[15:42] <hobbsl017> i agreed with phil and the others 

[15:42] <wxrxaxtxh> CAPTAIN = GOD! 

[15:42] <sprank_n> @ChairmanCaleb i'm not blind to anything i just don’t think everyone that does something 
wrong is immediately a detractor unlike you, but tbh i don't give a fuck. 

[15:42] <brahski20> I am pro captain and anti fill and autist guy 
[15:42] <darthradovanviking> I am the captain here 

[15:42] <sirnoblex> @hobbsl017 I don’t think Captain was a douche. Yes, he didn’t revive his teammates. But 
I'm sure if you were playing with friends you would do the same as Captain did. 

[15:42] <fruez> @DarthRadovanViking And He survived longer than DSP and His salt mine teammates. He was 
a H.E.R.O 

[15:42] <katexo234> jimbob PowerUpR LUL LUL 
[15:42] <brahski20> Fill has a glitched controller now 
[15:42] <kovorus> controller glitch LUL 

[15:42] <bootytease> @DarthRadovanViking captain was a detractor he just trolled phil for about an hour in call 
of duty 

[15:42] <brahski20> The 12 button glitched right off 



[15:42] <lieutenantworf_> The room is shaking phil 
[15:42] <lieutenantworf_> It's not glitched 
[15:42] <slayer_l l_king> More glitches

[15:42] <wxrxaxtxh> @DarthRadovanViking Dont believe others, Captain was helping out a lot 
[15:42] <darthradovanviking> ok there is no drama here anymore. IT ended 
[15:42] <themaskmann> get better 

[15:42] <hobbsl017> @SirNobleX lrnao no I wouldnt. if I was playing with friends I would work with thm 
[15:42] <themaskmann> keep up

[15:43] <sprank_n> lol 

[15:43] <speedweed_> dilly dilly, Captain 

[15:43] <jii_el> hmm 

[15:43] <darthradovanviking> I don’t know and don’t see any captains. 

[15:43] <sirnoblex> @hobbsl017 Not talking about playing with Phil, just in general with your friends. 

[15:43] <brahski20> Filladelphia 

[15:43] <kushiyakitori> captain wasn’t all that helpful before but when the 3 were downed then he was helpful 
and may have advanced them to the next round 

[15:43] <silkyenigma> Captain, tell your side of the story on a detractor podcast. 

[15:43] <hobbsl017> yea I know what your talking about and no i wouldnt I would work with my team 
[15:43] <lieutenantworf_> does phil not use ironsights? 

[15:43] <chairmancaleb> @sprank_n, No, you do. Otherwise you would have stopped responding a long time 
ago. "He ignores what everyone says, continues to selfishly stay in the corner, acts surprised after he's removed. 
Then proceeds to upload how mean Phil was to him." If that's not blind, then I don't know what is. 

[15:43] <lieutenantworf_> i'm dying watching this hip fire 
[15:43] <musasplanet> spray and pray... 

[15:43] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Captain whisper me HeyGuys

[16:40] <neospartanhesperos9> in europe it's probably mostly just cars being used or smuggled weapons so it's 
less likely to see stuff like what happens in the US.

[16:41] <soul_essl2> @Silvaaasuitcase I know, I'm making a point. Removing guns in the USA will never 
happen.

[16:42] <silvaaasuitcase> from like 50 years ago 
[16:43] <obltv> you just type the cheer out 

[16:43] <neospartanhesperos9> the problem with removing guns in the US is there are so many households with 
guns and so many people adamant about keeping them that a serious problem could happen when the people 
come to collect their weapons.

again, not every muslim does this but the community as a whole is more likely to do those crimes because it's 
acceptable where they come from.
