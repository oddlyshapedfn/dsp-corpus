[15:07] <masterxeon2002> adblock might be an issue as well 
[15:07] <nazraiii> Thata€™s a question for google themselves 
[15:07] <haseox4> @eliqsir Phil wants to finish the main games b4 doing the die 
[15:07] <darthradovanviking> I use adblock + never been any problem 
[15:07] <timboslicegb> why is stream late 

[15:07] <somedirtyhobos> @DarksydePhil the 30 day thing kinda sucks, but I can deal with it. I work about 90 
hours a week 

[15:08] <eliqsir> what do you mean Haseox4 ? 

[15:08] <nazraiii> @darksydephil will you be reviewing this game? Ia€™m interested in picking it up, but not 
sure 

[15:08] <eliqsir> which main games ? 

[15:08] <haseox4> @eliqsir he takes about this during his prestream today 
[15:08] <haseox4> Talkes 

[15:08] <masterxeon2002> unlimited, with a time lock 

[15:09] <masterxeon2002> wahhhht 

[15:09] <nazraiii> @darksydephil nice5Y‘CE5Yn □ 

[15:09] <haseox4> He wanted to finish AC,sonic, along with some other items 
[15:10] <thebigtj 1337> Philadelphia is apparently too 
[15:10] <pablofortunata> Nashville 

[15:10] <masterxeon2002> doesn’t this game have a ton of side content though? 

[15:10] <darthradovanviking> if it isn't like wappapukko something it's probably not from america :D 

[15:10] <airhead793d2jsp> PogChamp 

[15:10] <pablofortunata> Philadelphia is greek 

[15:10] <thebigtjl337> In Egypt according to this game 

[15:10] <jefoliveira90> Greece 

[15:11] <pablofortunata> delphi = city, phila = brotherly love 

[15:11] <haseox4> Phil youa€™ll have better luck getting legendary equipment doing the papyrus riddles 

[15:11] <pablofortunata> city of brotherly love 

[15:11] <thebigtj 1337> oh greece, scale is a lot smaller 

[15:11] <infinite_sphere> @pablofortunata SeemsGood 

[15:11] <cookiemonster414> i like Philadelphia on my toast Kappa 

[15:12] <jefoliveira90> Yeah, a rock 

[15:12] <darthradovanviking> well that is interesting, so seatle is named after some indian chief. 

[15:12] <airhead793d2jsp> i like it with eggplants 
[15:13] <nazraiii> The atmosphere in this game is epic 
[15:13] <encelor> roasted garlic and piment cream cheese 
[15:13] <encelor> Kreygasm 
[15:14] <masterxeon2002> fuck 

[15:15] <thebigtjl337> the only ones worth upgrading are the legendaries tbh 
[15:15] <encelor> A 

[15:18] <thebigtj 1337> thread and needle icon if you come across one 
[15:18] <derpsquadkyle> 6Y ,0 5Y’° 6Y’° 

[15:19] <tomahawkings> You can equip 2 bows and switch on the fly 
[15:20] <superbatcat> I got over 102 hours into this game 
[15:20] <haseox4> He should work on upgrading the hidden blade 
[15:20] <tomahawkings> I got under 102 hours 

[15:21] <xxxnemesisxxx> ah yes the stealthy assassins and their giant axes Kappa 

[15:21] <thebigtj 1337> what exactly are they rebelling against 

[15:21] <encelor> greeks

[15:23] <anzo8836> nice work 

[15:23] <encelor> can't you just parry kill the strong warriors? 

[15:23] <encelor> or use fire arrows 
[15:23] <encelor> poison 

[15:23] <anzo8836> Think the stronger warriors are a lot more harder to deal damage to 

[15:24] <thebigtj 1337> they're pretty stupid, I just assassinate them over and over until they die 

[15:24] <encelor> pretty sure you can abuse status ailments to lower their hp since it does %of health 

[15:25] <encelor> give viking them pomin pomins 

[15:25] <thebigtjl337> here you are bayek, garbage, for you 

[15:25] <dukexjt> Those suck 

[15:25] <haseox4> You can find them anywhere 

[15:27] <superbatcat> you get a cool costume by killing the Phylakes and good weapons 

[15:28] <thebigtj 1337> I'm disappointed with the amount of outfits in the game 

[15:28] <danjack007> hunter on level 20 is in alexandria, phil should kill him 

[15:29] <superbatcat> killing elephants in this game is a real bitch 

[15:30] <encelor> just use poison or bleed it'll be ez 

[15:30] <encelor> and have the highgroundor you'll end up like anikin
