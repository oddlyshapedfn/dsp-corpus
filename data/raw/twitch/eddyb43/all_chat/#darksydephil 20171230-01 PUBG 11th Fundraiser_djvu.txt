[11:16] <theycallmejimbob> hey delta KonCha 
[11:16] <glorytobeh> sup all 

[11:16] <ratchefanl2> @theycalhnejimbob good manjust work has needed me a lot recently havent been able to 
be on a stream 

[11:16] <calebsteventrey> doods ! 

[11:17] <thenewfaceofcreation> What game phil is playing today 
[11:17] <theycallmejimbob> PlayerUnknown 
[11:17] <nich2440> batttlegrounds 



[11:17] <me_ree> i thought he hated pubg, watching that is boring 
[11:17] <calebsteventrey> pay my taxes for me 

[11:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> @CalebStevenTrey never heard of it. Is it good ? 

[11:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[11:18] <calebsteventrey> some doods like it 

[11:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> @me_ree its better than La norie 

[11:19] <nich2440> La Noire is old thouygh 

[11:19] <calebsteventrey> :P 

[11:19] <me_ree> at least things are happening progressively when watching him play LA Noire, pubg usually 
just is a lot of nothing while he hides lol 
[11:19] <nich2440> not the best comparison

[11:20] <calebsteventrey> i will get right on it 

[11:20] <duderito2> he gets increased participation when playing PUBG so that was a motivating factor me ree 
[11:20] <thenewfaceofcreation> @me_ree phil did good tho. He won by doing nothing. That my friend is called 
skill 

[11:20] <kozatof> @darksydephil hi 
[11:20] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 
[11:20] <calebsteventrey> lul 

[11:20] <theycallmejimbob> the famous pacifist run :D 

[11:20] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> I'm hoping MGS 2 wins the poll but will be 3 most likely 

[11:21] <blue_blur64> pokketLURK pokketLURK pokketLURK pokketLURK pokketLURK pokketLURK 

[11:21] <me_ree> increased participation? sounds like a way of saying it's the most financially-rewarding game 

so Phil puts his personal feelings for the game to one side so he can milk it for all its worth, fair enough, gotta 

pay the bills, it's just boring to watch 

[11:21] <ratchefanl2> i love snake eater man its so epic 

[11:21] <thenewfaceofcreation> @blue_blur64 hi dood. Whats up 

[11:21] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi @ratchefanl2 

[11:21] <theycallmejimbob> hey Silent KonCha 

[11:21] <ratchefanl2> hey newface 

[11:21] <duderito2> you worded it better than me me ree :D 

[11:21] <thenewfaceofcreation> Im just wating for him to play mgs tbh 

[11:22] <blue_blur64> So I tried out my new Astro A 10s :P 

[11:22] <bethelewd> hey ratche, delta, silent and jimbob 

[11:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> And i heard phil did hit the goal 

[11:22] <theycallmejimbob> BeTheLewd dspAngrydsp 

[11:22] <blue_blur64> The first one, yes 

[11:22] <me_ree> how lucky it'll only cost fans 2000 dollars to watch him play the same game he did years ago. 
lucky 

[11:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> @BeTheLewd hi dood 
[11:22] <bethelewd> phil hit the 1st tier 
[11:22] <ratchefanl2> me ree your pushing it 
[11:22] <calebsteventrey> doods ! 

[11:22] <suckasurprise> yo guys 

[11:22] <bethelewd> but not the 2nd tier 

[11:22] <me_ree> almost as good a bargain as Salah was for Liverpool 

[11:22] <nich2440> watching him play PUBG is boring to me but if it brings in views It makes sense that he 
keeps playing it. 

[11:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> @BeTheLewd he wont hit the other one 



[11:22] <theycallmejimbob> hey CalebStevenTrey and suckasurprise KonCha 
[11:22] <blue_blur64> why so negative D: 

[11:23] <steveeroodey> doods 

[11:23] <suckasurprise> @theycalbnejimbob Hey dude 
[11:23] <bethelewd> delta i hope he does 

[11:23] * thenewfaceofcreation is sad that blue_blur64 ignored him 

[11:23] <duderito2> I thought you were gonna say Oxlade Chamberlain me ree 

[11:23] <bethelewd> lol 

[11:23] <steveeroodey> has pc does not play decent pubg, k... 

[11:23] <me_ree> the Ox that's rarely in the box? 

[11:23] <blue_blur64> pokketFEELS 

[11:24] <calebsteventrey> hey @theycallmejimbob 

[11:24] <thenewfaceofcreation> @blue_blur64 wau. No dspsad emote. Surprising 

[11:24] <me_ree> probably the weirdest signing of the summer was Ox joining Liverpool 

[11:24] <bethelewd> dspPepe 

[11:24] <blue_blur64> I like using other emotes with other channels instead of the one I got them from, sharing 
the love 

[11:24] <kozatof> @ratchefanl2 can you mod me 

[11:25] <bethelewd> danzFisher danzYugo danzCooper danzLove danzLove danzLove danzLove

usually do, they better do it for patreon 
[11:25] <me_ree> sounds legit #Kod4Mod 

[11:25] <blue_blur64> Plus the pokket emotes are new to me, gotta spam them pokketLUL

[11:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> Ikr 

[11:27] <steveeroodey> many mods 

[11:27] <calebsteventrey> why did he clear chat 

[11:27] <ratchefanl2> @TheNewFaceofCreation not much man i just been busy work has needed me a lot 

havent been out to a stream recently for the last few days 

[11:27] <thenewfaceofcreation> @ratchefanl2 last pre stream was just chaos 

[11:27] <ratchefanl2> @TheNewFaceofCreation yes many brownies made their way here 

[11:28] <ratchefanl2> @TheNewFaceofCreation i watched the vid on youtube 

[11:28] <me_ree> let's not open that can of worms again lol 

[11:28] <me_ree> end of the day, it's only circumstantial evidence that it's true 

[11:28] <powerhourpodcast> dsp rules 

[11:29] <ratchefanl2> me ree dont worry im just saying i watched yesterdays prestream on youtube 
[11:29] <thenewfaceofcreation> @Powerhourpodcast rules the salt factory indeed 
[11:29] <ratchefanl2> jelsea betrayed phil too 
[11:29] <steveeroodey> save the house 



[11:29] <kingofhypocrisy> Are detractors going to be referred to as brownies now? 

[11:29] <powerhourpodcast> rules the video game factory 
[11:29] <calebsteventrey> crazy 

[11:29] <me_ree> i wouldn't call it a 'betrayal', jelsea followed their own line of enquiry and believes an escort 
over Phil, that's the simple truth of it 

[11:30] <powerhourpodcast> his great and he should block every detractor 

[11:30] <thenewfaceofcreation> @KingOfHypocrisy the sons of brownies and brownies world order would be 
proud 

[11:30] <ratchefanl2> me ree well jelsea is dumb that escort isnt real 

[11:30] <me_ree> the escort is absolutely real - the story, on the other hand, is up for debate. 

[11:30] <calebsteventrey> is he coming on or drinking again 

[11:30] <powerhourpodcast> honestly who cares what people think dsp should just do what he does best make 
content 

[11:31] <steveeroodey> the escort is a troll just really good at baiting 

[11:31] <kingofhypocrisy> @TheNewFaceofCreation Ah yes I forgot about them. Bred Buchs is their leader I 
presume 

[11:31] <clubsoda69> what time does the stream begin today? 

[11:31] <powerhourpodcast> sounds like the escort is just trying to get her name out thier 
[11:31] <nich2440> escort missions are the worst anyway 
[11:31] <theycallmejimbob> usually begins around now 

[11:31] <thenewfaceofcreation> @KingOfHypocrisy he is thevlost brother of fred fucks dood 
[11:31] <darkciders> I'm ready for some pubg craziness, woooo 
[11:31] <thenewfaceofcreation> Lost 

[11:31] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> come 12th January all the detractors are going to get shit on by this catfish 
[11:31] <bethelewd> GOING BACK IN TIIIIME 

[11:31] <me_ree> that twitter handle pre-dates the creation of the first tihydp videos and they seem to be a 
legitimate escort, it does not mean their story is true but i believe they're who they say they are at least. 

[11:31] <thatotaku> Hope the pre stream is good today 
[11:32] <steveeroodey> why the 12th... 

[11:32] <darksydephil> so you’re super gullible then? lol 
[11:32] <me_ree> who is super gullible, and why? 

[11:32] <calebsteventrey> lul 

[11:32] <powerhourpodcast> alot of gullible people gossip on the internet 

[11:32] <kingofhypocrisy> Some one said there is videos of the escort sucking dicks so she's real but the story is 
probably bs imo 

[11:32] <darksydephil> first off, escorts don’t have public twitter accounts, because escorting is a DISCREET 
PROFESSION, as in, when you have one, you don’t want the world to know, and you don’t want the girl 
blabbing about it 

[11:32] <clubsoda69> DSP is the only reason i watch TWITCH or YOUTUBE 
[11:33] <darksydephil> how would you like that to be your dick in one of the videos? 

[11:33] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> A 

[11:33] <leonaras> I doubt the chick is a catfish, but i also dont give the escort thing any weight. Theres another 
motive. Fuck knows what it is though. 

[11:33] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[11:33] <calebsteventrey> are we gonna debate the escort thawng again all stream 
[11:33] <kingofhypocrisy> @DarksydePhil No way dood, I don’t want an std 
[11:33] <critical_for_d4ys> hi phil. how are you doing ? 

[11:33] <ornightz> these Escort allegations are continuing today as well huh ajsPalm 

[11:33] <powerhourpodcast> @darksydephil seems like the person created the account and based it on a legit 
person 

[11:33] <bethelewd> jim is shocked cause man u cant win 5-0 like chelsea :) 

[11:33] <nich2440> God we just love beating a dead horse don’t we 



[11:33] <darksydephil> there were two "Escorts" who were catfishing everyone in my stream chat back when i 
used twitch in 2013/2014 and it turned out they were fake accounts, despite having all this evidence and history, 
people are just fucking stupid 
[11:34] <calebsteventrey> omg 

[11:34] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil hey phil sorry i havent made it out to a stream in the last few days work 
has needed me a lot recently 

[11:34] <bennelicious> At least all the drama is more entertaining that the stream <3 

[11:34] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe don't talk to me BeTheLewd another horrendous match to watch 

[11:34] <darksydephil> Powerhourpodcast: thats how catfishing works lol 

[11:34] <nich2440> why are we still talking about the escort? 

[11:34] <darksydephil> Nich2440 : because some people are dumb as rocks apparently 
[11:34] <ratchefanl2> caleb relax dude we are not doing this all stream 
[11:34] <calebsteventrey> can we get to the game 
[11:34] <calebsteventrey> good 

[11:34] <nich2440> Yeah but you're also talking about it lol 
[11:34] <ratchefanl2> CALEB RELAX 

[11:34] <critical_for_d4ys> @DarksydePhil you already explained to the idiots how wrong they are last stream, 
lets make this a positive stream :) 

[11:34] <me_ree> it's a good shout actually caleb - let's get the gameplay going. 

[11:34] <dukexjt> Phil you see the SWATTing shooting in the news? 

[11:34] <clubsoda69> cheer 10 excited for stream today 

[11:34] <kingofhypocrisy> I saw on kiwifarms the escort claimed she was in contact with pandalee so it's bs dood 
[11:35] <b2gamer321> @DarksydePhil Do you eat white bread or do you eat one of those exotic breads? 

[11:35] <duderito2> don’t answer that question Phil it's another trick question about the escort :D 
[11:35] <calebsteventrey> lul 

[11:35] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @b2gamer321 brown bread is exotic? cmon B ruh 
[11:35] <darksydephil> i dont even kn ow wtf an exotic bread is lol! 

[11:35] <me_ree> all I know is that I'm really surprised how subdued Phil’s response has been to this. Usually 
he’s be pulling the middle fingers out to this one person accusing him of all sorts and saying 'fuck you you stupid 
fuck' and stuff, he's really held back it's weird. Phil has every right to completely and publicly tear into this 
person for their slander and lies 
[11:35] <bethelewd> yes 

[11:36] <kingofhypocrisy> So what is Phil playing today for the marathon? Pubg? 

[11:36] <b2gamer321> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz I mean like pumpernickel and stuff 
[11:36] <kozatof> @darksydephil you are a good friend my g 

[11:36] <ornightz> It’s a bait and switch tactic it's empty allegations but it'll keep persisting , best to just ignore it 
[11:36] <nich2440> it's red lobster cheddar biscuits according to Michael Jones. 

[11:36] <electrumguy> @DarksydePhil what video are you talking about? 

[11:36] <kozatof> @darksydephil leta€™s go to Vegas and get some whores my man 
[11:36] <me_ree> even vidar wants police involvement 

[11:36] <ratchefanl2> me ree phil just wants to make content simple he just wants to have fun streaming 
[11:36] <powerhourpodcast> @darksydephil people just like to start shit ive been watching you since 2009 and i 
have to come out and defend you this bullshit is out of contol keep doing you thing phil 
[11:36] <calebsteventrey> lol 

[11:36] <leonaras> @me_ree you need to be more subtle dood D: 

[11:37] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @kozatof LUL 

[11:37] <me_ree> @ratchefanl2 do you remember AlphaOmegaSin? Look how Phil responded to that. This is 

WAY bigger than that 

[11:37] <ratchefanl2> me ree thats true 

[11:37] <calebsteventrey> hows the gf 

[11:38] <darksydephil> me ree enough, stop talking about it be i dont care and im not going to have the entire 
discussion around it 



[11:38] <me_ree> my point is that I'm surprised at the reaction, is all, the lies and slander keep happening from 

this one source and Phil is just letting it happen, really 

[11:38] <calebsteventrey> is she gonna be there for new years 

[11:38] <me_ree> ok then cool 

[11:38] <kingofhypocrisy> wow dood 

[11:38] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[11:38] <kozatof> Woooow 

[11:38] <nich2440> can we just start the stream? 

[11:38] <calebsteventrey> dood ! 

[11:38] <powerhourpodcast> @darksydephil when i see other YouTubers that i once respected start attacking 

you, and you have never even said a word about then thats when i know that this has gone to far 

[11:38] <bos2161> SnowRip 

[11:38] <gautyer> I was just starting reading dood 

[11:38] <firedrake82> phil you realize if escort services were that discrete you would not find them on the 
normal internet right? you would have to go to the dark/deep web where drugs and hitmen and guns and anything 
else illegal are obtainable 

[11:38] <me_ree> who wiped the chat lol i wasn’t done reading 
[11:38] <thenewfaceofcreation> Not again 
[11:38] <thenewfaceofcreation> Lol 
[11:38] <ratchefanl2> sorry guys had to 
[11:38] <calebsteventrey> lulz 

[11:38] <electrumguy> Why was DSP watching the videos offered by the escort? I don't get it.

[11:40] <ratchefanl2> me ree no but things were getting out of hand

[11:40] <markmccauley> What the Hell's this music? 

[11:40] <theycallmejimbob> fan made remixes

[11:40] <thenewfaceofcreation> @Markmccauley god like music dood 

[11:40] <suckasurprise> I literally thought just was just Phil maniacally laughing when the stream loaded but it

pay penalties

[12:18] <vendatus> tbh if you're moving across country why would you keep the tax guy LUL 
[12:18] <pcgamehunter> @Stinkinburrows sadly that's not how the law works, he's have to sue him and basically 
hope he breaks even, which he most likely wont... + years of court would mean he’d have to pay the taxes and 
finance the legal case at the same time and IF he wins, get his money back after. :/ 

[12:18] <drptolemy> :P 
[12:18] <encelor> @tomahawkings lmao

[12:37] <pcgamehunter> Wait... so is this a gameplay stream or a IRL ? 

[12:37] <tengill0> isnt a donation a type of charity 

[12:37] <a2pas> @DarksydePhil hey man, I can get you into a life insurance policy, 2 years, and then it takes 
away the debt and gives your gf maybe $20k 

[12:37] <scruffshark> Wasn't it called a charity before? I could be wrong. 

[12:37] <kingofhypocrisy> This is not #charity 
[12:37] <blue_blur64> It’ll be gameplay pc

[12:38] <bethelewd> yo derich 

[12:38] <gmankyleg> Most youtubers and streamers at the end of their videos/streams are like "Thanks for

saying it but no evidence

[12:42] <whyamispecial> @blue_blur64 Not every message, certainly not. But if it's a known quantity a lot of 
people tip to troll, as long as it's nothing against Twitch's TOS, I figure he would just roll with it and join the 
trolling. You still get the money and the person trolling doesn't get the punchline they were looking for, but still 
gets ^something*. It'd be a win-win.

[13:03] <encelor> @skumbag_horse many ways to get around that tho xD

[14:02] <needhealingindanger> So the bottom line is... he needs money for a second house? 

[14:02] <madranel> Shame on your for lowering your pledges 
[14:02] <residentevilbeating> tips are wrong phil 
[14:02] <needhealingindanger> Okay that's cool

sell the house @NeedHealingInDanger

aren't payed off by the end January @KingKrueliest 

[14:36] <hauntslashl999> cheerlO the "you know every inch of my dick and balls" cheer was a reference to you

ruined their fun 

[14:36] <ndrworld> Gotta milk that money boo 

[14:36] <blue_blur64> @majinboo3 Japanese fans loved Lightning so much that it convinced them to make more 
[14:36] <takii> 5 minutes to piss LUL @d2tz 

[14:36] <vacant_assassin> Therea€™s more of an audience for meme Phil than actual Phil fans 
[14:36] <blue_blur64> It's why she is also used as a mascot for clothing, and recently cars 
[14:36] <txstormsurge> jerking the gherkin time 
[14:36] <encelor> phil is a living meme we cannot deny that 

[14:36] <advcool> what do you think, how much money does phil make every stream ?

isn't confused with the plot of Happy Gilmore? 

[14:36] <vacant_assassin> He needs to get in on it 

[14:36] <idatedecadesyounger> @d2tz he needed to check the DMs the escort is posting if i had to guess, just to 

she what fake stuff she photoshopped into them, remember yesterday, he talked about her for like an hour? so 

nbow that she's leaking DMs he probably wants to know what shes saying

[14:44] <guccithejacuzzi> cheer20 Instead of having all that text on the screen, why not make it look more clean 
and professional by creating a separate overlay and fitting the entire stream onto the overlay so that there's empty 
space for the text to be there. Just google stream overlays and you'll see what I mean. Regardless I love that 
you're implementing this. It'll attract people to get more involved I think. 

[14:44] <guccithejacuzzi> paragraphs btw LUL 

[14:44] <yuhikyaku> who remembers heavy rain and god of war gameplay. those where funny

[14:45] <marblestherabbit> Those N64 textures

[14:46] <txstormsurge> Is this Xbox 1 X or S? 

[14:46] <kamjerzy> cheer 10 people who complain about your overlay should donate the money for you to get a 
graphic designer 6Y’°

[14:47] <admiralprawn> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce He would need a wife to cheat on first. 

[14:47] <vacant_assassin> Phila€™s tax return is way longer than yours. When he stands up it goes way down to 
the floor. Nobodya€™s tax return is like his. Women love his tax return 
[14:47] <ratchefanl2> Lester? 

[14:47] <yuhikyaku> don’t blame Photoshop for you being horrible 



[14:47] <encelor> the way phil says tractor sounds like detractor 
[14:47] <yuhikyaku> just saying 

[14:47] <facehatl234> hes gotten hundreds of dollars today, how can he not afford a graphic designer 
[14:47] <glitch_crazed> Ikr @encelor

[14:47] <idatedecadesyounger> @Facehatl234 , why should he? 

[14:47] <butter_my_bread> Did popsicolo make the overlay like the chat badges n notifications 

[14:47] <txstormsurge> We know you are not. Calm down 
[14:47] <yuhikyaku> oh no another killer detractor 
[14:47] <rotoch4mp> overlays are for infants 
[14:47] <xtaker> Wow seriously? Just google it. 

[14:47] <supertechnofunk> Bullshit and thrown together, like your like 
[14:47] <supertechnofunk> Life* 

[14:47] <blue_blur64> Pop didn't make these overlays 
[14:47] <vacant_assassin> But you used to build gaming pcs 

[14:47] <facehatl234> idk maybe if he actually cared about how his stream looked and stream quality he should 

invest some money into it 

[14:47] <imaidenr> we didnt think you were 

[14:47] <encelor> i am a normal dude like you guys owns 2 house Keepo 
[14:48] <encelor> LUL

[14:48] <advcool> @Vacant_Assassin good point 

[14:48] <pcgamehunter> I can tell you’re not a graphic designer because you only know Photoshop Kappa 
[14:48] <encelor> sorry i am not buying that 

[14:48] <admiralprawn> Building a PC is different from the software aspect. 

[14:48] <ndrworld> Where pow block at 
[14:48] <encelor> LUL 

[14:48] <idatedecadesyounger> @Facehatl234. he doesn't though, he never said he does, stop being a detractor.

[14:48] <butter_my_bread> Doc Zombious? @blue_blur64 

[14:48] <yuhikyaku> stop being a killer tractor 

[14:48] <coffeemode> "fundraising" for your own neglect of paying taxes, own up to your mistakes and pay your 
own debts. 

[14:48] <arrolhere> there's a bunch of free alternatives 

[14:48] <facehatl234> he never said he cared about his stream? what?

[14:48] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Phil, I really enjoyed your top 10 disappointing games of 2017. Really nice 
khantent 

[14:48] <skumbag_horse> @coffeemode its not his fault and this fundraising is to pay his taxes 
[14:48] <guccithejacuzzi> cheer50 I didn’t mean to be harsh Phil. But you don't need to do everything yourself, 
I'm sure people will do those overlays for you asking for nothing in return, myself included. And trust me, it 
looks like a hassle but you can even put up stuff like that on the most basic of tools like MS Paint. 



[14:48] <yuhikyaku> phil titty stream time 

[14:48] <idatedecadesyounger> @Facehatl234 , yeah, he has made it pretty clear he’d rather not make a change 
just for "quality" bcause that isn't what this is about 
[14:48] <glitch_crazed> dspEw 

[14:49] <coffeemode> @skumbag_horse if you dont pay taxes it is entirely your fault 
[14:49] <batsute> Jeez it's not that hard to find a template 

[14:49] <coffeemode> you dont get to blame your accountant, its YOUR job to know what you have to pay

[14:49] <batsute> There are a ton of free online editors.

issues for a few hours, lol

clear that its YOUR responsibility

[14:51] <butter_my_bread> Moving across the country and not getting a new attorney that is privy to the

support this anymore Ia€™m not gonna spread hate but I will not be involved with this. Plus this whole tax

[15:59] <dukexjt> cheer 10 car chaasing you 

[15:59] <bionich00t> To be honest when I saw this was a fundraiser I expected some variety like a fundraiser 
would have, maybe some fighting games, not the same shitty game for hours? This game is awful and literally 
nothing happens for 90% of the stream. 

[16:00] <rockstar0182> @CreepySpaghetti47 its either dicks or the n word 
[16:00] <encelor> @Sacriel terrible 
[16:00] <encelor> LUL 

[16:00] <lbuttondash> what does clothes do for the character? just visuals? 

[16:00] <bomber_man_mulayim> this game is like bitcoin, does not make sense. 

[16:00] <kinggoken> lol @Bionich00t 



[16:00] <bethelewd> phil run some suckers over 
[16:00] <feignit> LUL @Bionich00t 
[16:00] <ripbillding> 1 button pretty much 

[16:00] <kinggoken> even I was saying he should play some Street Fighter 2 (Switch version) 

[16:00] <factorbactorjr> i love when people compare this to begging LUL , begging implies nothing in return, 

you are getting content in return, regardless if you like it or not, that is irrelevant 

[16:00] <creepyspaghetti47> @Rockstar0182 In my case it’d be spic 

[16:00] <theycallmejimbob> Salty Saturday dspHmm 

[16:00] <bionich00t> I wish Phil would play SF2 over this 

[16:00] <creepyspaghetti47> KomodoHype 

[16:00] <bionich00t> This game is garbage 

[16:00] <encelor> most streamers do this anyway 

[16:00] <skooma_dealer> @factorbactorjr 1/10 

[16:00] <encelor> LUL 

[16:01] <skooma_dealer> apply yourself next time 
[16:01] <factorbactorjr> ? 

[16:01] <rotoch4mp> this game gud 

[16:01] <lbuttondash> @Bionich00t if he played sf2 he would lose over half his viewers 
[16:01] <thatanonyraccoon> applications can be found in DSP's condo 

[16:01] <feignit> DSP said himself he isnt most streamers we should hold him to a higher standard dspHmm 
[16:01] <mrgaminboi> @encelor mosf streamers provide better content though 

[16:01] <lord_dink> HeyGuys Xbox version has bad framerates and bugs but at least there's no aimbot cheaters 
like on PC. 

[16:01] <zaisuro> shoot someone 

[16:01] <benverity> @factorbactorjr How much dick do you gobble? Serious question. 

[16:01] <horror_duck_l> OK bye everyone really enjoyed the stream today Phil but Its pretty late in the UK so 
I'm gonna head off. 

[16:01] <encelor> @MrGaminBoi that is subjective xD 
[16:01] <dylannw> WOD □ 

[16:01] <pureo_nikku> isn’t that just an opinion @encelor 

[16:01] <eternia_forever> Lets not forget about mayonaise monday dood @theycallmejimbob 

[16:01] <bionich00t> This isn't about viewers it's about entertaining the viewers enough to donate to the 

fundraiser 

[16:01] <factorbactorjr> all of the dicks :D 

[16:01] <mrgaminboi> @encelor compared to Phil its the truth 

[16:01] <bionich00t> This game is boring and terrible 

[16:01] <spyder310x> for someone who talks so much crap about this game u play it quite often lol @dsp 
[16:01] <vbastus> did he win a game yet? 

[16:01] <trihard41iife> @Rockstar0182 feels good knowing there's such losers in the world and you're above 
them LUL 

[16:02] <pureo_nikku> @MrGaminBoi isn't that just an opinion 
[16:02] <pureo_nikku> sorry @encelor mistake 
[16:02] <theycallmejimbob> :D never heard of that Eternia Forever 
[16:02] <trihard41iife> @vbastus he won the game thst is my heart 

[16:02] <shega_ace> idk any streamer that does this for 5+ hours a day and doesn’t remind their viewers how 
they can support them to keep doing it

[16:02] <mxavier91> How long is he streaming for???

[16:24] <guccithejacuzzi> @encelor that wasn’t the argument tho. The argument was whether or not he was 
noticing chat at all. 

[16:25] <michingmallecho> I saw this raw content,once before; it didna€™t scare me then, it does now. 

[16:25] <divanerasmus> What about me phil am i cool 
[16:25] <imaidenr> he is right though

punch in their life.

[16:27] <guccithejacuzzi> @factorbactorjr the answer is obvious, but that was never the argument. Argument 
was if he recognized the non-paying chat at all.

[16:28] <me_ree> I'd like to congratulate Phil for raising $1623 dollars so far in December for Patreon, a really 
solid drive and there's still a day left to make the 2000 goal! Shout-out to Akshaye, doing great work bud

dollars! Nearly there 

[16:30] <frottz> he deserve it Kappa 

[16:30] <markymark52> I've never heard of a fundraising stream where someone raises funds just for themselves

[16:31] <masterxeon2002> probably your best bet 
[16:31] <encelor> @markymark52 he is a streamer 

[16:31] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @thatanonyraccoon just saying and this is coming from having to pay business 

tax. If he really wasna€™t paying it theya€™d shut him down and repo all his stuff. Not to mention hea€™d still 

owe money regardless if they came for him. Thata€™s why this situation is weird because of the fact he still 

doesna€™t have a price from them? They send it by mail and Ita€™s not hard to miss 

[16:31] <amoxeris> cheerlO it goes down in the dms phil 

[16:31] <shega_ace> i don’t do stealth i’d rather run in guns blazing

[16:32] <encelor> league of legends streamer @markymark52 



[16:32] <me_ree> btw the quarterly business taxes are due January 31st, so you have 4 weeks to go, not 2 weeks 

as you said earlier Phil, no idea why you said 2 weeks before, was really odd 

[16:32] <martyl3612> @leokira whoever you are, I cant seem to whisper @ you 

[16:32] <uppercasebackspace> I’d say they've been sending him letter for 3 years if it's been this long 

[16:32] <eternia_forever> u sleeping ? @theycallmejimbob 

[16:32] <jahabasedgodd> Knows hea€™s gonna owe but thata€™s it

[16:32] <me_ree> happy Hogmanay everyone 

[16:32] <thatanonyraccoon> @LesterTheUnlikely 13 I think because he's been paying taxes, just not all of them, 
they’re working to calculate what's still owed, but I'm not sure. He's definitely going to be making payments, I 
suspect

[17:08] <dadoodl3> yjx 

[17:08] <dadoodl3> thx 

[17:08] <iradiumviking> Previously we used to be able to see what mod did what as a message in the streamchat. 
But that featured disapaired for some reason in the new update to twitch 
[17:08] <hobbsl017> what happened some mod unbanned a bunch of ppl? 

[17:08] <electrumguy> @iradiumviking what about on IRC? 

[17:08] <hobbsl017> i just got here 

[17:09] <electrumguy> Could keep a bot in the IRC channel. 

[17:09] <factorbactorjr> why the hell would twitch remove that? 

[17:09] <iradiumviking> Yeah you can install a ire client and run this chat in it.

[17:09] <electrumguy> That's what I am saying. It'll log unbans on the ire channel. 

[17:09] <thatanonyraccoon> whoa, it will? 

[17:09] <nickrl407> Will there be a stream tomorrow? 

[17:09] <electrumguy> it should @ThatAnonyRaccoon 

[17:09] <iradiumviking> I haven’t done it but i know deep managed to do it once. It is a guide on how to do it on 
twitch 

[17:10] <thatanonyraccoon> well shit, that'd be nifty 
[17:10] <blue_blur64> yes, LA Noire tomorrow 

[17:10] <electrumguy> ridthedragon says he was banned for some unknown reason. 

[17:10] <electrumguy> Claims a mod just randomly banned him. 

[17:10] <electrumguy> he is requesting unban. 

[17:10] <thatanonyraccoon> who the what? 

[17:10] <electrumguy> Thought I’d pass it on. 

[17:10] <thatanonyraccoon> ridthedragon? 

[17:10] <electrumguy> "ridthedragon" yes. 

[17:10] <hobbsl017> what happened? 

[17:10] <thatanonyraccoon> I've had people who were banned in February come up to me and beg for an unban 
[17:11] <thatanonyraccoon> "i was misclicked!!" turns out they mocked DSP lol 
[17:11] <blue_blur64> Several people were asking throughout the day for me 
[17:11] <electrumguy> he says it was some previous mod that went rogue? 

[17:11] <electrumguy> No idea. 



[17:11] <thatanonyraccoon> silly 

[17:11] <iradiumviking> http://tab-bot.net/overrustlelogs/darksydephil 

[17:11] <iradiumviking> I usually use this tool 

[17:11] <kinggoken> is there a second stream tonight or nah? 

[17:11] <iradiumviking> It's very good to see if people are talking true or not 
[17:11] <electrumguy> yes King 

[17:11] <blue_blur64> And I got told that someone doxxed me, but none of that info was mine brownLUL 
[17:12] <kinggoken> awesome :) 

[17:12] <thatanonyraccoon> @iradiumviking and yep, ridthedragon was banned for mocking DSP 
[17:12] <thatanonyraccoon> what a shock 

[17:12] <hodortarg> Metal Gear redemption run is planned on mid January right? 

[17:12] <electrumguy> depends which goal he hits. 

[17:13] <thatanonyraccoon> @HodorTarg yes, if he's only doing one MGS game, he has a week or two to run a 
poll to pick it 

[17:13] <hobbsl017> out of all the recent big donations I feel vidar is the only one who actually cares the most 

bout supporting dsp.... not to start shit but when ppl donate all this $$$ in big sperate donations for multiple shout 

outs they want attention more then help phil 

[17:13] <nik01ai95> why would the poll take so much time 

[17:13] <royalfan> what time is phil going live again 

[17:13] <hobbsl017> no reason for golden colts to do 50 cheers a stream and that other dude could have sent the 
400 in one cheer or to patreon.... just my 2 cents 

[17:14] <thatanonyraccoon> @Nik01ai95 the poll is only for patrons on his forum, so he has o have time to 
activate their accounts for access to the Patron forum 

[17:15] <nik01ai95> i see, don’t you have to be a patreaon to get in on the forums though? 

[17:15] <blue_blur64> No 

[17:15] <blue_blur64> There's a patron only section, but anyone can join 

[17:16] <thatanonyraccoon> I finally saw the "proof that popsi is the rogue mod, and it's total bullshit 

[17:16] <thatanonyraccoon> the screenshot is utter bollocks 

[17:16] <vidarvikinglikeskocc> its not i just blocked out my name anony
