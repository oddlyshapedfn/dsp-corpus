[19:50] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[19:50] <lycifersoul> I do respect Nintendo for still being in the game even tho they were one of the first to start 
the gaming industry 

[19:50] <kinggoken> thats bold @WrangleMcDangle 
[19:50] <rumblerboy0602> PC > PS4 > XBOX ONE 
[19:50] <wranglemcdangle> well i missed it 

[19:50] <factorbactorjr> why do people bother comparing consoles and pc? they are 2 completely different 
experiences 

[19:50] <twitchin20171ul> PC = Switch > PS4 > Xbox 
[19:50] <derichloveslemur> Awesome :) 

[19:51] <hidden_baiken> I think it's easy to compare when they are the same game being played 
[19:51] <youngcud> Those dona€™t know will know what they need to say from theirs hearts... 

[19:51] <lycifersoul> Wasting more than lk on a pc maybe is better than a ps4 but a 300 pc is nothing compared 
to a ps4

[20:03] <thatanonyraccoon> Twelve? A lotta disappointing games this year 
[20:03] <lycifersoul> Therea€™s only 13 
[20:03] <calinks> Jimmy G Buckets! 

[20:03] <skooma_dealer> S J W 

[20:03] <sirnoblex> DJW 

[20:03] <skooma_dealer> DIVERSITY 

[20:03] <sirnoblex> SJW 

[20:03] <kingwhiterabbit> SJW SJW SJW 

[20:03] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 

[20:03] <hidden_baiken> This game should have been so much better 
[20:03] <kingwhiterabbit> lol hell yah Phil 

[20:03] <majinboo3> Saints rows 2 was the best game in the series PERIOD 
[20:03] <vancitychris> gamergate? 

[20:03] <thatanonyraccoon> I SAW A BLACK LADY 
[20:03] <44kpanda> lol 

[20:03] <ornightz> I like AOM but I agree the underground Lair was too much 
[20:03] <hidden_baiken> It's Panthro 
[20:03] <lycifersoul> Fuck over watch!!! 

[20:03] <skooma_dealer> HES BLAACK 

[20:03] <kushiyakitori> the saints row cast was pretty much the same though 
[20:03] <factorbactorjr> saints row 3 was my fav 
[20:03] <calinks> they need to g back to saints ro 

[20:03] <kingwhiterabbit> Phil fellin’ it like it is, raw and unfilitered, that's why I like Phil. 

[20:03] <nich2440> SJW? Really? 

[20:03] <skooma_dealer> overwatch has hot bitches in it 
[20:04] <derichloveslemur> Agents of Mayhem can be repetitive 
[20:04] <ufo8mycat00> mass effect andromeda #1 :P 
[20:04] <hidden_baiken> Overwatch should just delete the men in it 
[20:04] <vendatus> If this wasn't part of Saints Row it'd be decent imo 
[20:04] <nich2440> how is SJW a negative for a game? 

[20:04] <skooma_dealer> tfw no dildo sword 

[20:04] <lycifersoul> Call of duty but more catered to kids 

[20:04] <skooma_dealer> :( 

[20:04] <minnowpause> etc counter plz 

[20:04] <ornightz> One reason Why CRackdoiwn 3 is Delayed .. Underground Lair LUL 
[20:04] <skooma_dealer> dspPepe dspPepe 

[20:04] <kushiyakitori> @Nich2440 i guess phil doesn't like the diverse cast? 

[20:04] <skooma_dealer> I havent played any of these LUL 



[20:04] <hidden_baiken> I like Phil's "announcer" voice. He should do it more often 
[20:04] <kingwhiterabbit> SJWs are evil that's why 

[20:04] <conan_the_barbarian> @Nich2440 i never even thought of SJW when i saw saints row. so disagree 
with phil about that 

[20:04] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Me either, man 
[20:04] <ornightz> So it's top 15 games? 

[20:04] <slimesunday98> Damn 

[20:05] <derichloveslemur> This was a DLC I remember 
[20:05] <majinboo3> This wasnt bad 
[20:05] <skooma_dealer> SJW 

[20:05] <kingwhiterabbit> He's talking about Agents of Mayhem not Saints Row 
[20:05] <majinboo3> its just phil isnt good at stealth lol 
[20:05] <jeangrae2> wasn't he just bad at this game? 

[20:05] <minnowpause> phil quit this one 

[20:05] <conan_the_barbarian> @Nich2440 the game just sucks period. 

[20:05] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[20:05] <vendatus> I agree with this never liked the Dishonored series dspPepe 
[20:05] <hidden_baiken> The game must be really buggy 
[20:05] <nich2440> i didn’t say the game didn't suck 
[20:05] <derichloveslemur> This game was very frustrating 

[20:05] <mustardish> um saints row has a diverse cast too lol what a silly complaint 

[20:05] <vancitychris> progressive is the way forward using insults like sjw is something teenage gamergaters do

[20:08] <nich2440> edited videos has nothing to do with it 
[20:08] <devkitgaming> i like for honor 

[20:08] <jeangrae2> what game do you lose at that you don't blame on lag? 

[20:08] <majinboo3> You need to be a big youtuber who has inside contacs within the google company itself to 
not get demonitzed 

[20:08] <pwnage_101> @Derichloveslemur Well then, what can you do about it. 

[20:08] <nich2440> you're uploading to dspgaming right? 

[20:08] <derichloveslemur> @pwnage_101 yeah true 

[20:08] <hidden_baiken> YouTube is only good for little girls and ASMR 

[20:08] <thatanonyraccoon> Youtube detects that editing took place, and plucks away the money 

[20:08] <majinboo3> For honor had too much of a cmoplicated combat to attract casuals 

[20:08] <skooma_dealer> I was reading this article about latent homosexuals 

[20:08] <majinboo3> it was dead on arrival on pc 

[20:08] <impaiacambridge> is taurus here? 

[20:08] <majinboo3> For honor couldn’t attract the casuals 

[20:08] <jeangrae2> @Hidden_Baiken that's not true, a lot of asmr vids are taken down for being too "sexual" 
[20:08] <skooma_dealer> supposedly in the gaming community there is about 75% latent homosexuality 
[20:08] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Youtube: "Awwww thats cute you put effort into a video Lol" *Demonetized* 
[20:08] <conan_the_barbarian> for honor was disappointing 
[20:08] <skooma_dealer> why do you think that is? 

[20:09] <minnowpause> this game had so many glitches, remember the championships 
[20:09] <hidden_baiken> whaaat? for real? 

[20:09] <derichloveslemur> For Honor was pretty disappointing I agree 
[20:09] <pwnage_101> Will we see the entire countdown here? 

[20:09] <jeangrae2> or just demonetized 
[20:09] <devkitgaming> is lawbreakers on the list 

[20:09] <napoleonsol0> Hey you still doing that fundraiser for yourself? lrnao 

[20:09] <thatanonyraccoon> Youtube doesn’t place less ads on "demonetized" videos, it simply withholds the 
revenue 

[20:09] <skooma_dealer> yea they say the lack of T from sitting all day and not moving can effect the brain to 
make you crave cock 



[20:09] <derichloveslemur> I didn’t like the random Loot boxes 
[20:09] <thatanonyraccoon> Google just says "we keep your money" 

[20:09] <skooma_dealer> weird right? 

[20:09] <hidden_baiken> Loot Boxes need to go 
[20:09] <impaiacambridge> ox 

[20:09] <fallen_one_gaming> hmm YouTube demonetizing their new preferred video format.what geniuses 

they are smh **facepalm** 

[20:09] <conan_the_barbarian> @pwnage_101 i don't think so 

[20:09] <lycifersoul> For Honor seems like the most epic rock paper sissors lol 

[20:09] <skooma_dealer> I think most dudes are gay anyway 

[20:09] <majinboo3> well to be fair it is googles money thats paying youtubers 

[20:09] <mikehuntthedestroyer> "Lootboxes have hit a new low" 

[20:10] <thatanonyraccoon> we only see this part:( 

[20:10] <skooma_dealer> I think they all want the D 
[20:10] <hidden_baiken> how do you see the rest of the video?!

[20:10] <44kpanda> 13 games?

[20:23] <conan_the_barbarian> cheer50 watched the latest farcry 5 gameplay video and the game looks like shit, 
copy and paste from previous far cry games, same graphics,awful AI and glitchy repetitive gameplay. sick of 
these lazy efforts by game devs 
[20:23] <majinboo3> but super ruined it 

[20:23] <thatanonyraccoon> @Skooma_Dealer there are people who SWEAR i ban anyone who has a different 
opinion than DSP 

[20:23] <ufo8mycat00> pc version doesnt look great either tbh, but at least its functional lol 
[20:23] <lycifersoul> Ita€™s still good yo 
[20:23] <thatanonyraccoon> people are silly 

[20:23] <solid_fantasy> The first thing I've ever seen Phil do was the Catherine demo because i was too lazy to 
download it 

[20:23] <skooma_dealer> @ThatAnonyRaccoon not true, not for you 

[20:23] <hidden_baiken> @conan_the_barbarian yeah but now you can shoot Americans! 

[20:23] <brokenheavenii> Super isn’t terrible 
[20:23] <lycifersoul> Super does perfect fan service 
[20:23] <majinboo3> far cry has been the same since the 3rd 
[20:23] <lycifersoul> Screw the bad animation 

[20:23] <mickjones90> the system requirements on pc are ridiculous compared to how the game looks 

[20:23] <stinkinburrows> @conan_the_barbarian except for I get to kill religious ppl Kappa 

[20:24] <thatanonyraccoon> @majinboo3 true, but the first two were the worst 

[20:24] <mickjones90> I'll admit that 

[20:24] <thatanonyraccoon> 2 especially 

[20:24] <ufo8mycat00> indeed mickjones90 

[20:24] <lycifersoul> Super redeemed Gohan in the most epic way! 

[20:24] <kingofbate> someone teach phil how to parachute faster and where to land for good loot, these games 
are slow and boring 

[20:24] <devkitgaming> @darksydephil i saw a game i dont if you play it i was going to gift it to you its on 
steam called postal 

[20:24] <elzorrobot> I think I saw on or two episodes in middle school and thought it was too seen for me then 
[20:24] <vancitychris> farcry 5 is full of sjw politics 
[20:24] <tzomm> yo what up 
[20:24] <majinboo3> far cry 2 was ass 

[20:24] <einhanderz> my mind blows when i think about how dsp fucking sucks at pretty much every single 

game and still gets subs and followers 

[20:24] <thatanonyraccoon> the fuck was that shit? 

[20:24] <hidden_baiken> I am too nervous to play PUBG 

[20:24] <theguywholovesetho> I cana€™t connect to PUBG, anyone else having this issue? 

[20:24] <markmccauley> How are you? 

[20:24] <majinboo3> far cry is made by ubisoft the ultimate SJW cuck organizatiohn 
[20:24] <majinboo3> so dont expect any good writing from them 

[20:24] <thatanonyraccoon> I just remember the end of Fr Cry 2, jumping around a canyon, feeling like an 
asshole

him 

[21:53] <steveofhouse> i do t have many bits left can someone cheer and promise him some bits if he uses a 
grenade? 

[21:53] <conan_the_barbarian> really that is what Phil should do

[21:53] <steveofhouse> or like 200 bits for a grenade kill

[21:53] <yaanul> @timboslicegb Okay, it may not be illegal, but they should still be taught a lesson for putting 
Phil’s livelihood in danger.

[22:17] <frogsonic> think of us

[22:17] <nightbot> ast ra -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[22:17] <madibased> Fucking thing SUCKS!!!! 

[22:17] <pinkdam> phil fired first and had the crosshair right on him but you can't pan as fast as someone can 
move so nothing you can do 

[22:17] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> @djrunol Detractor 
[22:17] <iradiumviking> I hope Phil will become a pc gamer oncew. 

[22:17] <ast_ra> Actually bugged aiming mechanics LUL 
[22:17] <skooma_dealer> he wont 
[22:17] <iradiumviking> and not play PUBG 3 at PS6 
[22:17] <skooma_dealer> he hates troubleshootiing 

[22:17] <bfl_griffon> i feel a lot of Phil’s aiming troubles would be resolved if he played in first person 
[22:17] <hairoftehdog> phil would have gotten 1st place... but the game cheated!!! 

[22:18] <madibased> @hairoftehdog nothing he could do dood 



[22:18] <malebox85> I agree with him ita€™s unplayable. Fortnite is better 
[22:18] <frogsonic> nothing he could do, you saw it 

[22:18] <djrunol> i’ll be any kind of tractor you want, but this is kinda getting lame since he almost always loses 
because of the same reason 

[22:18] <factorbactorjr> fortnite is leaps and bounds better 
[22:18] <dingusmasterl> srlsy 

[22:18] <madibased> Phil motivates me as a streamer. In a weird way. Bless up 
[22:18] <malebox85> Maybe get him an Xbox x 

[22:19] <ast_ra> it pains me to say this but phil is right aiming in this game is like steering a boat. 

[22:19] <eternia_forever> well he did get some kills that game 
[22:19] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> fortine stole most of their ideas from PUBG 
[22:19] <dingusmasterl> lol if you type g o u t it wont let you rofl 
[22:19] <dingusmasterl> thats funny 

[22:19] <madibased> Fortnite is for kids who play Minecraft 
[22:19] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> @dingusmasterl detractor 
[22:19] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil should group up with randoms 
[22:19] <dingusmasterl> not really 

[22:19] <frogsonic> and pubg stole from that other BR mod 

[22:19] <atritusanimus> PUBG stole most of their ideas from H1Z1 KotH, so it's all fair. 

[22:19] <malebox85> @nickyrickydickyanddawn95 and made it better 
[22:19] <frogsonic> anna mod 

[22:19] <dingusmasterl> i just wanted to know if he still had it 

[22:19] <eternia_forever> you see any trailers for game code vein @iradiumviking 

[22:19] <conan_the_barbarian> cheer50 nice try Phil have you updated your gaming calendar yet? 

[22:19] <bfl_griffon> @djrunol Yeah hes not great at the game, but a lot of his complaints are valid. PUBG is 

broken on consoles, but some of it is definitley due to being overly passive 

[22:19] <yaanul> @AtritusAnimus Didn’t PUBG begin as an H1Z1 mod in the first place? 

[22:20] <pray4rock> SnowYeti 

[22:20] <eternia_forever> #SaveTheRecord 

[22:20] <atritusanimus> The guy that made PUBG worked on H1Z1, and broke off to make his own game. 
[22:20] <atritusanimus> With blackjack, and hookers. 

[22:20] <iradiumviking> game code vein? 

[22:20] <frogsonic> basically copied the anna mod 
[22:20] <conan_the_barbarian> who made dayz

about every game he plays so it kinda blurs the line between stuff being his fault or the games fault 
[22:21] <mickjones90> there's a care package in that cooch

[22:22] <bfl_griffon> Rage is part of Phils brand at this point. I honestly think people take what he says too 
seriously 

[22:22] <conan_the_barbarian> the biggest problem with the game on xbox is the frame rate

[22:23] <bausleyfred> i think phil doesnt complain enuff 

[22:23] <neospartanhesperos9> @dingusmasterl I thought you said you were autistic? The military would never 
accept an autist, just saying.

psychologist dignosed me 
[22:23] <iradiumviking> Norwegian 

[22:24] <dingusmasterl> its imposible to have a diagnosis overtrened 
[22:24] <guy_incognito_> i see 
[22:24] <ast_ra> helmet 
[22:24] <sirnoblex> AR 

[22:24] <dingusmasterl> and i cant fly planes either because of adhd 



[22:24] <dingusmasterl> i hate psychiatry — its fucking evil 
[22:24] <atritusanimus> M4 is better because of mods. 

[22:24] <conan_the_barbarian> holy shit he has m4 and ml6 
[22:24] <yungbubby> yes phil an m4s a shotgun 

[22:24] <wjr02003> @darksydephil Remember when you wanted to buy Star Trek Bridge Crew but it was $50? 
It's now $20 so I’d say you dodged a bullet. 

[22:24] <neospartanhesperos9> @dingusmasterl I like psychiatry, it's an art form. CoolStoryBob 
[22:25] <bfl_griffon> @conan_the_barbarian he will be headshotted in the field 
[22:25] <a_2300_l> @DarksydePhil new to the channel, did you play pung on PC? 

[22:25] <sirnoblex> AK is the best gun. Most damage. 

[22:25] <a_2300_l> PUBG 
[22:25] <conan_the_barbarian> pung 

[22:25] <dingusmasterl> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 how so , ? i like jung — and some others — but modern 
psychiatric labeling and the DSM is evil horseshit that ruins lives 

[22:25] <sirnoblex> @A_2300_1 No, his PC can’t handle recording and playing at the same time. 

[22:25] <moonanstreams> m4 is the best full auto ar 
[22:25] <conan_the_barbarian> yes he played PUNG 
[22:25] <bfl_griffon> my ideal loadout is a mini 14 and ump 

[22:25] <dingusmasterl> friend of mine was diagnosed bipolar at 10 years fucking old 
[22:25] <sirnoblex> @Montiblanc Nah, AK is better. 

[22:25] <dingusmasterl> can never fly a plane, buy a gun 

[22:25] <dingusmasterl> etc 

[22:25] <emryl> another gimmick like 3d 

[22:25] <dingusmasterl> its fuckign sick 

[22:25] <concretecasket> vr reminds me of Kinect 

[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> @dingusmasterl 

[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> @dingusmasterl I was joking. 

[22:26] <dingusmasterl> o lol 

[22:26] <iradiumviking> add a mod for you VR headset. Are you not a PHD in programing or something 
@DarksydePhil 

[22:26] <musclesforbones> you can put me on speaker phone phil, and I'll holler out the cheers to you Kappa 
[22:26] <yaanul> I’d like a VR headset, but it's true that we currently lack a viable "excuse" or a "killer app" that 
could pave the way for how we utilize VR platforms in everyday use. 

[22:26] <skooma_dealer> cant you just thank them after the stream? 

[22:26] <a_2300_l> for the peeps that played pubg on pc, do you guys think xbox will be getting the gear PC 
had like the bandana? 

[22:26] <conan_the_barbarian> i don’t think he liked VR 

[22:26] <dingusmasterl> its already hard enough with a bully broher , a really small flacid penis (at least i can 

grow) and being raised in a weird enviornemtn 

[22:26] <eternia_forever> @iradiumviking lol yes 

[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> @iradiumviking LUL 

[22:26] <dingusmasterl> labels dont help 

[22:27] <sirnoblex> @A_2300_1 Don't think so. 

[22:27] <yaanul> For example, when the desktop computer came out, nobody knew what to do with them until 
they became a workplace/productivity staple, thus paving the way for recreational use in the home. 

[22:27] <conan_the_barbarian> that big shit you put on your head...u sweat like crazy 

[22:27] <atritusanimus> @DarksydePhil Maybe have one gun set to single shot for long range, and keep another 
in burst or full auto for intense fire fights. 

[22:27] <conan_the_barbarian> probably can't even breathe 
[22:27] <bfl_griffon> vr cant be good for your eyes 
[22:27] <a_2300_l> @SirNobleX what makes you say that? 

[22:27] <neospartanhesperos9> VR is stupid. I haven’t even tried it and I know it is. Nobody wants to play like 



that every week. 

[22:28] <bfl_griffon> i also feel like its probably just shooting radiation into your head 
[22:28] <dingusmasterl> @DarksydePhil my brother in the military uses VR 
[22:28] <conan_the_barbarian> i wouldn’t want to put that shit on for more than 1 hour 
[22:28] <yungbubby> vr is only for dating actual good girls from anime duh phil 
[22:28] <hairoftehdog> lol, VR radiation? 

[22:28] <conan_the_barbarian> all that fog building up inside the headset annoying as hell 

[22:28] <concretecasket> it'd be cool for sports events though 

[22:28] <neospartanhesperos9> @BFL_Griffon True CoolStoryBob 

[22:28] <yungbubby> when i use vr that isnt sweat 

[22:29] <concretecasket> like a ufc match, but your in the cage with them 

[22:29] <yungbubby> im covered in something else 

[22:29] <yaanul> I'm interested in the Magic Leap headsets they revealed a few days ago. They want an 
Augmented Reality, rather than Virtual Reality. 

[22:29] <hairoftehdog> A true 

[22:29] <dingusmasterl> @DarksydePhil what did you want to be when you were a kid ? my dreams were 
ruined, what were yours ??? 

[22:29] <neospartanhesperos9> @YungBubby the fuck do you mean? cmon B ruh 
[22:29] <yungbubby> im saying 

[22:29] <bfl_griffon> if they make full dive vr like in sword art online i would be a day one adopter 
[22:29] <yungbubby> i spend time with my anime wife 
[22:29] <yungbubby> and we do things 

[22:29] <baddyrio3000> highly doubt it emits any dangerous radiation lol 
[22:29] <conan_the_barbarian> his VR thing he did with Res 7 was funny though 
[22:30] <bfl_griffon> @baddyrio3000 youre probably right 
[22:30] <pinkdam> @dingusmasterl you wanted to be ruined? 

[22:30] <neospartanhesperos9> @YungBubby You sick mother fucker.. cmonBruh 
[22:30] <yungbubby> how 

[22:30] <dingusmasterl> @DarksydePhil what were your dreams 
[22:30] <yungbubby> explain how im sick 
[22:30] <dingusmasterl> @Pinkdam what ? 

[22:30] <iradiumviking> pretty lucky to have an anime wife thouhg 
[22:30] <hairoftehdog> VR is good for novelty games. Job simulator was the peak of VR 
[22:30] <neospartanhesperos9> @YungBubby beating off to cartoons? DAFUQ?! cmon B ruh 
[22:30] <bfl_griffon> if i could fuck anime girls in vr i would never leave 

[22:30] <yaanul> @YungBubby You can’t just do things with your anime wife; she has to start as your anime 
girlfriend first. 

[22:30] <yungbubby> it is pretty sweet 

[22:30] <conan_the_barbarian> did he ever play job simulator?? 

[22:30] <hairoftehdog> yup 

[22:31] <yaanul> And even then, it's better to begin as anime childhood friends. 

[22:31] <yungbubby> we are married @Yaanul 

[22:31] <dingusmasterl> did dsp ever say WHY he broke up with pandaqueef 

[22:31] <dingusmasterl> badum tsss 

[22:31] <yungbubby> she started out as my gf 

[22:31] <hairoftehdog> watch his vlogs 

[22:31] <eternia_forever> @BFL_Griffon search out the Ready Player 1 trailer

[22:31] <yungbubby> but then we fell madly in love after i got my vr headset 
[22:31] <neospartanhesperos9> @Primernova yup 



[22:31] <yaanul> @YungBubby Not good enough. You should have been childhood friends. 

[22:31] <iradiumviking> No matter how insane you are. If you can have a real relationship with something 
animated... What drugs are you on? 

[22:31] <dingusmasterl> which vlogs ? 

[22:31] <hairoftehdog> pretty much ANY of his recent ones on Kingofhate 
[22:31] <yungbubby> how can we have done that her anime is only like3 years old 
[22:31] <dingusmasterl> to find out about queef 

[22:31] <bfl_griffon> @eternia_forever i would ne all over that shit, if its better than real life then why bother 
with real life 

[22:31] <popsicolo> You guys talking about vr? popsicSmug

[22:33] <iradiumviking> according to legend japan surrendered to the americans not because of the nukes but 
because they didn’t want a war with russia 

[22:33] <hairoftehdog> good to know that in the apocolypse, theyll be plenty of guns in EVERY hoiuse, and 
dune buggys everywhere

[22:49] <tormentedmayhem 17> Phil never wants to light. 

[22:49] <memekar> you can increase your odds by looting and hiding from everyone but in can lead to being 
horribly under geared depending where you go. 

[22:49] <hairoftehdog> phil didnt like you insulting the great kojima 
[22:49] <conan_the_barbarian> @BFL_Griffon is that true? 

[22:49] <steveofhouse> i think it would be cool if there was a game mode where the map ever shrinks, there’d be 
like 8 hour matches. 

[22:49] <heybosspossi> but you havw to phil you’re contractually obligated 

[22:50] <emryl> that guy sucks

those you kill. Om good games i get about 5 kills and have significantly better loot at the end 

[22:51] <neospartanhesperos9> @MasterSaruwatari It depends on the scenario

[22:53] <mastersaruwatari> @Soup_GG not that hard when you can hide for most of the game.He also thinks he 
isn't good at the game.

[22:57] <mastersaruwatari> that's all i know. 

[22:58] <mastersaruwatari> my singing helped phil get out of the blast zone.
