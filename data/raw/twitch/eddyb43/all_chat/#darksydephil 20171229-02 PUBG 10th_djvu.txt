[20:43] <jannedaarcl35> cheerlO Isn’t swatting a felony already? Or it hasn't reached that point yet? 

[20:43] <pwnage_101> That is why I am asking Phil since it is his Patreon.

a bbq Phil ? cheer50 lol 

[20:43] <neospartanhesperos9> @britz94xd I would’ve thought it was a flamethrower Kappa 
[20:43] <skooma_dealer> phil you never expanded on how your parents are in your Christmas stream 
[20:43] <pinkdam> you'd think in america where guns are legal people wouldn't be shot for suspectedly holding 
one 

[20:43] <skooma_dealer> are they ok 

[20:43] <hidden_baiken> even if you don’t like Phil’s stuff you should agree having him SWATTED was terrible 
and wrong

[21:36] <hidden_baiken> Is this game even finished? 

[21:36] <hoboxl0> not at all 

[21:36] <primernova> 5.56 is faster ammo and less bullet drop, the AK is still pretty good though 
[21:36] <hoboxl0> the developers for this game are complete retards 

[21:36] <ihav4gotn> im bored of every game guys, should i play civilization? ResidentSleeper 
[21:36] <hidden_baiken> I thought so

[21:38] <mikehuntthedestroyer> I thought Phil said he didnt knwo how much the goal was 



[21:38] <bentboxer> some people say the scar is the best 
[21:38] <jannedaarcl35> He was close though 

[21:38] <44kpanda> cheerlO The Scar's stats appear to be worse, but it's definitely better; however, the AKM 
kills quicker if you can manage the recoil. Still, the Scar is probably what you should stick with even over the 
M4. 

[21:38] <two_bar_king> GG wish i had more desposible income
