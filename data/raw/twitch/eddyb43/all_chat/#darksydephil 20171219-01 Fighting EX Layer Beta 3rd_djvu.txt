[11:50] <aes0411> cheer 10 I'll ask it as genuinely as I can — when you play a fighting game online, how do you 
know when the opponent is mashing buttons or does a "random supper"? It could be the case where the opponent 
is mashing, but it could be good timing.

[12:10] <londorgael> cheerlO honest question, but why don’t you sell some stuff? Sell your switch, maybe sell 
your iphone for a bit of money and buy a burner phone, or just general gaming accessories? Temporary measures 
to make sure you get some cash to keep your place for the beginning of the year. Once you're past that (+after 
getting your bits 2 months later), you can get a switch again if you really want it.

However, do you really think your PSVR or Switch or iPhone won't help you out? There aren't any significant 
games coming out for the Switch that youd play cause of the ad rev being taken by nintendo. You're asking for

[12:49] <sanyal627> ??? LUL 



[12:49] <d2tz> PogChamp 

[12:50] <bobbi_ling> is this a kof wannabe dspHmm 

[12:50] <kekon3> QCF KK is Triple Break. You don't need to time Heavy Justice Fist after Triple Break. Allen’s 

Universal Overhead will actually miss against crouching opponents if you're too close. Also, guard break is a 

mini stun, you can actually set in whatever combo you want if you land it 

[12:50] <sanyal627> conjulate??? LUL 

[12:50] <fhrffymoochicken> he can play any style he wants 

[12:50] <fluffymoochicken> yep 

[12:50] <bethelewd> bobbi no its a SF wannabe 

[12:50] <mudai> it's too bad that this game will stay a niche game under fighting games, it seems cool, and the sf 
ex games were better than their reputation too 
[12:50] <bobbi_ling> looks closer to kof 
[12:51] <fluffymoochicken> super broken lol 

[12:51] <bethelewd> bobbi the original was called street fighter ex layer

[12:51] <kekon3> there's enough time to dash in 

[12:52] <dweebenheimer20> hes also got the best engrish 

[12:52] <sanyal627> lets go 

[12:52] <kekon3> only downside is he doesn't have an antiair normal 
[12:52] <bethelewd> online hype 
[12:52] <kekon3> thats literally it 
[12:52] <sanyal627> LETS GO

[13:09] <mudai> I love the salt but man Phil is a bad loser sometimes... I never saw him going "gg, the other guy 
just played better" 

[13:09] <vendatus> Allen says "I am Dan 2" Kappa 

[13:09] <loosh> the mexicans seem to have the best connections

[13:09] <sanyal627> @Elipsion Ototoi kiyagare = basically a japanese taunt meanning he/she is too early for 
these fights (lack of skill/talent and needs to practice more) 

[13:09] <bobbMing> beth should be in this game with his silver mullet 

[13:09] <markymark52> Phil rarely ever admits when a player is better than him Mudai. 99% it's excuses why he 
loses. 

[13:09] <bethelewd> bobbi too bad 
[13:10] <elipsion> Ah gotcha 

[13:10] <retrojim_> because you don't know if a player is better than you if they won on lag @markymark52 
[13:10] <mudai> @markymark52 yeah it's kinda sad actually, that doesn't help in getting better either 
[13:10] <imaidenr> this shirase isnt very good 

[13:10] <dlmech> yeah whenever Phil is winning... there is never any lag :P 
[13:10] <mudai> yeah this Shirase is a free win

[13:11] <markymark52> @retro_jim_ Well, that just means Phil isn't good online then. Je 
[13:11] <mudai> you had the health advantage 



[13:11] <infinite_55> Nice, you rekt him!

[13:32] <mudai> @josefdabestl haha wow, I should watch that then. But yeah, that’s why doing research before 
an LP is actually handy before saying wrong stuff like he did 

[13:32] <josefdabestl> what is up with this low voice quality especially from Allen? sounds like the voice actors 
recorded it form home with webcam mic 

[13:32] <bethelewd> bobbi but the stream is way behind real time 

[13:32] <i_came_here_to_something> I hate Blanka more than I hate life itself TriHard

[13:37] <theycallmejimbob> :D Bobbi 




[13:37] <markmccauley> I have not played Street Fighter V during the last 6 months. 

[13:37] <divanerasmus> When will you take your rightful place as the Fighting EX Layer tournaments Champ ? 

[13:37] <vendatus> Use the force Kekon LUL 

[13:37] <mudai> I will jump back into SF5 next month #TeamSakura 

[13:37] <bethelewd> dspFacepahn 

[13:38] <i_came_here_to_something> @Deftonessstr Looks? Depends. SFV's got better animations. Plays? Also 
depends. They cleaned up a lot of stuff w/ SFV's input lag and certain balancing since the launch. 

[13:38] <bethelewd> even kekon dont stand a chace :( 

[13:38] <trihard41iife> if I want to get into fighting, should I wait for the new street fighter game to come out? 
complete noob btw 
[13:38] <mudai> rip kekkon 
[13:39] <bethelewd> poor kekon 

[13:39] <bobbi_Jing> what new sf game? the anniversary thing? 

[13:39] <theycallmejimbob> Kekon dspPepe 

[13:39] <josefdabestl> well they are making a SFV arcade edition perhaps that version will make it a true 

successor to SF IV who knows 

[13:39] <kekon3> fuuug 

[13:39] <bethelewd> you yried 

[13:39] <kekon3> Shirase is hard lmao Kappa 

[13:39] <vendatus> TriHard get into DBFZ instead LUL 

[13:39] <trihard41iife> hmm.. cmonBruh 

[13:39] <mudai> @TriHard4Liife honestly SF5 2 years ago was the best opportunity to jump into Street Fighter. 
But AE next month is still a good point 

[13:39] <josefdabestl> but i got my sights on Fighter Z instead that game is gonna amazing! 

[13:39] <kekon3> ggs my dude 

[13:39] <mudai> DBFZ if you like anime fighters, since that game is new everyone will start from scratch 
[13:39] <i_came_here_to_something> @TriHard4Liife If you buy SFV right now I think you get a lot of Fight 
Money and some of the AE stuff for cheap (maybe all of it). You can find deals for SFV right now and stuff for 
the Season Passes 

[13:39] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil When will you take your rightful place as the Fighting EX Layer 
tournaments Champ ? 

[13:39] <bethelewd> i played as all 6 chars in this beta and i only like skullo and damn :D 
[13:40] <epicblazel3> LUL 

[13:40] <trihard41iife> @I_Came_Here_To_Something people still playing?

[13:40] <elzorrobot> PhilKryptonite 
[13:40] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[13:40] <yolodopper> cheer 10 this game is a poor mans version of sfv 

[13:40] <i_came_here_to_something> @TriHard4Liife Of course. They just finished Capcom Cup earlier this 
month, the new AE trailers were very well-received. 

[13:40] <fluttershyl970> mrsvYATTA 



[13:40] <bethelewd> bobbi i do like fighting games but i know i am absolute SHIT at them 
[13:41] <trihard41iife> I like dsp completely insults other players because of lag and cheap tactics lol 
[13:41] <two_bar_king> kick his ass phil 

[13:41] <mudai> I just wish we could live in a world were we don't have to insult others just because they have a 
shitty internet connection... 

[13:41] <theycallmejimbob> that damage dspEw 

[13:41] <vendatus> Sora playing a fighting game waiting for KH3 release LUL 
[13:41] <markmccauley> Will SFV:AE still have 8 frames of lag? 

[13:41] <josefdabestl> i feel bad for Phil he's gonna be so lost when he plays kingdom hearts 3 he's missed out 

on 5 games leading up to 3 lmao 

[13:41] <rx93gundamm> rekt phil 

[13:41] <josefdabestl> that damage man damn 

[13:41] <bobbi_ling> it doesnt have 8 frames delay right now 

[13:41] <bethelewd> damn that damage 

[13:41] <elzorrobot> master tactic 

[13:41] <rx93gundamm> he t bagged at the end HAHA 

[13:41] <mudai> I'm seriously sick of people on Twitch and pretty much everywhere insulting others for 
nothing. There's so much bad in this world, so many shitty people, who get pass, but because you have a laggy 
connection you’re an "asshole" and a "fucking idiot"? 

[13:42] <i_came_here_to_something> @Markmccauley No. and currently SFV has something like 6 or 5. 
There's 4 frames Capcom can’t do anything about b/c Epic's Unreal Engine 4 has that built in and they have to 
release a patch mid next-year to fix it. 

[13:42] <markmccauley> @Bobbi_Ling 0 frames of lag? 

[13:42] <channel33> LUL 
[13:42] <focusdakid> lol

[13:43] <eyesonwater> kh3 will never get released because of this guy 
[13:43] <josefdabestl> that damage is just insane 



[13:43] <mudai> I mean he could call him out on the tea bagging and I would understand if he would call him a 
jerk beacuse of that, but not because of the internet connection... 

[13:43] <bethelewd> my order of best till worse in this game so far is Skullo, Damn, Allen, Kairi, gurada and 
shirase 

[13:43] <markymark52> cheerlO Owned. Flawless connection and Evo worthy skills by Sorakeyblade.

[13:44] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil can you put on your cowboy hat? plz 

[13:45] <i_came_here_to_something> @Markmccauley Ah, cool. Yeah man, whenever you fire it up again, you 
aught to see what changes they made to the cast balance and input lag reduction. It’s improved since launch. 
[13:45] <markymark52> Kyrie Irving. 

[13:45] <theycallmejimbob> you got this Kekon3 VoHiYo

[13:45] <bethelewd> now kairi 

[13:45] <channel33> of all the games i should keep on my hd which should it be: injustice 2, SF5, or tekken 7 

[13:46] <deftonessstr> he jumped 

[13:46] <mudai> tekken 7 and sf5 @Channel33 

[13:46] <bethelewd> bobbi it takes like 5-10 mins to get a match sometimes :D 



[13:46] <channel33> (nod) 

[13:46] <channel33> i think sf5 might have a comeback 
[13:46] <vendatus> Injus 2 for Ninja Turtles LUL 

[13:46] <mudai> I know I will install SF5 again to prepare myself for Sakura 
[13:46] <deftonessstr> dude %60 damage is not broken in any game 
[13:46] <bobbMing> sakura x blanka 
[13:46] <mudai> hell yeah 

[13:46] <i_came_here_to_something> @Channel33 Depends on what you’re looking for. SFV's not nearly as bad 
as Phil says it is, Tekken 7 has a good number of players around, and Injustice 2 just won Fighting Game of the 
Year at the Game Awards Kappa 

[13:47] <josefdabestl> @Channel33 if you want a casual fighter that doesen't have much depth or much of a 
learning curve Injustice 2 if you want a serious fighter that requires a ton of time investment with a big learning 
curve then Tekken 7 for SFV idk haven't played it 

[13:47] <mudai> Injustice 2 only won that because of its Story Mode Kappa 
[13:47] <deftonessstr> SFV is just bad...thats all...No need to talk about it 

[13:47] <josefdabestl> @I_Came_Here_To_Something pffft are you serious!? Injustice 2 is an unbalanced mess 
[13:47] <channel33> SF5 is downloading its 25% 

[13:47] <channel33> Arcade edition might just pull it off 

[13:47] <mudai> I love how Phil said we’re not talking about anything, meanwhile the whole chat is talking 
about fighting games... #bubble 

[13:47] <josefdabestl> spam Superman's heat vision and win there is literally nothing your opponent can do 
unreal man 

[13:48] <goldencolts> dont read cheer cheerl5 
[13:48] <bethelewd> who won that match kekon or phil? 

[13:48] <mudai> phil 
[13:48] <wxrxaxtxh> Kekon 
[13:48] <bethelewd> typical 

[13:48] <i_came_here_to_something> @mudai Yeah, i think that’s obvious LUL . @josefdabestl I don’t follow 
the game at all so I guess you might be right on that 

[13:48] <rx93gundamm> @mudai That isnt true phil is making random noises 

[13:48] <kekon3> Rude Kappa 

[13:48] <bethelewd> kekon letting me down again 

[13:48] <deftonessstr> @Channel33 There’s no EDITION can save SFV being trash... The core game and 
netcode is shit and nothing can fix that 
[13:48] <channel33> :/ 

[13:48] <mudai> @rx93gundamm LUL 
[13:48] <bloodmoonthx> helloooo 
[13:48] <rx93gundamm> i am not a childrens entertainer 
[13:48] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello BloodMoonThx 

[13:48] <i_came_here_to_something> @Deftonessstr That’s just...your opinion, man :/ 

[13:48] <channel33> but it’s the only fighter that has a big community where i can get matches whenever i want 

[13:49] <channel33> and on a yearly basis 

[13:49] <deftonessstr> There’s NO OPINION on SFV being trash 

[13:49] <sensfan42> is phil playing on a gamepad? 

[13:49] <deftonessstr> its a FACT 

[13:49] <vendatus> Kekon just win a round Kappa 

[13:49] <mudai> stick 

[13:49] <josefdabestl> @I_Came_Here_To_Something trust me Injustice 2 is one of my most regretful 
purchases ever i will NEVER buy a game from netherealms again they cannot make a fighting game 0 balance 
no care was put into balancing and fair game they put most of their efforts into it's story mode which was good 
but after that you got nothing to do since the netcode is garbage aswell overall a terribble game to play online 
[13:49] <bloodmoonthx> wth is this game 



[13:49] <josefdabestl> hopefully Fighter Z won't end up the same way 
[13:49] <bethelewd> kekon who you gunna try next skullo or damn :D 
[13:49] <theycallmejimbob> he did it VoHiYo 

[13:49] <channel33> skullo is love skullo is life skullomania is runnign wild 
[13:49] <bethelewd> after you lose this :D 

[13:50] <i_came_here_to_something> @Channel33 It’s just one guy’s opinion and imho it’s a faulty one. Have 
an open mind and try it yourself, and see how you feel about it. If it’s not the game for you you can still try stuff 
like Tekken 7 (tho it has a steeper learning curve) 

[13:50] <josefdabestl> dude Injustice 2 has massive chip damage just show you how little the developers cared 
[13:50] <infinite_55> Hey Phil, how is the stream thus far? holidaycheerlOO 
[13:50] <vendatus> now win again LUL 

[13:50] <channel33> I like sf5 but its fatal flaw is the limited offline experience 
[13:50] <channel33> that survival mode 
[13:51] <theycallmejimbob> ul Kekon3 dspPepe 
[13:51] <kekon3> lmao 

[13:51] <hobbsl017> whats dsp’s overall record 

[13:51] <i_came_here_to_something> @josefdabestl thankfully it wasn’t really on my radar. Looked good at 
launch tho, great production values I just don’t like the NRS style of fighting games :/ 

[13:51] <elzorrobot> Phil I’ll play with you when Soul Calibur 6 comes out if you get in for PS4 
[13:51] <bobbi_ling> who cares about offline modes in a fighting game? i know i dont

[13:51] <vendatus> rip Kekon 

[13:51] <rx93gundamm> fighting against the guy whos runing the stream is more entertaining than watching 
kekon. hes terrible. 

[13:51] <josefdabestl> @I_Came_Here_To_Something you made a good choice outside the story mode and 
graphics Injustice 2 is just an overall ugly game to play if you catch my drift 
[13:51] <vendatus> LUL 

[13:51] <elzorrobot> even though I suck at fighting games 
[13:51] <kekon3> @Vendatus I won that one round for you

you can do to earn Fight Money.

[15:32] <retrojim_> didnt @cammyowns just say "Phil being a bully" I'm pretty sure that was a joke 
[15:32] <darkvikingl59> 1 the opponent accepted the rematch and second the other guy can learn from phils 
moves 

[15:32] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil's got a pepe in his throat 
[15:32] <mastersaruwatari> also everyone deserves a rematch. 

[15:32] <jbbaxter98> @Ambient_Green yeah same 
[15:32] <mastersaruwatari> no matter if they are good or bad. 

[15:32] <mastersaruwatari> I don’t see how he is being a bully.

[15:46] <hindae> Speaking of KOTOR are you aware they updated KOTOR2 very recently? 

[15:46] <bobbi_ling> lol 

[15:46] <mastersaruwatari> It will be op as fuck if he adds Beerus or Hit to his team. 

[15:46] <kozatof> @hindae really 

[15:46] <kekon3> lol and I stopped playijng too 

[15:46] <kekon3> though I'm a boosted ass Allen main lmao 

[15:46] <iradiumviking> I played through kotor but when playing kotor2 i felt it was the exact same game 
[15:46] <doctorzzz> they should add toppo too 

[15:47] <kingofhypocrisy> @HinDae didn’t they just add achievements 

[15:47] <bethefueg> beerus is too technical a fighter for phil to master 

[15:47] <doctorzzz> big grappler toppo 

[15:47] <kinggoken> i wanna see Jiren and Toppo in FighterZ 

[15:47] <bethefueg> hit would be OP 

[15:47] <bobbi_ling> i liked kotor 1 better 

[15:47] <kekon3> lemine get back on I guess 

[15:47] <mastersaruwatari> Beerus don’t look that technical. 

[15:47] <kozatof> @iradiumviking you has to get restored content mod 
[15:47] <hindae> And some content that coincided with a major mod 

[15:47] <kingofhypocrisy> Kotor 2 is bugged on windows 10, i can’t play it anymore when it was fine on 7 
[15:47] <doctorzzz> he is not you need to watch super 
[15:47] <doctorzzz> LUL 

[15:47] <kinggoken> dsp brings up a good point about Beerus 
[15:47] <encelor> king xeno or zeno is the boss 

[15:47] <fluffymoochicken> @DarksydePhil will you ever make sonic unleashed a patreon goal? 

[15:47] <mastersaruwatari> phil makes a good point. 

[15:47] <psyoctopi> no whis is stronger 

[15:48] <kinggoken> Beerus is a monster. No one is stronger than him 

[15:48] <bethefueg> that orb move and how he manipulates it seems technical 

[15:48] <kinggoken> in Univesrse 7 

[15:48] <superslygaming> im the bouse TriHard 

[15:48] <bethefueg> Whis is stronger than Beerus 

[15:48] <doctorzzz> goku with ultra would woop beerus ass 

[15:48] <kinggoken> welh.i guess Whis is stronger 

[15:48] <doctorzzz> and whis is the strongest 

[15:48] <i8_nexus> Goku is a bitch 

[15:48] <mastersaruwatari> Goku Black has a command grab. 

[15:48] <i_came_here_to_something> Whis is the strongest? Doesn’t look like it but then again it's DB 
[15:48] <rukiaxplaynetwork> lol I just found a hacker 

[15:48] <encelor> super saiyan powers have been nerfed in the new dragon ball series 

[15:48] <kinggoken> yeah Whis can own beerus 

[15:48] <fluffymoochicken> dragon ball super is not good btw :( 

[15:49] <mis_diego> @rukiaxplaynetwork where 
[15:49] <rukiaxplaynetwork> no its not 
[15:49] <rukiaxplaynetwork> in this gamw 
[15:49] <bobbi_ling> chiaotzu is stronger than beerus 
[15:49] <rukiaxplaynetwork> game 
[15:49] <bethefueg> whis mops the floor with Beerus 
[15:49] <kinggoken> dragon ball super is TIGHT 
[15:49] <doctorzzz> what ? super is really good 



[15:49] <chairmancaleb> Super has its moments, but overall, it's not that great. 

[15:49] <bobbi_ling> in the cuteness category LUL 
[15:49] <mastersaruwatari> yeah it's not that great. 

[15:49] <hiddenninjablade> Don’t remind me of that tingly feeling crap 
[15:49] <encelor> they made super sayain powers weak 
[15:49] <kekon3> well, I got a match, but it wasn't you 
[15:49] <mis_diego> super is overrated 

[15:49] <markymark52> cheer50 when you get some extra money you should invest in the new Dual Shock 
Model. You can have the option to do wired connectivity. 

[15:49] <bethefueg> Super is pretty good 

[15:49] <mis_diego> it's ass 

[15:49] <rukiaxplaynetwork> dbzs is not that bad 

[15:49] <dmgdealer92> Oh tingly feelings it's bullshit 

[15:49] <kinggoken> lol the animation is bad most of the time 

[15:49] <coralguy> nothing beats the fireiza saga 

[15:49] <bethefueg> the latest episodes have been amazing 

[15:49] <mis_diego> yeah it looks terrible 

[15:49] <megarager> Super is good. It’s just not DBZ, so yeah. 

[15:49] <rukiaxplaynetwork> there trolling u 

[15:49] <kinggoken> yeah it does have bad animation. Only thing i do n’t like about super 
[15:49] <dmgdealer92> Animation has gotten better 
[15:49] <megarager> Animation has gotten a bit better. 

[15:49] <mastersaruwatari> I am behind on super dub. 

[15:50] <doctorzzz> the animations got redone mostly 

[15:50] <fluffymoochicken> it is really boring right now, a lame tournament with lots of throwaway villains 

that's lasting like 30+ episodes 

[15:50] <mastersaruwatari> i need t ocatch up. 

[15:50] <rukiaxplaynetwork> yeah 

[15:50] <i_came_here_to_something> DBZ looks better than DBS; it's the art direction that's the issue 

[15:50] <bethefueg> animation is better 

[15:50] <mis_diego> generic anime soundtrack 

[15:50] <great27> Are you getting Dragonball Fighterz DSP? 

[15:50] <rukiaxplaynetwork> it don't look good lol 

[15:50] <encelor> super sayain instinct almost lost to a super sayain 1 fusion 
[15:50] <bobbi_ling> og dragonball > z 
[15:50] <fluffymoochicken> YES, exactly DSP 
[15:50] <encelor> fking ass 

[15:50] <kushiyakitori> there are very little "villains" 

[15:50] <i_came_here_to_something> DBZ has better choreographed fights. 

[15:50] <mis_diego> uninspired characters 

[15:50] <rukiaxplaynetwork> lol cant find any one lol 

[15:50] <i_came_here_to_something> YuYu's better than DBZ 

[15:50] <doctorzzz> dragon ball z dragged way more than super lol 

[15:50] <kushiyakitori> in thr tournament at least 

[15:50] <chairmancaleb> Super was never even supposed to exist, so...lol. 

[15:50] <encelor> YuYu is lOOOx better than dragon ball super 
[15:51] <doctorzzz> cell and buu saga went on forever 
[15:51] <superslygaming> everyone went back to tekken Kappa 
[15:51] <encelor> new super sayain thing is crap 

[15:51] <coralguy> my favorite anime movies are akira and ghost in the shell 

[15:51] <chairmancaleb> Toriyama giving the greenlight to Super was a questionable decision for fans, but an 
amazing decision for making money. 



[15:51] <mastersaruwatari> cheer25 Have you seen anything from My Hero Academia yet? I think you will 
really like it. Same goes for Hunter x Hunter. From the same guy who does Yu Yu. 

[15:51] <bethefueg> i like Super but to each their own

[15:51] <stevewebbw> VoHiYo 

[15:52] <kinggoken> anyone think Jiren is too over powered? 

[15:52] <bobbi_ling> RaccAttack KonCha 

[15:52] <encelor> how does a super saiyan blue get ass wooped by super saiyan 1 fusion like come the fuck on 
[15:52] <encelor> makes no ense 

[15:52] <hiddenninjablade> That reminds me, doesn't Gon’s dad look like Yuksuke? 

[15:52] <thatanonyraccoon> tsosHi @Bobbi_Ling panda wave 

[15:52] <mastersaruwatari> @Bobbi_Ling fews eps behind the dub. I am loving the arc the arc the dub is on 
though. 

[15:52] <kinggoken> Fusions have ridiculous high power levels 
[15:52] <thatanonyraccoon> no panda :( 

[15:52] <kushiyakitori> SS transformations are multipliers 

[15:52] <kinggoken> remember when goten and trunks fused and they could easily go ssj3? 

[15:52] <mastersaruwatari> was that suppose to be a match? 

[15:52] <doctorzzz> they were super sayan 2 tho both 
[15:52] <encelor> gogeta fusion was ass 
[15:52] <tsuwugi> box 

[15:52] <encelor> compared to tourney fusion 
[15:52] <bethefueg> gogeta is non canon 
[15:52] <encelor> and trunks and his super saiyan sword 
[15:52] <bobbi_ling> why no panda GiftRage 
[15:52] <encelor> gogeta 

[15:52] <mis_diego> Inuyashiki looks amazing tho 

[15:52] <hiddenninjablade> @kinggoken remember when Goten and Trunks were relevent? 

[15:53] <coralguy> sweep the legg 

[15:53] <kushiyakitori> the movie next year will explain super saiyan power and origin more 
[15:53] <thatanonyraccoon> rip Panda RaccAttack 
[15:53] <kinggoken> yes. a long time ago lol 
[15:53] <mastersaruwatari> oh yeah a move. 

[15:53] <bobbi_ling> whic arc is the dub on master? 

[15:53] <datoneguyweallknow> wow dood 
[15:53] <superslygaming> u must never forget 
[15:53] <encelor> i mean the earring fusion 
[15:53] <great27> this is a good match. 

[15:53] <bethefueg> oh vegito 

[15:53] <dukaduka> @KushiYakitori it better not be mitochondrians 
[15:53] <doctorzzz> potara is vegito 

[15:53] <mastersaruwatari> @Bobbi_Ling Greed island. It should be done with ti by now and starting up the 
next one. 

[15:53] <encelor> earring fusion blue seemed weaker then the tourney chick ssj 1 



[15:53] <encelor> yeah vegito 

[15:53] <kushiyakitori> @dukaduka it pretty much is. they have already talked about s-cells 

[15:53] <madibased> god damn phils getting better at this stuff 

[15:53] <kinggoken> i agree @encelor 

[15:54] <encelor> lets not forget trunk's ssjl sword 

[15:54] <doctorzzz> im pretty sure kale and cauli were both ssj2 encelor 

[15:54] <encelor> LU1 

[15:54] <dukaduka> @KushiYakitori i was joking NotLikeThis 
[15:54] <mastersaruwatari> now we got a match. 

[15:54] <encelor> i saw no lighting 

[15:54] <kushiyakitori> @dukaduka LUL my bad 

[15:54] <superslygaming> Fighting games are hard :( 

[15:54] <rukiaxplaynetwork> yep 
[15:54] <encelor> was only yellow aura 

[15:54] <bethefueg> ita€™s just the artists direction lol ita€™s hard to make relevant enemies when they made 

Goku a fucking God 

[15:54] <kinggoken> kale looked ssj 1 

[15:55] <encelor> was trunk's sword ssj blue sword or just regular ssj LUL 

[15:55] <doctorzzz> cauli was definetly ssj2 in my book 

[15:55] <mis_diego> super was a mistake 

[15:55] <doctorzzz> the hair changed too 

[15:55] <bethefueg> she went LSSJ 2 when they fused 

[15:55] <zekereds29> A 

[15:55] <dukaduka> dragon ball has always had a power level issue, it's worse than one piece, but better than 
bleach 

[15:55] <mastersaruwatari> good move! 

[15:55] <kinggoken> i’m surprised Cauli didn’t go ssj3.1 was expecting that and would have rolled my eyes if i 
saw that. 

[15:55] <mastersaruwatari> this is a match! 

[15:55] <datoneguyweallknow> Final round baby 
[15:55] <mastersaruwatari> let's go! 

[15:55] <zekereds29> Super is bad imo 
[15:55] <superslygaming> chip damage dvvt 
[15:55] <dukaduka> @zekereds29 it's not bad, but it's another GT 
[15:55] <rukiaxplaynetwork> wow

[15:56] <mastersaruwatari> nice move!

[15:56] <mastersaruwatari> good fight. 

[15:56] <kushiyakitori> trunks was in SS ikari. fine to have issues with it but it wasn't 1 
[15:56] <bethefueg> @encelor that may have been the worst thing is Super yet 
[15:56] <hiddenninjablade> DAMN that was clutch 



[15:56] <encelor> wait that character model 

[15:56] <dukaduka> hey super and gt both have good moments, but are rough

[15:58] <mastersaruwatari> @encelor she's shorter than her though. 

[15:58] <encelor> you can scale things 

[15:58] <mastersaruwatari> i play DOA. I would know. 

[15:58] <encelor> LU 
[15:58] <encelor> LUL 

[15:58] <mastersaruwatari> also she has always looked like that. 

[15:58] <mastersaruwatari> so i don’t see the issue. 

[15:58] <stevewebbw> Phils daddy i want too see the pugh stream tonight 
[15:59] <bobbi_ling> they announced the end of doa TearGlove 



[15:59] <encelor> oh no not DoA voleyball 

[15:59] <fluffymoochicken> @Bobbi_Ling is that true? 

[15:59] <hiddenninjablade> Well shit 

[15:59] <encelor> Rip Ryu hayabusa and hayate 

[15:59] <divanerasmus> bring the tits @encelor 

[15:59] <bobbi_ling> yeah said they want to do other projects 

[15:59] <sgt_blackjack> yeah they announced the death a few days ago after like a $5000 or $10000 tournament 
[15:59] <amisbro> damn we got a lot of sales going on 
[16:00] <mastersaruwatari> wait what? 

[16:00] <mastersaruwatari> death of DOA? 

[16:00] <bobbi_ling> yes 

[16:00] <mastersaruwatari> i thought they meant they were moving on from 5 to work on 6. 

[16:00] <fhiffymoochicken> doa is doa :( 

[16:00] <mastersaruwatari> guessing extreme bombing didn't help. 

[16:00] <dweebenheimer20> RIP DOA 

[16:00] <amisbro> Square Enix store has Agents of Mayhem and Just Cause 3 are on sale right now and even 
Everybody's Golf is on sale right now 

[16:00] <bobbi_ling> theres still a chance 6 will come out but not anytime soon 
[16:00] <sgt_blackjack> doubt that, they didn’t mention any DOA6 and the atmosphere was really sad 
[16:00] <mastersaruwatari> and people realizing for a third time the series is just not good. Xtreme beach 
volleyball that is. 

[16:00] <great27> So when Shirace wins she says "that's enough son". 

[16:01] <encelor> what about DoA Voley ball 3 
[16:01] <encelor> :( 

[16:01] <mastersaruwatari> let me get this straight. 

[16:01] <encelor> mah booby bounce mechanics 

[16:01] <mastersaruwatari> they wasted 5 years with nonstop die costumes. 

[16:01] <encelor> my hero academia is awesome 

[16:01] <mastersaruwatari> getting sponsorships and promotion deals out of the ass. 

[16:01] <kekon3> you'd like it Phil, it's anime Xmen 

[16:01] <dweebenheimer20> Love Yuyu Hakusho 

[16:01] <mastersaruwatari> and they are ending DOA? Just like that. 

[16:01] <superslygaming> weebs unite TehePelo 
[16:01] <datoneguyweallknow> Heading out guys peace 
[16:02] <darkvikingl59> Yeah you can spend over a grand on die on doa 
[16:02] <kushiyakitori> the creator of yyh did mha? 

[16:02] <rukiaxplaynetwork> its a good anime 

[16:02] <kekon3> in all honesty, as it is the game looks like it'll at least play alright offline, but I’d lower the 

amount of throw invincibility after a block, and there needs to be more reason to not just use Miracle. muxylO 

[16:02] <eyesonwater> we need a new virtua fighter i miss my jacky "its like your moving in slow motion!" 

[16:02] <rukiaxplaynetwork> gg 

[16:02] <encelor> @DatoneGuyWeAllknow cya bro 

[16:02] <kinggoken> anime x men. Pretty good description 

[16:02] <mastersaruwatari> anime X-Men is a fair comparison. 

[16:02] <mastersaruwatari> the creator loves marvel. 

[16:02] <dweebenheimer20> doesnt x-men already have an anime? 

[16:02] <superslygaming> phil is on fire tonight 
[16:02] <fluffymoochicken> what is anime xmen? 

[16:02] <chairmancaleb> @KushiYakitori No, he mentioned that HxH is also good, and that's the same guy who 
dod Yu Yu. Phil just skimmed that part of the cheer. 

[16:02] <superslygaming> shirasa meta op 

[16:02] <dweebenheimer20> @fluffymoochicken what is a man? 



[16:02] <mastersaruwatari> 40 games over 500. 

[16:02] <encelor> united states of SMaaaaaaaSHHH - A1 Might 
[16:03] <mastersaruwatari> i wonder if there will be a, THIYDP" of this? 

[16:03] <encelor> defo 

[16:03] <rukiaxplaynetwork> that's 3 

[16:03] <kushiyakitori> @ChairmanCaleb okay, gotcha, thanks for the clarification 
[16:03] <gutty333> view count 333 

[16:03] <mastersaruwatari> i remember when phil did his second run of Dragonball Fighter Z. 

[16:03] <kozatof> muxy 10 

[16:03] <mastersaruwatari> and none of the haters said anything. 

[16:03] <kinggoken> kamehameha!! Can’t wait for Dragon Ball FighterZ 

[16:03] <kingofhypocrisy> @MasterSaruwatari those nudnik detractors have no fuckin self control 

[16:03] <fluffymoochicken> dsp is doing fine overall i think 

[16:04] <kozatof> @kingofhypocrisy dspHinm 

[16:04] <encelor> i think detractors do more salt vids then TIHYDP 

[16:04] <encelor> lately 

[16:04] <mastersaruwatari> @KingOfHypocrisy lol i just notice if he is doing well they say nothing. 

[16:04] <captainkirk221> phil is a beast tonight 5Y™, 

[16:04] <petulant_stephen> Did anyl masturbate today 
[16:04] <encelor> my dog humped a leg or 2 at work LUL 
[16:04] <bobbi_ling> cmonBruh 

[16:04] <thatanonyraccoon> when MVC:I first came out, a "salt" vid of DSP playing it was one of the top results 
[16:05] <mastersaruwatari> when did he stop playing mvci? 

[16:05] <mastersaruwatari> i know he hated it. 

[16:05] <gutty333> so if Phil plays Dragon Ball FighterZ online and he faces a captain ginyu that does body 
change on him in a game changing moment, will he blame, the game makers or akira toriyama for creating that 
move 

[16:05] <kingofhypocrisy> @kozatof CarlSmile 
[16:05] <mastersaruwatari> he wasn’t half bad at it. 

[16:05] <mrkarlsync> So this chick is supposed to be a mix of Ibuki and Chun right? 

[16:05] <encelor> helena character model Kappa 

[16:05] <mastersaruwatari> @Gutty333 no one because that level 3 is fucking ass. 

[16:05] <kekon3> @gutty333 if body swap happens, who gets the lag? 

[16:06] <mastersaruwatari> @MrKarlSync ibuki and feiling for me. 

[16:06] <channel33> hed get jumped 
[16:06] <bobbi_ling> lol 

[16:06] <channel33> and the whoopin would be filmed and put on the internet 
[16:06] <mastersaruwatari> feilong*

[16:17] <kozatof> @themikemaverickag did phil unblock you 

[16:17] <dweebenheimer20> he also created Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting

[16:17] <jbbaxter98> who else gets an insane amount of belly button fuzz 
[16:17] <eyesonwater> good sport mike 

[16:17] <mastersaruwatari> @dweebenheimer20 he is a fighting game god then. 

[16:17] <gamerzillal001> Resortimg to repetitive tactics to win rather than being adaptive and open in a fight is 
what typically gets players defeated 

[16:18] <wxrxaxtxh> wheres the homie sorenkey when you need him 
[16:18] <encelor> i have not heard of that game since the xbox 
[16:18] <encelor> LU1

[16:18] <mastersaruwatari> progressive really works for me. 

[16:18] <mastersaruwatari> 90-26. 

[16:18] <kozatof> 53 losses? 

[16:18] <kozatof> Lmao 

[16:18] <jo_bolt> First game where Phil rules! 

[16:18] <mastersaruwatari> jesus that is a lot. 

[16:18] <gezoral999> does Phil identify as a progressive 
[16:18] <bethefueg> yea this games dead 

[16:19] <yolodopper> cheer50 hey phil i just broke up with my fiance of 6 months, it was arranged marriage type 
so not a biggy 

[16:19] <patrickbl973> overhere we always get a notification on how much tax we have to pay. don’t they do 
that where he lives ? 

[16:19] <stratmanl909> maybe they played against really good people 
[16:19] <mastersaruwatari> @Gezoral999 talking about the control setting. 

[16:19] <eyesonwater> seems he avoiding the zoning maybe doesnt wanna be cheap 

[16:19] <mastersaruwatari> @yolodopper uh...where are you from? If you don’t mind me asking. 

[16:19] <gamerzillal001> wow phil has definantly improved rather than accuse the game on being broken or 
blaming bad luck he seems to genuinly push himself to improve and overcome his downfalla its good to see that 
[16:20] <gezoral999> @Patrickbl973 he won't know the total amount until January when taxes are due for 2017 
[16:20] <gutty333> so when you break up with a fiance do they give the ring back? 



[16:20] <patrickbl973> ok 

[16:20] <mastersaruwatari> @Gamerzillal001 Helps when he played the EX series before. 

[16:20] <encelor> @Gutty333 nah they pawn that shit off LUL

[16:21] <jo_bolt>? 

[16:21] <yolodopper> @MasterSaruwatari pakistan 

[16:21] <gamerzillal001> well true I feel a huge disavantage to streaming is thst you feel rushed and pushed to 
beat a game rather than take your own pace to play so a little practive before hand helps 
[16:21] <encelor> @Jo_Bolt you got to win 3/3 

[16:21] <mastersaruwatari> @yolodopper oh no wonder. You should get out of there.

[16:21] <gezoral999> pakistan is a nice country 
[16:22] <mis_diego> is it? 

[16:22] <gamerzillal001> Ive streamed before it sure stressed you out to rush and be quick in a game rather than 
practice and relax 
[16:22] <gezoral999> no 

[16:22] <encephalolz> Arranged marriages still happen in 1st world countries? 

[16:22] <gezoral999> thats why they've all invaded london 

[16:22] <encelor> how did it not work out i thought pakistani woman where obedient 

[16:22] <mastersaruwatari> arranged marriages are translations for we just want to marry with a rich family. 
[16:22] <thatanonyraccoon> I've heard bad things about Pakistan from people living in India 
[16:22] <mis_diego> oh 
[16:22] <mis_diego> true 

[16:22] <markymark52> Arrange me with Mia Khalifa. 

[16:22] <thatanonyraccoon> Pakistan is a bunch of Muslims running their own country, basically 
[16:23] <gezoral999> Phil should try an arranged marriage 
[16:23] <encelor> islam still has arranged amrriages

[16:25] <gamerzillal001> In my opinion while history marriage was intentionally designed to allow the wealthy

obligated to be with someone else and having a family should be with someone you can be happy with

[16:55] <i_came_here_to_something> When is Phil going to get back to NITW anyhow btw? 

[16:55] <theycallmejimbob> last couple of months* 

[16:55] <mastersaruwatari> cheer25 congrats on 100 wins! 

[16:55] <pcgamehunter> Precisely Jimbob GOG is like the last bastion of good game distribution 
[16:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe NITW didn’t make the running for the Christmas marathon 



[16:56] <fluffymoochicken> whats nitw 

[16:56] <encelor> i got free witcher 1-2 from playing gewnt beta way back LUL 
[16:56] <theycallmejimbob> night in the woods 

[16:56] <pcgamehunter> If GOG goes away i'm moving in to the Caribbean bay Kappa 

[16:56] <i_came_here_to_something> I just wish GOG had more games. They need Blade Runner. 

[16:56] <thatanonyraccoon> @theycallmejimbob i didn't even nominate it, he really doesn’t want to touch it 

[16:56] <encelor> got to play free game and got 2 games out of it 

[16:56] <thatanonyraccoon> such a waste 

[16:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe someday Race Attack 

[16:56] <thatanonyraccoon> i still have HOPE 

[16:56] <thatanonyraccoon> Inagito 

[16:56] <nightbot> #HopeSeedPhil #NudeForNagito 

[16:56] <robestis> Duh yea got a free copy of pacman out of it 

[16:56] <robestis> doctorPUNK 

[16:57] <pcgamehunter> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Well GOG has the no DRM policy, so if the game has 
it. The devs have to remove it before it can be put on. Also some devs like their DRM so they won’t make it either 
[16:57] <pcgamehunter> That's why new Hitman isn't on it either. That shit is like Sim City level DRM LUL 
[16:57] <encelor> Dix out for nagito 
[16:57] <dweebenheimer20> fuck DRM 

[16:57] <encelor> Denuvo seems to trigger people for some reason 
[16:57] <pcgamehunter> Also WTF nightbot you sick fuck DansGame 
[16:57] <rukiaxplaynetwork> lol 
[16:57] <encelor> dunno why Keepo 

[16:57] <thatanonyraccoon> you cant even really play new Hitman on console unless youre online 
[16:58] <theycallmejimbob> Sega delayed the PC release of Sonic Mania by 2 weeks so they could include 
denuvo always online drm dspPepe 

[16:58] <borisstingy> Would be cool to see Phil tackle Mega Man 7, Mega Man 8, and Mega Man 9 since the 
Legecay Collection 2 came out a few months back. 

[16:58] <pcgamehunter> You mean that thing that doesn’t work anymore dspHmm @encelor ? 

[16:58] <i_came_here_to_something> It's not a DRM issue for Blade Runner @pcgamehunter the game has 
none. It's prob an IP/rights issue and Westwood (the dev) is out of business. Prob coming down to licensing cost 
reasons it's not there sadly. 

[16:58] <kingofhypocrisy> I thought the new hitman games were all casual easy mode 

[16:58] <pcgamehunter> But yeah people are acting like Denuvo are templars coming to burn their house down 
and rape their family LUL 

[16:58] <encelor> @pcgamehunter no clue what you talking about stranger Keepo 

[16:58] <channel33> shes not the worst phil 

[16:58] <mastersaruwatari> great ending to an awesome stream. 

[16:58] <dweebenheimer20> @pcgamehunter fuck DRM 

[16:58] <mastersaruwatari> 101-27 

[16:58] <theycallmejimbob> true that PC dspHmm 

[16:58] <thatanonyraccoon> i’d rather they rape my family then make my games always online 

[16:59] <channel33> if phil wins with somebody theyre usually broken high tier like darkseid in injustice when 

phil said "hes not broken" 

[16:59] <eyesonwater> even garuda got better basics and good dmg 

[16:59] <pcgamehunter> @I_Came_Here_To_Something yeah that's the other reason. Didn’t some game get 

removed from GOG, because of that 

[16:59] <fhiffymoochicken> you did really good with her :) 

[16:59] <infinite_55> Man Phila€™s really good at this game! 

[16:59] <theycallmejimbob> least the overall user review score wasn’t badly affected dspHmm 
[16:59] <kingofhypocrisy> Her Artwork doesn’t look much like the character model 
[16:59] <encelor> i got denuvo on star ocean i played it offline 



[16:59] <pcgamehunter> I love the art design for these characters :D 
[16:59] <mastersaruwatari> 74 games over 500. 

[16:59] <encelor> no need for online 
[16:59] <kingofhypocrisy> face is different 
[16:59] <channel33> what game ISNT laggy phil? 

[16:59] <rukiaxplaynetwork> lol 

[16:59] <dweebenheimer20> They're adding Doctrine Dark and Blair 
[16:59] <thatanonyraccoon> @Channel33 Tetris 
[16:59] <kingofhypocrisy> @Channel33 Pong 
[16:59] <dukaduka> so is this a good fighting game? 

[16:59] <i_came_here_to_something> I think so @pcgamehunter , but don’t remember which one 
[16:59] <vashon91> DSP playing a fighting game? What year is this?
