[14:25] <grizzlyjee> Oh god I don't even want to think about phil setting up an emulator 
[14:25] <5star_hentai> any finds from steam autumn sale? 

[14:25] <kekon3> Project 64 became very optimized recently, if emulation is the question, that's the answer

[14:25] <vashyoyo> that version sucks

an ask 

[14:26] <encelor> BBC goomba 

[14:26] <bethemadeagle> diddy racing sucks 

[14:27] <theycallmejimbob> have you played it BetheMadEagle dspHmm

[14:27] <bobbi_ling> you know it anyway 

[14:27] <me_god> the only emulator with real issues I know of is the ps2 emu. doesn't get along with capture 

software 

[14:27] <kekon3> @majorkyon I will say, don't doubt the resources streaming takes, it's easily x4 what running 
an emulator is

[14:28] <kekon3> A cartridge of Mario 64 DS isn't too difficult to get, they should be relatively cheap. But I’d 

recommend just emulation of 64 @darksydephil 

[14:28] <encelor> lankey kong 

[14:28] <bobbi_ling> so you do too 

[14:29] <bethemadeagle> so bobbi

[14:51] <streetdojo> net neutrality = "Without those regulations, companies like Verizon could bundle together 
internet websites like cable plans, charging customers more for access to what they see as premium sites and 
content."Not looking forward to PAYING Brighthouse for enough bandwidth to watch Netflix. Then PAYING 
Netflix to watch Netflix. 

[14:51] <kekon3> There’s harsher restrictions on gambling, but also taxing :) 



[14:51] <sardarkh> Net Neutrality = US being US 
[14:51] <bethemadeagle> jim likes gmbling

[14:53] <5star_hentai> russia just yesterday declared vpn's illegal and banned torrent traffic and tor. you should 
fight for net neutrality or eventually you'll be there too 

[14:53] <bos2161> Net Neutrality lol Wasn’t even a thing until 2014 and there wasn’t a problem before then. I'm 

not worried about it. It's totalitarian anyway to force companies to service their competitors for free anyway.

[14:53] <vendatus> dspPepe 

[14:54] <bobbi_ling> is net netrality likely to win the vote? 

[14:54] <kekon3> Net neutrality is the idea that the Internet is something that should be public access, or uh. 
That companies can't hold websites hostage. The Internet should be an entirety, not its parts

[14:57] <godofdonuts007> What other good games are for this system other than this game ? Anyone know 



[14:57] <kekon3> Net neutrality is in trouble constantly because of company interested politicians who got 

pockets. Stealth sessions and pushes occur on the regular so everyone coming out and shouting it is because of 

the latest attempt to pass things in the background 

[14:57] <encelor> america really wanna screw over internet 

[14:57] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Wompa fruit? 

[14:57] <theycallmejimbob> did anyone in the chat buy anything from the steam sale so far dspHmm

[16:35] <kingjezal> Yeah, this is blatantly Pepe Mario, sorry. 

[16:37] <karlis_k> cheerlOO the amount of content in this game is simply insane! EA could learn a thing or two... 
[16:38] <thatanonybear> dspPepe I wanna be in a Mario game 
[16:38] <wholetruthbruce> Fuck ea and ea sports 
[16:38] <oooooar> "suck a dick ea sports" 

[16:38] <thatanonybear> EA: Lootbox Everything 
[16:39] <fluttershyl970> bow i want a pepe mario plushie 

[16:39] <thatanonybear> When EA was first founded, its founder asked himself "can video games make a person 
cry?" With lootboxes, now every game can make you cry. 

[16:39] <fluttershyl970> now 
[16:40] <thatanonybear> wow 
[16:41] <vashyoyo> pepsi plunge 

[16:41] <karlis_k> cheerlOO what's the death counter at? 

[16:41] <oooooar> someone made a vid and literally nothing happened 



[16:41] <oooooar> u dont even go negative coins 

[16:41] <thatanonybear> twitch needs a death counter extension 

[16:42] <fluttershyl970> death conter die 

[16:42] <taniaraven> Image if Nintendo added a lootbox style progression system? i’d have a heart attack. Phil is 
Super Mario a Switch seller must buy? 

[16:42] <oooooar> lmao 

[16:43] <johngaltwho> switch is a seller based on the gimmick 

[16:43] <beatlesl2335> lol I got phil having fun with this instead of going to the moon, sorry lads AA ; 

[16:43] <taniaraven> THE game that gets people to buy a Switch 
[16:43] <strugglesome> no gimmick 

[16:43] <johngaltwho> you don’t thi nk "portable console" is a gimmick? 

[16:43] <thatanonybear> @TaniaRaven imo this is a system seller, especially with the library the console already 
built up 

[16:43] <johngaltwho> it's not like it's a bad thing 
[16:44] <taniaraven> Switch or Xbox One X? 

[16:44] <johngaltwho> do you have an xbox one? 

[16:44] <thatanonybear> idk if it's a gimmick because it's directly building off Wii U tech, it seems to be 

Nintendo's general direction toward portables 

[16:44] <taniaraven> yea but its inferior to the X 

[16:44] <johngaltwho> wiiu was totally a gimmick 

[16:44] <masternutella> What heck 

[16:45] <johngaltwho> do you have a 4k tv? 

[16:45] <masternutella> How did he get the 64 model 
[16:45] <taniaraven> no john 

[16:45] <johngaltwho> don't bother buying the X if you don't have a 4k tv 

[16:45] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho i mean, when all your consoles adopt the same "gimmick" it stops 

being much of a gimmick :P 

[16:46] <johngaltwho> the tablet was a total gimin 

[16:46] <taniaraven> ok i'll buy a Switch with Super Mario and Zelda friday 
[16:46] <johngaltwho> rememer star fox? I do. it made me sad 
[16:46] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho Star Fox was an atrocity :( 

[16:46] <oooooar> FFAAAAATHERRRR?? 

[16:47] <taniaraven> Phil can you give us your first impressions of Super Mario? 

[16:47] <johngaltwho> it was a cool gimmick don't get me wrong. I like the tablet, my kid watches youtube on it 
constantly 

[16:48] <thatanonybear> the Wii U tablet? 

[16:48] <johngaltwho> yup 

[16:48] <thatanonybear> I never got the Wii U, seems like crap 

[16:49] <vashyoyo> look at one of those flying balloon ships in the air using the green scope thingy 
[16:49] <thatanonybear> makes sense now, as a stepping stone from Wii to Switch 

[16:49] <taniaraven> i watch youtube on xbox more the anything because the app woth force you to suspend a 
game like PS4 does 

[16:49] <johngaltwho> yeah I use hulu, youtube, wwe network, etc 
[16:49] <thatanonybear> plus PS4's youtube app is trash 

[16:49] <johngaltwho> but I just bought all the holiday games on the xbox store sale 
[16:49] <johngaltwho> most of PS4's UI is trash. 

[16:50] <taniaraven> its not as loud as the xbox app 

[16:50] <johngaltwho> my ps4 takes five minutes to load the store sometimes 
[16:50] <thatanonybear> 5 mins? holy shit 
[16:50] <johngaltwho> sometimes 3 sometimes 5. 

[16:50] <johngaltwho> it's annoying 

[16:51] <johngaltwho> plus my closest gaming friends are on xbox. we just chill in party 



[16:51] <thatanonybear> i just opened PS store and it took like 20 secs NotLikeThis 
[16:51] <johngaltwho> maybe it's just me 

[16:52] <thatanonybear> I'm sure if you got a new console it'd be better LUL 
[16:52] <thatanonybear> buy a PS4 PRO :P 

[16:52] <zah_rastafari> just want to the damn checkpoint you hit before rofl 
[16:52] <johngaltwho> yeah it's a launch ps4 

[16:52] <taniaraven> does Phil respond to viewers if he sees a bits donation? 

[16:52] <thatanonybear> @TaniaRaven yea 
[16:52] <vashyoyo> yes 

[16:52] <johngaltwho> yeah he responds to any comment he sees as worthy 
[16:52] <thatanonybear> almost always 
[16:52] <johngaltwho> including bits 

[16:52] <thatanonybear> he might not read the comment you put with it tho lol 

[16:53] <taniaraven> i understood how its easier to see from chat spam 

[16:53] <concretecasket> cheer50 

[16:53] <johngaltwho> most times chat is pretty slow 

[16:53] <johngaltwho> unless it's a new game 

[16:53] <thatanonybear> or MVC:I 

[16:54] <johngaltwho> yeah fighting games seem to be the magic button 
[16:54] <thatanonybear> chat was crazy busy for that for weeks 
[16:54] <taniaraven> cheer 10 test 

[16:54] <thatanonybear> @TaniaRaven there's no space between "cheer" and the number 

[16:54] <taniaraven> using xbox twitch app 

[16:54] <taniaraven> cheer 10 test 

[16:55] <thatanonybear> maybe you dont have bits 

[16:55] <taniaraven> yea i spent them along time ago 

[16:56] <goldencolts> cheer 100 

[16:56] <taniaraven> i just dont know if you need to on a browser or if the xbox twitch app allows it 
[16:56] <beatlesl2335> vheck the store 
[16:56] <beatlesl2335> *check 

[16:57] <taniaraven> i remember using ps4 browser last time 

[16:58] <jaybirdl983> if u look through the flying telescope u should see sphix flying by u should get a moon 
[16:58] <slowbrosif> cheer 10 how did you like oblivion? 

[16:58] <thatanonybear> that horrible feeling when you're missing ONE QUILL in Yooka Laylee, one away

[17:02] <thatanonybear> tbf i haven't read it either yet

[17:02] <johngaltwho> the concept is pretty daffy 

[17:02] <taniaraven> is the game only on switch? not wii like zelda 

[17:02] <thatanonybear> daffy? like daffy duck? 

[17:03] <masternutella> wii sucks ass 

[17:03] <johngaltwho> you're despicable 

[17:03] <thatanonybear> sufferin sucotash, this book is awful! 

[17:03] <kingjezal> Do you have to accept a gift sub for it to do through? 

[17:03] <kingjezal> *go 
[17:03] <thatanonybear> @KingJezal Nope 
[17:03] <thatanonybear> they are forced to accept 
[17:03] <chocolaterampage30> @TaniaRaven switch only 
[17:03] <thatanonybear> WHAT THE HUHHHH? 

[17:03] <kurojp> you can force a kaceytron sub down someone's throat 
[17:04] <tr9000> whahappuh? I tripped on a dwarf 
[17:04] <johngaltwho> slick moves 

[17:04] <kingjezal> @ThatAnonyBear I mean, does it just go through automatically, or do you press "accept" or 
something? 

[17:04] <zah_rastafari> your going to need to turn the camera arounbd to see the hidden star onthis stage 
[17:04] <thatanonybear> @KingJezal the person sendding it has to jump through hoops, but it's autmatic for the 
one receiving it 

[17:04] <kingjezal> Okay, thanks. 

[17:04] <thatanonybear> these stages remind me of the SMS secret stages 

[17:05] <thatanonybear> there’s some INSANE platforming in some of those SMS secret stages 

[17:05] <thatanonybear> i don't think DSP will ever beat the sand bird boss in SMS

[17:11] <thatanonybear> @aragorio terrible :( 

[17:11] <thatanonybear> we’re kinda burned out on em 

[17:11] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil you need to finish games quicker, other people have watched other 
streamers finish them 

[17:12] <aragorio> I can send him some pictures of penises. Does that count? 

[17:12] <hobbsl017> just start pounding out games quicker 
[17:12] <kozatof> Youa€™re too slow at finishing games 
[17:12] <kozatof> Way too s,ow 

[17:12] <aragorio> I would love to see dsp pound games 
[17:12] <kozatof> Slow 

[17:12] <kozatof> You used to finish games on the same day you got them 

[17:13] <thatanonybear> are we finally learning about the looming financial woes tomorrow? :o 

[17:13] <kozatof> What happened 

[17:13] <aragorio> That has literally never happened on dspgaming 
[17:13] <duane_barry> I want to see you play desert bus 
[17:13] <kozatof> Yeh there were some games he finished in the same day 
[17:13] <duane_barry> will you play and finish desert bus 

[17:13] <thatanonybear> @Duane_Barry want into one hand, drive a bus into the other 

[17:13] <kozatof> When he actually stayed up and played till the ama€™s 

[17:13] <taniaraven> i’d rather have DSP play games as his own pace. Not rush through games 

[17:13] <aragorio> Maybe tiny episodic releases but never triple A games 

[17:13] <hobbsl017> like ive already watched 2 ppl beat mario and ass. creed 

[17:13] <crashed_ink> Bye Phil 

[17:14] <kozatof> @aragorio believe me before direct capture. He used to be faster at finishing gems 
[17:14] <kozatof> Games 

[17:14] <thatanonybear> I'm HYPED for the HATE tomorrow 

[17:14] <kozatof> Why do you think he takes his time with games now 

[17:15] <kozatof> Because he used to rush through games 

[17:18] <extracheeez> it will all be worth it to see phil rage at dark/darker side 

[17:18] <extracheeez> it will be epic 

[17:19] <thatanonybear> is it THAT hard? 

[17:19] <thatanonybear> like, SMS gets crazy, but this game seems p easy 
[17:19] <extracheeez> darker took trihex 2 hours :/ 

[17:19] <kozatof> Like if we take old phil and bring him here, Mario could already be done 
[17:19] <extracheeez> took me all day plus one broken controller 
[17:20] <kozatof> Just get the mandatory moons and go to next world 
[17:20] <immortalphoenix> is the stream live btw?
