[12:41] <aproxymate> Ntomar Kasia Hai? 

[12:41] <itakedrukqs> destiny 2 is a braindead game in general bruh 
[12:41] <vendatus> You can get to 305 without doing it LUL

[12:42] <micgelo09> @itakedrukqs and how exactly is it braindead 
[12:42] <wubegg> This one's the best SourPls 
[12:42] <aproxymate> Where do you work @ntomar ? 

[12:43] <itakedrukqs> you can walk through 95% of the content with precisely zero difficulty, it bores me 



[12:43] <ntomar> ITBP , posted at Indo China border 

[12:44] <vendatus> Faction Rally isn’t worth it I’ll prob log on when IB returns or Season 2 starts LUL 
[12:44] <aproxymate> Good use of night shift. Have done the same for a couple of months a decade ago 
[12:44] <vendatus> oh it's Doom LUL 
[12:45] <kekon3> VoHiYo boys and girls 
[12:45] <kekon3> How's it going party people 

[12:45] <micgelo09> so your saying you want enemies to be more difficult? @itakedrukqs 
[12:45] <darksydephil> looks like muxy may be delayed again today 
[12:46] <ntomar> Aproxymate my full name is Nishant Indra Tomar 

[12:46] <itakedrukqs> @micgelo09 it’d be nice for the game overall to be more challenging/interesting, just my 
opinion, doesn't seem like I'm alone in that regard though 

[12:46] <kekon3> At my local wing place rn, when I get home I'm subbing today lol 

[12:46] <vendatus> Gotta wait till that Osiris drop LUL

[12:48] <vendatus> VoHiYo 

[12:49] <vendatus> Jimbob use the new emote LUL 

[12:49] <micgelo09> @itakedrukqs i can agree with you about difficulty but most people that dont like destiny 
say their isnt any story in which i disagree because the game talks more about the enemy factions and provide 
more personality in the story to the characters you met in the tower instead of just talking to them in a hud

[13:41] <optionalsuperboss> meh. chances are they're just laying off expensive older programmers to hire a 
buncha cheap fresh out of college ones. 

[13:42] <deadchildsun> feathers? 

[13:42] <myfellowjohnson> they need to lay off the cartoonish graphics and do something more close to Until 
Dawn. And with choices that MATTER. 

[13:42] <markymark52> you have to use your hat to get the butterfly Phil 

[13:42] <kinggoken> yes they do need a new graphics engine 

[13:42] <chairmancaleb> I've grown out of Telltale after The Walking Dead.

[14:00] <neverjob> thats it 

[14:00] <huffysan> @kozatof Yeah, probably that's why. 

[14:00] <kinggoken> lrnao hpsters? 

[14:00] <theycallmejimbob> this looks amazing dspShock 
[14:00] <kinggoken> hipsters 

[14:00] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> If shea€™s from DK, did she get amnesia or something FUF

[14:01] <davikombat> im a hipster, hate mario 

[14:01] <youngkam513> Mario is a cuck bowser stays taking his girl 

[14:01] <coldkiller86> @darksydephil warp painting behind odyssey 

[14:01] <vashyoyo> Mayor pauline is the chick Mario saves in donkey kong arcade, and yeah probably some 
dong amnesia 

[14:01] <neverjob> well then there u go @davikombat. ur a hipster, ur opinion is supposed to generally be 

considered trashed 

[14:01] <neverjob> thats the point 

[14:01] <korewasugoi> Rosaline is best grill anyway 

[14:01] <davikombat> i like bubsy 

[14:01] <vashyoyo> daisy my pal is waifu 



[14:01] <kinggoken> this stage kind of reminds me of something you would see a game like Sonic Adventure 

[14:01] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Super GTA mario 

[14:01] <imbadatdota2> dsp's bitrate is fucked 

[14:01] <vashyoyo> daisy > Rosalina > pauline »»»peach

[14:02] <korewasugoi> @lButtonDash 100% is hard 

[14:02] <huffysan> By the way, why it's called "Super" Mario Odyssey? All "Super" Mario games were for 
SNES. Why this one called like this? 

[14:02] <youngkam513> Sonic forces is garbage sega and the Internet sonic fanbase destroyed the franchise 
[14:03] <jayjay2477> Does anybody know how many moons he got? 

[14:03] <kinggoken> lmao 

[14:03] <neverjob> got me there @huffysan 

[14:03] <kinggoken> yeah sonic forces is trash

[14:03] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> SMB 3 ? 

[14:03] <kinggoken> Sonic has fallen off 
[14:03] <davikombat> Because Its a super thrash 
[14:03] <korewasugoi> Sonic Trashes 

[14:03] <kinggoken> Nintendo needs to take over that franchise 
[14:03] <neverjob> oh ya. the gba one 

[14:03] <korewasugoi> @Kinggoken they also need to get Megaman 

[14:03] <jetset3000> i hope Nintendo will make a new Donkey Kong platformer for Switch.. Tropical Freeze is 
awesome 

[14:03] <kinggoken> i agree 

[14:03] <davikombat> Sonic 06 is better than any Mario 
[14:03] <vashyoyo> ride the scooter 
[14:03] <bobbi_ling> nintendo needs to sell donkey kong 
[14:03] <youngkam513> Sonic heroes was the best direction 
[14:03] <neverjob> also, mario 64 is super isnt it? 

[14:04] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Tanooki Sonic suit 
[14:04] <kinggoken> I loved Tropical Freeze. Such a good game 
[14:04] <kinggoken> not sure how well it sold

[14:07] <ctrl_alt_dell> when autistic people play mario 

[14:07] <kinggoken> i don’t think i went to this part 

[14:07] <steamboshow> Can you do reverse jumps for more height in this game like you can do in Sunshine? 
[14:07] <coldkiller86> you have to do the boss first phil 

[14:07] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> This music sounds like Luigia€™s mansion 

[14:07] <vashyoyo> boss first 

[14:07] <dantheman7986> come back to it later 

[14:07] <kinggoken> dsp come back to this part 

[14:07] <korewasugoi> FIGHT THE BOSS AND THEN EXPLORE PHIL 

[14:07] <nightbot> KoreWaSugoi -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning]

[14:07] <turbopebble> The boss is the one from the E3 trailer 

[14:08] <elzorrobot> is mario wearing a bomber jacket or a santa suit 

[14:08] <superlabargebros> Therea€™s really not much you can do until after the boss. Everything is kind of 
blocked off. 

[14:08] <turbopebble> Uncle Sherm you must be! 

[14:08] <doctorzzz> just like in old marios, when you defeat bosses more unlocks 

[14:08] <neverjob> ok. its hard to tell, lotta ppl like to trash nintendos graphics when nobody else does their style 
@jetset3000 .

[15:34] <toooldforgaming> I always hear whatever it is in your background 
[15:34] <toooldforgaming> Why is it in 30FPS? 

[15:35] <toooldforgaming> Or is this game 30FPS? 

[15:35] <eternia_forever> oh he’s in the real world now PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp 
[15:35] <blue_blur64> game’s 60fps 

[15:35] <thebigjeffproducktions> phil took a "bathroom break" to go run down to wahnart and buy the Mario 
Odyssey prima guide 

[15:35] <gutty333> can you stomp on those blue tents? 

[15:35] <toooldforgaming> I swear I’ve seen this more fluid 

[15:35] <blue_blur64> And he's streaming at 60fps 

[15:35] <blue_blur64> So it has to be your internet 

[15:35] <toooldforgaming> He's streaming at 60FPS, but it's not in 60FPS 

[15:35] <blue_blur64> But it is in 60fps 

[15:36] <toooldforgaming> Actually it's not, considering I deal with AV gear this feels like 30FPS 
[15:36] <chairmancaleb> @toooldforgaming, But it is..? Maybe your eyes are playing tricks with you. 

[15:36] <thebigjeffproducktions> I think he's broadcasting in 60FPS but only capturing 30FPS. 

[15:36] <toooldforgaming> Yeah 
[15:36] <kozatof> Yeah a€~ 

[15:36] <blue_blur64> No, he's capturing in 60fps as well 

[15:36] <toooldforgaming> He's broadcasting 60FPS, game is 30FPS 

[15:37] <toooldforgaming> I'm checking another stream right now and it's 60FPS 

[15:37] <blue_blur64> Game is 60fps 

[15:37] <jamiepaulbaldwin> who cares what fps hes steaming at >_> 

[15:38] <toooldforgaming> Well sorry I was just wondering because the stream said 720p60FPS 
[15:38] <kozatof> @darksydephil what is your FPS 

[15:38] <toooldforgaming> I’ve looked at 2 streams and their 60FPS is 60FPS 

[15:38] <darthradovanviking> I think it looks fluent and good quality. Without a side by side comparison I don't 
thi nk I would be able to spot the difference 
[15:38] <darthradovanviking> if there is any. 

[15:38] <toooldforgaming> Your stream is reporting 60FPS, but it's not 60FPS 
[15:38] <mo nk eebrains> Can you get it that machine? 

[15:38] <thebigjeffproducktions> oh 
[15:38] <eternia_forever> on source 
[15:38] <thebigjeffproducktions> Lmfao

[15:39] <arrowhead371> i don’t notice any difference, but maybe it's just me 
[15:39] <toooldforgaming> What capture card is he using? 

[15:39] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> fucking pigeons dropping frames 

[15:40] <kozatof> Ahhhh I see

[15:40] <kozatof> Ahhhh 

[15:40] <pixelatedpolygons> yeah playing it now, deffo smoother for me, don’t really matter though 
[15:40] <thedoctor5437> how do u people even notice the F ing difference, it all looks the same to me 
[15:40] <toooldforgaming> Considering I work with AV gear, you need to take my word with it dude, it's not 
smooth 

[15:40] <chairmancaleb> TooOld is trolling, don’t give him the attention he's seeking. 

[15:40] <toooldforgaming> Well it's smooth 30FPS 

[15:40] <dragonsky878> yep, look youre gonna blame the game for lag, its a handheld, of course it would lag 
[15:40] <sardarkh> Scorpio still has 30 FPS 

[15:40] <toooldforgaming> I am not trolling! I'll capture the video right now 
[15:40] <gutty333> so is the capture from Phil? 

[15:40] <vashyoyo> rambi :o 
[15:40] <kozatof> Is this docked 
[15:41] <blue_blur64> well of course it's docked 
[15:41] <kozatof> Feelsgoodman 

[15:41] <chairmancaleb> @kozatof, Can't stream the game if it's not docked, lol 
[15:41] <vashyoyo> look at ground level 

[15:41] <dinq_sas_sirence> its 100% 60fps all the time... watch Digital Foundry's analysis 
[15:41] <sardarkh> City seems as rough as FFXIII cities 
[15:41] <dragonsky878> IN THE BATHROOM XDD 

[15:42] <vashyoyo> well its in 60fps sardarkH name a open world console game thats 60fps :s 

[15:42] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> just enjoy the stream, doesn’t matter if it isn't 60fps or 1440p 

[15:42] <toooldforgaming> I just captured his stream with 60FPS 

[15:42] <toooldforgaming> And his stream is doubling frames 

[15:42] <sardarkh> @Vashyoyo Planet Earth is a fine >60FPS open world game 

[15:42] <vashyoyo> lol

[15:43] <toooldforgaming> He's got a config problem soemwhere 
[15:43] <blue_blur64> Porn of course Kappa 

[15:43] <frankenfunk> TooOldForGaming who cares? speedNotLinkThis 

[15:43] <vashyoyo> lol 

[15:43] <genesisdestiny> its 24/7 60fps 

[15:43] <pixelatedpolygons> the switch doesn't dip, its obs i think 

[15:43] <blue_blur64> Although I guess porn in public would be bad, good thing that laptop is in a corner Kappa 



[15:43] <eternia_forever> lol @genesisdestiny 

[15:43] <toooldforgaming> I was just wondering franken since I selected 720p 60FPS source 
[15:43] <kozatof> @blue_blur64 nah man own it, watch that porn in public 

[15:43] <dragonsky878> @blue_blur64 wow, do you really have to bring that up, most of the time i think people 

who think like that are just 12 year olds 

[15:44] <vashyoyo> yeah theres dips in New donk city 

[15:44] <kinggoken> A 

[15:44] <dragonsky878> @vashyoyo or should you say New Dunk City 

[15:44] <fabsgnecco> but what if your television doesnt show 60fps ? Kappa 

[15:44] <toooldforgaming> My live capture of his stream shows frame doubling 

[15:44] <fabsgnecco> life runs at 60fps 

[15:44] <vashyoyo> New Dip city dragonsky878 

[15:44] <i_came_here_to_something> why was the chat cleared?

[15:45] <vashyoyo> ah 

[15:45] <mjll986> All board the failboat 

[15:45] <thebigjeffproducktions> The chat was cleared because we got too close to the truth.

[15:45] <naokib4u> Make sure to talk to the instrument street performers 
[15:45] <darthradovanviking> Kappa 

[15:45] <poopsinbed> New donk has some load hitching as it streams in assests. Especially during the opening 

when you spark in 

[15:45] <emnay_i_say> 4Head 

[15:45] <toooldforgaming> I'l 1 just set the stream to 720p 30FPS then 
[15:45] <ratchefanl2> too much chatting about frame rate 
[15:45] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> chat dipped frames and got refreshed 
[15:45] <vashyoyo> go to other areas on ground ? 

[15:45] <dragonsky878> im a bot Kappa 

[15:45] <toooldforgaming> Oh I can’t do that

[15:45] <dragonsky878> @kozatof lei, no 

[15:46] <chairmancaleb> Yes Phil, quit listening to the trolls. 

[15:46] <toooldforgaming> You're broadcasting, but it's not set to 60FPS 
[15:46] <metalslimex> Yes I'm seeing 60fps 
[15:46] <darthradovanviking> OK! 

[15:46] <pl4guet4stic> I get 60 fps with quite constant dips but that's due to the game I reckon 
[15:46] <kozatof> Scooter was right 

[15:46] <kushiyakitori> yeah, people said take the scooter the HIGH way 
[15:46] <vashyoyo> try entering other buildigs dsp 

[15:46] <toooldforgaming> Chairman: You want me to prove it's 30FPS? I can upload the video 
[15:46] <danjack007> happy people dont count frames 

[15:46] <dragonsky878> yes, cuz we clearly see the game in 60fps we’re considered trolls 

[15:46] <toooldforgaming> I got zero issues 

[15:47] <bernielomax517> This game looks awesome 

[15:47] <darthradovanviking> Ok I will be right back. 

[15:47] <frankenfunk> how can you tell if its 60 fps if our eyes can only seen 15 fps MiniK

[15:49] <toooldforgaming> I’m actually gotten incredibly good with audio desync offsets and being dead on just 

by sight instead of sticking it into an editor and counting frames 

[15:49] <vashyoyo> climb to the top 

[15:49] <jamiepaulbaldwin> this game needs more boobs 

[15:49] <frankenfunk> yo.. The bancon ranch chicken cheesesteak from Jersey mikes is the greatest sub of all

[15:51] <xxghostbritxx> i thought phil was eating healthier

[15:51] <vashyoyo> hm wrong one then 

[15:51] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> he has a 780ti 

[15:52] <toooldforgaming> 780ti is vastly out of date 

[15:52] <djrunol> maybe there is a flick thing at a high point somewhere 

[15:52] <bernielomax517> @dragonsky878 behave yourself Kappa 

[15:52] <vashyoyo> maybe from here, with cappy dive jump you can make it? 

[15:52] <meelad360> dive > hat throw > dive cancel 
[15:52] <kozatof> Vash come on man 
[15:52] <vashyoyo> the side maybe? 

[15:52] <toooldforgaming> You wouldn’t use it to game 



[15:52] <toooldforgaming> You'd use it for streaming 

[15:52] <frankenfunk> if you jump, do a hat jump and then dive you might be able to make it 
[15:52] <kekon3> Phils comp was built over 5 years ago I thi nk 
[15:52] <naokib4u> secret door, you can’t jump to that 

[15:52] <dragonsky878> Phil, get ready for demonization from Nintendo cuz theyre assholes 
[15:52] <kozatof> @toooldforgaming therea€™s a reason why hea€™s not a pc guy 
[15:52] <toooldforgaming> Kekon: Yeah but not for GPU streaming 
[15:52] <vashyoyo> dive jump yes 

[15:52] <toooldforgaming> I’ve streamed 1080p 60FPS with a Skylake

[15:54] <aidOkennl> WTF DSP not saying the game is shit when he loses PogChamp 

[15:54] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @aidOkennl no akumas 

[15:54] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil Clipped that jump too for ya 

[15:55] <aidOkennl> hahaha I understand though, Nintendo did a good job 

[15:55] <dragonsky878> lei 

[15:55] <dragonsky878> B) 



[15:55] <dragonsky878> not really secret 

[15:55] <i_came_here_to_something> Well, they've certainly done a better job than Sonic Team did w/ Forces 
Kappa 

[15:55] <dragonsky878> @i_came_here_to_something yeah lei 

[15:55] <toooldforgaming> The only thing I've heard people are upset about this game is that it's too easy, but 

everyone always wants another Mario Sunshine 

[15:56] <im_not_a_hipster> ay ay ay 

[15:56] <mjll986> This is sum Ninja Warrior shit 

[15:56] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> we only cared for sonic mania 

[15:56] <aidOkennl> its 2017 gaming is easier for mainstream 

[15:56] <toooldforgaming> That's OBS reporting 30FPS 

[15:56] <dragonsky878> go in pipe 

[15:56] <dragonsky878> lei 

[15:56] <i_came_here_to_something> Sega really should've put their marketing being Mania, not Forces. 

[15:56] <vashyoyo> thats a lot of people 

[15:57] <vashyoyo> jump up 

[15:57] <blue_blur64> Gotta go with traffic xD 

[15:57] <blue_blur64> They did for both 

[15:57] <pl4guet4stic> @I_Came_Here_To_Something implying Forces was a total failure. Oh right... 

[15:57] <eternia_forever> they are stuck in the matrix 

[15:57] <toooldforgaming> It's not 60FPS, I already proved it by looking at the capture directly 
[15:57] <aidOkennl> if the switch wasnt so expensive I would buy this my self 
[15:57] <toooldforgaming> Switch is actually cheap 

[15:58] <dragonsky878> have you seen the real Mario Odyssey, its a funny video XD 
[15:58] <aidOkennl> wtf here its 330 euro 
[15:58] <blue_blur64> $300 in the US 
[15:58] <vashyoyo> go in the other door 

[15:58] <toooldforgaming> Ok put it this way, the switch is cheap for the hardware that is in it 
[15:58] <emnay_i_say> Garbage ware LuL 
[15:58] <aidOkennl> i buy ps4 here for 150 euro 

[15:58] <ronmexicooo> @aid0kennl $300 is expensive but in relation to the fireken xbox x being $500 its cheap 
[15:58] <turbopebble> Out of the way, anuses. 

[15:58] <toooldforgaming> The switch has a Tegra XI in it 

[15:58] <dragonsky878> its crowded asf 

[15:58] <frankenfunk> Xbone LUL 

[15:59] <aid0kennl> yeah 300 dollar is like 295 euro 

[15:59] <toooldforgaming> It's basically an Nvidia Tegra XI tablet 

[15:59] <i_came_here_to_something> @PL4GUET4STIC Not saying it is. But, Mania was a lot more inspired 
and just better built. Forces is just another average 3D Sonic game and that's no different since 2012 tbh. But at 
least it's better than Sonic Boom. 

[15:59] <aid0kennl> here its freaking 330, and If I am going to buy it I will need games etc. Will be expensive 
trust mehahha 

[15:59] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Xbox One X is similar to a 1060 though 

[15:59] <toooldforgaming> The only current Tegra XI tablet other than the Switch is the one google sells 
[15:59] <dragonsky878> @i_came_here_to_something Mania has those frames tho 
[15:59] <aid0kennl> I will buy it for sure, but got to save up. 

[15:59] <vashyoyo> rambi is the rhyno from DK 
[15:59] <toooldforgaming> And that's $700 american 

[15:59] <blue_blur64> Thank you for at least saying that last statement, because I've seen people seriously say 
that 06 is better than Forces DansGame 

[15:59] <shoshone> wow, this is the most handsome streamer I've ever laid eyes on 
[15:59] <vashyoyo> lol 



[15:59] <eternia_forever> i have not seen a black friday preview ad as of yet that has the ps4 pro on sale :( 
[15:59] <doctorzzz> WutFace 
[15:59] <blue_blur64> 0_o 

[16:00] <i_came_here_to_something> @dragonsky878 beautiful frames, even. 

[16:00] <speedweed_> wtf 

[16:00] <dragonsky878> that dinosaur sounds like a screaming raging kid XD 

[16:00] <pl4guet4stic> @I_Came_Here_To_Something to be fair, it being better than Sonic Boom is not really 
saying much. And yeah it isn’t the worst Sonic game ever but feels extremely rushed. 

[16:00] <blue_blur64> Well now I know where I'm missing a bunch of coins 

[16:00] <doctorzzz> PETA 

[16:00] <eternia_forever> this is to cool 

[16:00] <frankenfunk> well sonic mania was made by people who were passionate about the oldschool sonic 
games. Thats why sonic mania was so good 
[16:00] <xxghostbritxx> unearned moon 

[16:00] <toooldforgaming> The switch as in itself is cheap though 
[16:00] <toooldforgaming> Nintendo is undercutting it 
[16:01] <mjll986> Did he say Rambi or Hurambe? 

[16:01] <aid0kennl> true but with complete package games / pro controller 
[16:01] <aid0kennl> it will be expensive anyway 

[16:01] <blue_blur64> I'm still playing Forces right now btw, so it's good to me :P 
[16:01] <aid0kennl> you dont need a subscription for online play right?? 

[16:01] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Yakuza has a better reputation than Sonic nowadays 
[16:01] <i_came_here_to_something> @PL4GUET4STIC And that's the hilarious part; they've had four years 
since Lost World to make this and they end up w/ Forces. They probably kept taking stuff out back and on, or 
had staff shakeups. 

[16:01] <dragonsky878> guys the dinosaur does sound like a raging Xbox kid XDDDD 
[16:01] <blue_blur64> I just can’t find this damn second ring in the 4th stage brownFEELS 
[16:01] <pl4guet4stic> DSP the Moon Man 

[16:01] <frankenfunk> some people like bad games.. I myself like some pretty terrible games 
[16:01] <djrunol> this is some fucking scooter 

[16:01] <jack_spartacus> @DarksydePhil oh no its going to be inspector gadget from the movie! 

[16:01] <toooldforgaming> You need to pay for online past december 2017 
[16:02] <toooldforgaming> After that you have to pay Nintendo for online 
[16:02] <blue_blur64> They never said January 
[16:02] <blue_blur64> Only 2018 

[16:02] <dragonsky878> construction outfit, aka mario maker outfit 

[16:02] <i_came_here_to_something> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz Sure does, and it's well deserved. Sega has 
many other IP more deserving of money these days than Sonic tbh. Feels like even Sonic Team wants to move 
on to something non-Sonic now. 

[16:02] <vashyoyo> make sure to sit by a guy on a bench Kappa 
[16:02] <mjll986> Dude, it's Pauline...Pauline from Donkey Kong man. 

[16:02] <pl4guet4stic> talk about staff shakeups @DarksydePhil what do you think about Telltale Games laying 
off lot of their workforce to form a smaller company and make fewer games in the future 
[16:03] <defylng_gr4vity> New Donk City lol 

[16:03] <toooldforgaming> Dude really? Don’t call me a liar. They're changing it to a Pay service December 

2017. That's why they are shutting down Miiverse 

[16:03] <micgelo09> the mayor looks like a taller daisy 

[16:03] <toooldforgaming> Miiverse is incompatible with the new system 

[16:03] <blue_blur64> Last I heard it was 2018 

[16:03] <dragonsky878> look at mario dance XD 

[16:03] <eternia_forever> Hope the Metroid for this will be perfect 

[16:03] <kozatof> Mayor is best girl

[16:03] <jack_spartacus> dspShock 

[16:03] <dragonsky878> @davikombat hi 

[16:03] <blue_blur64> And I know that Miiverse is already shut down 
[16:04] <aidOkennl> is miiverse over?? 

[16:04] <blue_blur64> Yes, it shut down last night 
[16:04] <aid0kennl> lol 

[16:04] <toooldforgaming> Phil if you stand there with the band mario will dance 
[16:04] <frankenfunk> TooOldForGaming You're a liar 
[16:04] <toooldforgaming> Yeah it shut down last night 
[16:04] <blue_blur64> Never used it myself 

[16:04] <toooldforgaming> The shutting down of Miiverse is to move to the new system 

[16:04] <djrunol> i never understood why mario chose to be with peach if he could've had rosalina 

[16:04] <davikombat> i was eating a Chinese 

[16:04] <dragonsky878> this might actually be a good lets play 

[16:04] <aid0kennl> nintendo going other ways I like PogChamp 

[16:04] <toooldforgaming> I mean they could have worked to keep Miiverse with the new pay system 
[16:04] <toooldforgaming> But I guess it cost too much 
[16:05] <vashyoyo> find a guy on a bench 
[16:05] <dragonsky878> TPFufun 

[16:05] <toooldforgaming> From what I was told it's because the old games are incompatible with the new 
system 

[16:05] <aid0kennl> I wonder what games will come in the future though 
[16:05] <neospartanhesperos9> find a guy on a bench and spot him TriHard

[16:19] <doctorzzz> they have a lighit over them so you can see where they are 
[16:19] <vashyoyo> you already been there i think 

[16:19] <thatanonybear> @ratchefanl2 they show their true colors eventually 
[16:19] <toooldforgaming> I'm 40 and I used to seriously lift between 12-20 
[16:19] <teslawasrobbedacl> wheres Trump tower? 

[16:19] <vashyoyo> 1 more musician left woop 

[16:19] <toooldforgaming> Phil must have lost literally all that muscle then 
[16:19] <ratchefanl2> i know i timed him out eariler 
[16:19] <doctorzzz> BASS 

[16:19] <matitoooo> @darksydephil the final one is where you ground pound the part of the media wiggler 
[16:19] <kozatof> Hey dsp phil Hey phil darksydephil find a guy on a bench and spot him TriHard darksydephil 
[16:19] <doctorzzz> look for the lightbeam outside 
[16:20] <i_came_here_to_something> where's the bass player? 

[16:20] <eternia_forever> du du du 

[16:20] <bpharu> the final musician was Mario all along 

[16:20] <darthradovanviking> very cool... 

[16:20] <vashyoyo> you already been there 
[16:20] <vashyoyo> its the boss dungeon 

[16:20] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Phil would destroy James Ellsworth 
[16:20] <toooldforgaming> Easiest way to see if a lifter lifted is to ask to see their legs 
[16:20] <dragonsky878> @bpharu but all Mario does is dance 
[16:20] <eternia_forever> ahhh haaa 

[16:20] <kozatof> Phil Hey dsp phil Hey phil darksydephil find a guy on a bench and spot him TriHard 
darksydephil 

[16:20] <toooldforgaming> A lifter will have calves even if they get old and out of shape 
[16:21] <djrunol> phil does have some strong calves tho 
[16:21] <vashyoyo> no point lol 
[16:21] <gentleman_werewolf> Ikr 

[16:21] <thatanonybear> @Too01dForGaming shouldn’t they be steers by that points? 

[16:21] <toooldforgaming> Since calves are the leanest part of the body and take the longest to decay 
[16:21] <darkone667> how would you know how his calves look? 

[16:21] <doctorzzz> you can climbt the antenna uptop 

[16:21] <ratchefanl2> the awesome part of amazon prime is i can watch streams of thursday night football 
gamess 

[16:21] <toooldforgaming> I've not seen his calves, I'm talking about how to tell if somebody lifted or not 
[16:21] <kozatof> @ratchefanl2 how 

[16:22] <kekon3> they’re fungis, as in pretty cool dudes Kappa 
[16:22] <micgelo09> tear off the posters on the walls 
[16:22] <ratchefanl2> being an amazon prime meber kozatof 

[16:22] <darkone667> sometimes very fat people have huge calves doesnt mean they ever liften 
[16:22] <kozatof> @ratchefanl2 I am 

[16:22] <encelor> did phil sign up for youtube/nintedo thing where phil can monitize nintendo vids but only get 
a part of it? 

[16:22] <eternia_forever> @DarkOne667 yeah maybe phil has 20 inch calves @Too01dForGaming 



[16:22] <ratchefanl2> kozatof its NFL thrusday night football 

[16:22] <kozatof> @ratchefanl2 yeah 

[16:22] <blue_blur64> no encelor because it's a stupid thing 

[16:22] <djrunol> fat people do have to lift their body the whole day so i guess that counts? 

[16:22] <ratchefanl2> ah okyou knew already 

[16:22] <toooldforgaming> The quickest body muscles that decay is the biceps and obliques 
[16:23] <vashyoyo> Jump off again :D 
[16:23] <vashyoyo> leap of faith 

[16:23] <encelor> @blue_blur64 its stupid that he is not getting anything for the ivdeo at all :P 
[16:23] <toooldforgaming> The muscles that decay the slowest is calves and shoulders/back muscles 
[16:23] <doctorzzz> go up top with lighing 
[16:23] <encelor> might aswell get a smaller cut 
[16:23] <encelor> money is money 

[16:23] <vashyoyo> you done nothing phil theres 100 more moons to collect 
[16:23] <eternia_forever> dat music 

[16:23] <dragonsky878> @darthradovanviking what made you think davi was a troll? 

[16:23] <toooldforgaming> Fat people are fat 

[16:23] <kekon3> I wasn’t paying attention, has phil talked to the lonely man on the bench? 

[16:23] <blue_blur64> It takes 3 days usually for the video to be monetized @encelor 

[16:23] <doctorzzz> thats bass 

[16:23] <toooldforgaming> Fat does not mean muscle 

[16:23] <i_came_here_to_something> BASS guitarist 

[16:24] <toooldforgaming> Chris Farley was a fat man who lifted 

[16:24] <darthradovanviking> we are not having this discussion @dragonsky878 Either PM me or stop talking

[16:30] <kekon3> If you ever are interested in learning Tekken 7 OpieOP 
[16:30] <dragonsky878> Tekken 7 feat. Akuma = Hadouken spam 
[16:30] <kekon3> I'm right here bro OpieOP

[16:30] <doctorzzz> ITs a zipper 

[16:31] <eternia_forever> good online play perhaps 

[16:31] <straightcashhomie29> Phil do you like this game 

[16:31] <kinggoken> lmao a child 

[16:31] <kekon3> Remember Noah? the actual 8 year old who made it into top 16 at several Marvel 3 tourneys 
[16:32] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil In marvel you were one of the only people not using dante ultron and 

gamora.even in the pro tourneys you see the same 5 characters, ultron dante gamora and sometimes jedah and 

racoon 

[16:32] <kekon3> because all he did was abuse Hulk's armor? 




[16:32] <vashyoyo> street graffiti in mario 

[16:32] <thatanonybear> Dante and RaccAttack is still best MVCI team 
[16:33] <novaenforcer> lmfao 

[16:33] <dragonsky878> @darksydephil what can you say about Hyper Street Fighter 2 anniversary? thats one of 
my favorite street fighter games, ken’s my main :3 

[16:33] <kekon3> funnily enough, the people who played Skullgirls are the oones doominating infinite rn, not 
the people who played Marvel 3 OpieOP 

[16:34] <kuroxroku> @hobbsl017 thats how all fighters start out. Remember in MvC3 Wesker was top tier at 
first? At the end of the game, no one really played him. 

[16:34] <toooldforgaming> Turbo 2 sucks, the best in the series objectively is Street Fighter Alpha 3,1 mean if 
it's not your favorite that's cool but it was the last SF before it got up it's ass in stuff 
[16:34] <novaenforcer> definitely why ppl play fighting games lol 
[16:34] <novaenforcer> for the ’Fame" lol 

[16:34] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil yea very true.... then you got games like guilty gear you have to play 
hundreds of hours to be good at. the only ppl who do good in tourneys play 16 hours a day 
[16:34] <vashyoyo> hat jump? 

[16:34] <thatanonybear> @NovaEnforcer you an FGC guy? 

[16:34] <kekon3> Tekken 7 has good footsies, risk reward and mixup game without feeling too cheesy (Save for 

3 characters) but I think they're taking too long to make new characters 

[16:34] <dragonsky878> @toooldforgaming i love that game, i love using Sakura 

[16:34] <novaenforcer> @ThatAnonyBear nah not really 

[16:35] <toooldforgaming> Yeah Alpha 3 the only way to do bad is to be bad 

[16:35] <nerozero88> Kreygasm Kreygasm 

[16:35] <thatanonybear> @NovaEnforcer hmm, i just know there's a "Nova" from the fgc :P 
[16:35] <hobbsl017> @kuroXroku yea but marvels been out for awhile now and even in Canada cup last week 
there was only like 5 matches on the last day with no ultron gamora dante.... and only 2 matches with those same 
and no coon and jedah 
[16:35] <matitoooo> lol 

[16:35] <kekon3> I tell this to everyone I play when they ask, I wouldn't play Tekken 7 if I didn't just straight up 
enjoy it 

[16:35] <vashyoyo> heh 

[16:35] <thebigjeffproducktions> i bet you get a secret moon for cleaning up all the goop 

[16:35] <dragonsky878> TPFufun 

[16:35] <thebigjeffproducktions> oops nvm 

[16:35] <lvlpower> the power of the Moon 

[16:35] <kaxey> Give her the Donk! Kreygasm 

[16:36] <novaenforcer> plenty of people with the name Nova unfortunately :Z 

[16:36] <kuroxroku> @hobbsl017 its barely been out 2 months. That's a flash in the lifespan of a fighter. 

[16:36] <vashyoyo> noo lmao 
[16:36] <encelor> new porn? 

[16:36] <toooldforgaming> Tekken 7 is amazingly balanced 
[16:36] <vashyoyo> time for donk lesson 

[16:36] <toooldforgaming> I've not seen anything game breaking 

[16:36] <hobbsl017> @kuroXroku its been enough time tho for the pro players to play non stop and see who the 
best characters are 

[16:36] <kekon3> The most game breaking thing is EFWG and even that has a hard counter 

[16:36] <iconicchristian> cheerlOO Hello Why did you start putting Thumbnails on your Video I'm just curious 

[16:36] <hobbsl017> the pro players know those are the top tier guys 

[16:37] <toooldforgaming> Not like say street fighter where some chars are objectively overpowered like 
Fei-Long etc 

[16:37] <blue_blur64> HERE WE GO GUYS Kreygasm 
[16:37] <lvlpower> dance time 



[16:37] <soliddave> Best part of the game

[16:38] <thatanonybear> be my one-up fox. Miles RaccAttack 

[16:38] <kuroxroku> @hobbsl017 yeah, but again, thats just the stuff that works early on. people find new tech 
all the time. Plus, when problem teams arise, people start to work on counters. Towards the end of MvC3, we 
saw people make teams designed to counter MorriDoom. Gotta give it time to evolve and for new tech to emerge. 
[16:39] <kekon3> don't lewd the fox >:(

again, at the recent tourney some guy was 175 grand.and even the person who got 8th place won like 6 grand. 

there is so much money in it. justin wong won like 17 grand and only got like 3rd or 4th 

[16:52] <kekon3> phil’s favorite

[16:53] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil its a shame you were pro during the no money days

[16:54] <doctorzzz> D: 

[16:55] <eternia_forever> yeah 

[16:55] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil even 10th place won a few thousand 

[16:55] <vashyoyo> theres new doors that opened up here 

[16:55] <kekon3> god I wish I could enter tourneys where 10th makes money 

[16:55] <hobbsl017> @DarksydePhil yea very true they play all day.... Fchamp and some even admitted to 
taking adderall and playing 20 hours a day 




[16:55] <kekon3> but that's the nationals, where the cost to enter is mad high FeelsBadMan 
[16:55] <pacifistoOoOo> @doctorzzz is nuts! 

[16:55] <thatanonybear> @hobbsl017 how much is that after his travel expenses and time lost from work? 
[16:56] <doctorzzz> go ask toad 
[16:56] <vashyoyo> other side i think 

[16:56] <hobbsl017> @Kekon3 yea Tekken doesnt make that much money, only the top 3-5 in tekken make 

money and its always the same J apanese players or koreans 

[16:56] <paddingtonbearl87> @thatanonybear like 10 bucks 

[16:56] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 

[16:56] <thatanonybear> LUL 

[16:56] <pl4guet4stic> Phil is bringing up a fair point though, not only does it require a lot of time to become a 
pro player, which Phil doesn’t have if he intends to play hot new releases. And it also takes a lot of money to 
travel to tournaments, hotels, food, etc. 

[16:56] <hobbsl017> @ThatAnonyBear well the better pro players get sponsored so they travel for free, like 

punk is on PG and justin wong is on echo fox etc 

[16:56] <kekon3> still, that'll never deter me from playing, VoHiYo 

[16:56] <bernielomax517> Ooof 

[16:56] <gezavolaj> LUL There GRILL Just Twerking On Twitch, WTF:

[16:57] <doctorzzz> has he found the dog from the pic ? 

[16:57] <vashyoyo> lol just wait haha 

[16:57] <thatanonybear> @hobbsl017 and war veterans are starving on the streets v_v 

[16:57] <hobbsl017> @PL4GUET4STIC yea some of the top players get sponsored but yea all they play is 

street fighter at least 16-20 hours a day 

[16:57] <vashyoyo> explore ground level for more new doors 

[16:57] <thatanonybear> 16-24 hours?? ewww 

[16:57] <hobbsl017> Injustice has a good chunk of sponsored players to 

[16:57] <pl4guet4stic> @hobbsl017 exactly, which is sort of impossible for Phil in his current lifestyle, I 
imagine. 

[16:58] <hobbsl017> but Tekken its mainly koreans and japs who are sponsored not too many USA players for 
tekken 

[16:58] <micgelo09> maybe the coins are in the trees you mightve missed @DarksydePhil 
[16:58] <vashyoyo> you missed a good secret door D;

[17:19] <blue_blur64> I learned that there's a lot of collectibles in Forces. After getting all the red rings, there's 
number rings and silver moon rings you have to collect in each stage 

[17:20] <blue_blur64> There's a lot of replaying to do, but I’ve gotten pretty skilled at some of these levels, like 

beating stage 3 in less than a minute :P 

[17:21] <thatanonybear> that's impressive blur PogChamp 

[17:21] <blue_blur64> The speed running part is honestly a lot of fun, trying to perfect how you move. Let's you 
see there is more to the level than on first glance
