[19:43] <methr011ins> BOONE 

[19:43] <darksydephil> i even suspect about 15 or so more in the next day 
[19:43] <jannedaarcl35> no >.< 

[19:44] <darksydephil> thank you brodie! 

[19:44] <nightqueen> ill hopefully sub next week, whenever my twitch prime renews 
[19:44] <acelp_> What was the subs at before the drop? :/ 

[19:44] <jannedaarcl35> Let’s do the time warp again- 

[19:44] <darksydephil> thanks NightQueen , literally anything right now really helps 
[19:45] <darksydephil> subs were up to 308 yesterday before the drop 
[19:45] <kekon3> btw phil 

[19:45] <darksydephil> so we lost over 20, because more people subbed today, probably around 30 total 
[19:45] <jannedaarcl35> Damn, that does hurt >.> 

[19:45] <majinboo3> Jeanie may is MIA 
[19:45] <thatanonybear> that’s $55 :/ 

[19:45] <acelp_> Damn :/ 

[19:45] <kekon3> whatre the next new games you're doing here? 

[19:45] <sethl89> yoyo wassup everyone 

[19:45] <majinboo3> DAmn you gonna need to make Choice chamber a weekly stream to get these trolls to sub 
lol 

[19:45] <jannedaarcl35> Bloodborne revisit? 

[19:46] <thatanonybear> FF9? NITW? 

[19:46] <sethl89> wait, what's going on? something happen? 

[19:46] <darksydephil> Kekon next new games are: Hidden Agenda, Horizon zero dawn the frozen wilds, the 
upcoming RE7 DLCs, player unknown's battlegrounds, let me know if you pick any of those to do gifs for, so i 
can let you know if its okay 

[19:46] <jannedaarcl35> Although that wouldn't technically be new. Would LOVE to see a FF9 run 

[19:46] <trakooma> Pokemon colosseum lul 

[19:46] <majinboo3> FF9 wont bring in the viewersship 

[19:46] <majinboo3> its too old 

[19:46] <thatanonybear> that's baseless 

[19:46] <majinboo3> these new gamers dont know about the classics 
[19:47] <sethl89> if there's enough requests i don’t see why not 
[19:47] <jannedaarcl35> FF9 is an amazing game though >.> 

[19:47] <kekon3> I'll probably try Hidden Agenda 
[19:47] <thatanonybear> FF9 is brilliant 
[19:47] <kekon3> FF9 is up there for me 

[19:47] <jannedaarcl35> I was hoping Phil would do a FF12 run, but he never got the chance :( 

[19:47] <kekon3> I like FFX a lot oddly enough 

[19:47] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Phil Rules 

[19:47] <speed8711> Devour .... Devour 

[19:47] <thatanonybear> my copy of FFX was stolen :D

the RETURN of DrunkSydePhil in a special December Holiday Marathon! http://www.patreon.com/darksydephil 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> being safe means you SHOULD pledge to get a nomination for the marathon 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> because you're guranteed a nomination 

[19:49] <majinboo3> I still dont understand what the marathon is? Is it just any random game the patreons 
nominate 

[19:49] <majinboo3> whats the criteria? 

[19:49] <evokalewatat> @DarksydePhil is the patreon goal listed the ideal amount or...? Im confused since you 
say we’re roughly there and it's in the low 900s. Is that just because of the patreon stuff you mentioned where the 
amount shown is like 10% lower than actual? 

[19:50] <butter_my_bread> what about drinking games TPFufun 

[19:50] <thatanonybear> he could play Elf Bowling :P 
[19:50] <thatanonybear> a Flash classic 

[19:50] <majinboo3> hes gonna need to play Home Alone for Snes that game was ASS 
[19:50] <sethl89> so will these games be played in one sitting or ever a few days? 

[19:50] <thatanonybear> @Sethl89 one sitting

coming from a Christmas tree, so i’ll pledge for that RlyTho 

[19:51] <thatanonybear> one marathon where he gets sloshed and games for 8 hours or so iirc

[19:53] <butter_my_bread> besides the Halloween one was a shit sandwich 

[19:53] <jannedaarcl35> dspWowdude 

[19:53] <popsicolo> Put a goal meter on prestream so people can see it. 

[19:53] <butter_my_bread> MindManners 

[19:53] <sirnoblex> That's a good idea 
[19:53] <sirnoblex> Actually 

[19:53] <thatanonybear> @Popsicolo here's a thinking man 

[19:53] <neospartanhesperos9> Popsi has the right idea 

[19:53] <majinboo3> I wonder how many subs the top tier of twitch have 



[19:53] <butter_my_bread> im sawwwwy markHeart 

[19:54] <majinboo3> proably 10s of thousands 

[19:54] <neospartanhesperos9> like every streamer on Twitch LUL 

[19:54] <popsicolo> CarlSmile 

[19:54] <neospartanhesperos9> use the meter LUL 

[19:54] <popsicolo> I need 200 followers to get an achievement. popsicSmug 

[19:54] <evokalewatat> @DarksydePhil been rewatching old dsp tries it. have you considered doing a top set of 
best and worst things youve ever had or is it all so trash tier you couldnt be fucked to discern a worst thing? 
[19:54] <trakooma> have a subscriber counter 

[19:54] <evokalewatat> @majinboo3 ive seen some top tier moba ones have allegedly ~20k 
[19:54] <evokalewatat> eg singsing is roughly that 

[19:54] <neospartanhesperos9> Well popsi, there are two-hundred viewers here... OpieOP 

[19:54] <thatanonybear> Everyone follow Popsi popsicSmug 

[19:55] <ninthgrove> hello phil 

[19:55] <thatanonybear> NITW 

[19:55] <kekon3> Nier Automata Kappa 

[19:55] <trakooma> put sub count on screen to motivate people to sub 
[19:55] <popsicolo> You guys PogChamp 
[19:55] <sethl89> i got u homie 

[19:55] <popsicolo> @DarksydePhil Put a meter onscreen during prestream so people have a visual incentive. 
[19:55] <majinboo3> wtf? 

[19:55] <sethl89> @Popsicolo that's actually a good idea 

[19:55] <neospartanhesperos9> Shadow the Hedgehog is a sonic game OpieOP 

[19:56] <0megaj0ker> What other Sonic games are there again? 

[19:56] <majinboo3> So paytrons determine the event but the twitch subs determine if you do the event? 

[19:56] <ltpenguin22> Yeah I can already see that plan failing 

[19:56] <sweatybackwheelz> luptime 

[19:56] <gabriel_ko> Ia€™ll give you my $5 Prime sub! 

[19:56] <popsicolo> Shadow x Shrek is my OTP 
[19:56] <thatanonybear> that's a p great idea 

[19:56] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil needs a Gameboy Advanced to play Sonic Advance 3 dspPepe 
[19:56] <sweatybackwheelz> Wut 

[19:56] <popsicolo> Streamlabs has a setting where you can put a meter onscreen. 

[19:57] <trakooma> put a sub counter phil 

[19:57] <butter_my_bread> no sweat off my sack 

[19:57] <encelor> hey guys 

[19:57] <0megaj0ker> Stream labs causes Phila€™s OBS to crash 
[19:57] <popsicolo> Muxy probably has it too. 

[19:57] <sethl89> hey encelor 

[19:57] <neospartanhesperos9> is gabriel ko kinggokken 
[19:57] <encelor> how are you guys 
[19:58] <sethl89> doin aight, you? 

[19:58] <suckasurprise> Is there some twitch app thing you can use to put a sub count under your stream? 

[19:58] <evokalewatat> @DarksydePhil recommend against the sub meter, friend of mine used it and it caused 

oeople to without subs to try and get that coveted 200th sub and fucked them for a bit 

[19:58] <encelor> @Sethl89 good my self thanks 

[19:58] <neospartanhesperos9> Not enough submarines PogChamp 

[19:58] <sethl89> you're welcome, that's good to hear 

[19:59] <sweatybackwheelz> How rude 

[19:59] <popsicolo> Well if Phil did use a meter it would be in service of a goal like enabling an event, as 
opposed to just hittting a number. 

[19:59] <sethl89> A exactly 



[19:59] <thatanonybear> @evokalewatat that's silly and we can work around that 

[19:59] <butter_my_bread> living in their pockets 

[19:59] <evokalewatat> eh, just speaking from experience tis all 
[19:59] <gabriel_ko> That sounds stupid 

[19:59] <evokalewatat> a totally live counter can be counterproductive is all 

[19:59] <encelor> i missed to much of warframes event gotta grind hard lacR 

[19:59] <thatanonybear> being sub number 200 doesnt really mean anything anyways 

[20:00] <evokalewatat> yeah 

[20:00] <popsicolo> It’s a fair point nonetheless evo 

[20:00] <evokalewatat> im just saying that people 

[20:00] <evokalewatat> just go for arbitrary badges of honor 

[20:00] <suckasurprise> Tell us what it is now 

[20:00] <evokalewatat> and as a result, withold subs 

[20:00] <majinboo3> You won the lotto?

[20:04] <evokalewatat> @DarksydePhil you considered a stream where you cook the italian sauce and just leave

[20:11] <butter_my_bread> @dutchvanderlinde i think they're gonna reduce SoT for SMGs across the board, i 

thi nk that'll help the game to not turn into a melt simulator

cods online, im a new fan 

[20:19] <thatanonybear> Hitler's name will be remembered long after the men who defeated him. 

[20:19] <afarcryaway> Phil, you could play Hardcore, lower TTK would make it a bit more rewarding for 
shooting first :D 

[20:20] <pinkdam> at least 100 trillion poor souls died at the hands of that madman hitler 
[20:20] <encelor> didn’t hitler just kill him self to grief his team? 

[20:20] <sethl89> yeah what farcry said i mean hardcore you'll get killed faster but you will kill faster in return 

[20:20] <butter_my_bread> really cool all the user generated in Treyarch games markHug 

[20:20] <blacksunblood> when dsp kills you

fan of the franchise in general anymore tbh 

[20:20] <pinkdam> he killed himself cos he had ran out of anyone else to kill 
[20:20] <afarcryaway> Hitler is the type of guy to drown himself in World of Tanks

his squeeze

[20:38] <djrunol> uhhh... is this even a server? i thought it was matchmaking 

[20:38] <popsicolo> NotLikeThis 

[20:38] <nightbot> Farkin bullshot just tipped $1.00 

[20:38] <conky89> Nowaday's Infinity Ward is a joke. With their fish AI and emotional inducing dogs 

[20:38] <jannedaarcl35> He farted out a guy 

[20:38] <afarcryaway> I wonder what Treyarch's next game will be 

[20:38] <elite878> Spawned out his asshole lol 

[20:38] <psvfan94> Did anyone play WAW: Final Fronts? Why a horrendous call of duty 

[20:38] <scoopula> @DJRunol It's peer-to-peer matchmaking so it's luck of the draw if you get a host in india 

[20:38] <neospartanhesperos9> Infinity Ward all the way baby KappaRoss / 

[20:38] <thespiccoli> @AFarCryAway blops iv 
[20:38] <afarcryaway> xD 

[20:38] <thatindieglo> I dona€™t think they can fix this donkey Doo Doo of a game 

[20:39] <butter_my_bread> phil loved Black Ops 3 until he got a rude awakening of the higher skill cap 

CrreamAwk 

[20:39] <afarcryaway> @theSpiccoli you're probably right xD 

[20:39] <djrunol> someone should tell phil that he doesnt play on an actual server 

[20:39] <elite878> @afarcryaway I've a feeling Vietnam cod 

[20:39] <djrunol> @PSVfan94 yes i played it on my ps2. man was i disappointed 

[20:39] <butter_my_bread> his beta n launch coverage was enjoyable 

[20:39] <encelor> i need to get more sleeping pills my insomnia is starting been acting past few weeks 

[20:39] <two_bar_king> that means u have good internet to have a bad connection ur carrying every one else on 

connection 

[20:39] <neospartanhesperos9> WRONG 



[20:39] <encelor> well i typed that like a caveman 
[20:39] <encelor> Kappa 

[20:40] <afarcryaway> Vietnam Cod could be wonderful, but after playing a lot of Rising Storm 2 I want 

something else haha 

[20:40] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[20:40] <djrunol> phil that was like 5m xD

sleeping as I work shifts. It's like nearly 4 am here as I type lol 

[20:40] <conky89> In real life, Shotguns actually have an effective range of a pistol 

[20:40] <psvfan94> If you want a true Vietnam game play Shellshock EleGiggle 

[20:41] <chairmancaleb> @Elite878 I like my brain. 

[20:41] <encelor> @Elite878 i tried but it does not work on me 

[20:41] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil, shotguns in Battlefield shoot farther than that, uh, true story CoolStoryBob 
[20:41] <thatindieglo> Depends if the gauge 

[20:41] <eckuk2> shotgun beats sniper rifle, just ask the father of sniping 

[20:41] <sethl89> its 11:42 pm where i am lol 

[20:41] <encelor> i just gain weight when i start any kind of weed 

[20:41] <supersl8> no shit, you are an idiot if you bought the hype... its just another reskinned cod 
[20:41] <thespiccoli> Is battlefront the better purchase?

[20:52] <thatanonybear> cheerlO arent you glad you paid so you can play the maps you dont like 

[20:52] <afarcryaway> Yeah 9 maps at launch was a bad move

[20:53] <extracheeez> when the fuck did germans invade London? 

[20:53] <afarcryaway> They did bomb it 

[20:53] <thatanonybear> @Butter_My_Bread like Splatoon 2? 

[20:53] <butter_my_bread> it's just how the cookie crumbles dood 

[20:53] <elite878> @sanvilla93 that cannon map is a literally back out. Let's all head to the cannon and snipe,

[20:54] <super_slade> Didn’t you see Bedknobs and Broomsticks? Of course they invaded London 

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> @sanvilla93 Let's not use that word. We don’t know what cancer is really like, so 

let's not use it for trivial things like games. dspPepe 

[20:54] <butter_my_bread> that conservative playstyle 

[20:54] <encelor> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 too bad i do know how cancer is like 

[20:55] <butter_my_bread> passive play is all this game is. play bo3 where u aren’t punished for being 

aggressive

[20:56] <encelor> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 yup the reason i got 1 testicle LUL 

[20:56] <psvfan94> If they wanted this game to be realistic they should have added the Channel Islands rather 
than London docks 

[20:56] <neospartanhesperos9> @encelor are you joking or not 

[20:56] <afarcryaway> Phil plays a lot better when he’s calm. When he looses his shit he starts sprinting around 



corners without his gun up 
[20:56] <encelor> not joking

[20:57] <jannedaarcl35> dspNothing 

[20:57] <elite878> @popsicolo tbh they should rename the map " docks of LondonStan "

[20:57] <thatanonybear> Im sawwy

[21:05] <super_slade> Spiccoli you need those bits for classroom pizza 
[21:05] <popsicolo> Phil's overqualified. 

[21:05] <thespiccoli> kotaku is sjw 

[21:05] <elite878> Yea I didn’t expect anything else. It's cod. I can waste couple hours on it now and again then 

put it down. The good days of the franchise are well gone 

[21:05] <eckuk2> kotaku and polygon are two of the worst gaming sites 

[21:05] <encelor> every journalism is SJW nowadays 

[21:05] <thatanonybear> kotaku has an article about COD/Anime memes 

[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> more like kotakPUU

[21:05] <breath321> @patrickcl0 It isn’t 

[21:05] <patrickcl0> Phil is only bad at it when he's not patient 

[21:05] <butter_my_bread> Bear still pining for NITW stream lol 

[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> fRITZ 

[21:05] <eckuk2> i like giantbomb yeah they're good. I think they employed some feminist chick recently though 
[21:06] <encelor> its because bear wants a night in the woods with his lover 
[21:06] <jannedaarcl35> damn sjw's 

[21:06] <extracheeez> cheerlOO This game looks and plays like it's 10 years old. Where's the innovation? 

[21:06] <thatanonybear> @Butter_My_Bread It’ll happen 

[21:06] <elite878> @patrickcl0 that's what I'm saying it's playable but it's not exactly memorable

[21:07] <patrickcl0> The maps could be better, there could be more of them, bust most of Phil's complaints hold 

no merit. The majority of kills he doesn't get are due to him legitimately poorly aiming and not realizing it. He 

only dies a lot when he gets annoyed and impatient. He is decent at the game when he is patient 

[21:07] <xthetrashcanman> they ripped this from Overwatch 

[21:07] <paddingtonbearl87> would someone PLZ EXPLAIN THAT

Nigra 

[21:08] <kevingunn3r> hey everyone 

[21:08] <patrickclO> I’m a fan of Phil's gameplay so it disappoints me when he blames the game for things he is 
at fault for. Plus if he wants 1-2 hit kills he needs to play hardcore, Call of Duty has never been a game meant to 
be realistic. You are supposed to get a lot of kills/deaths. If he doesn't like the base Call of Duty formula that's 
fine, but that's what COD is.

[21:24] <patrickclO> @Breath321 Very true haha but with Phil's aim I wouldn’t rely on him going for headshots

[21:24] <jannedaarcl35> What would Nagito do at a time like this? 

[21:24] <theravenorg> where are the lootboxes

like Phil does. I'm a fan of Phil but he needs to realize COD is not meant to be realistic lol

[21:26] <jannedaarcl35> he just killed country gurl >.< 

[21:26] <patrickclO> @Breath321 100% agree that's my gripe when he blames the game. And @Elite878 
exactly if you are expecting super realistic gameplay and barely any death with COD you are not going to have a 
fun time haha. It’s enjoyable if you just relax and play it for what it is

[21:28] <patrickclO> As someone who enjoys the COD series and hasn't enjoyed the last few years of COD's, 
sledgehammer did a good job with WW2. Not amazing by any means and it has its issues but the constant 
blaming of sledgehammer for things that have been standard for the COD formula for years is silly lol 
[21:28] <paddingtonbearl87> true 
[21:28] <jannedaarcl35> build that wall 

[21:28] <pinkdam> wow this sledgehammer shill sure can type 

[21:28] <paddingtonbearl87> there has been shit thats been in cod forever 

[21:28] <kevingunn3r> I certainly think they somewhat redeemed themselves after advanced warfare 
[21:28] <jannedaarcl35> make country gurl pay for it 

[21:28] <patrickclO> I think Phil just doesn’t enjoy COD period, that's not WW2's fault 
[21:28] <extracheeez> can you troll by destroying your own team's shit? 

[21:28] <afarcryaway> @patrickclO you're not wrong

[21:32] <patrickcl0> @Pinkdam Just offering my opinion, I have enjoyed Phil since 2009. Just sharing my 
opinion as I feel the hate on the game is due to him not liking COD formula in general not ww2. Sorry if it seems 
like I'm trying to shill something, not intended that way

for this game... 

[21:33] <conky89> The plus side of lower graphic fidelity is that the game performance increases

[21:38] <orcsrdorks7> Spongebob was my teen years 

[21:38] <patrickclO> I think Activision is to blame primarily. I don’t think they've given the developers much 

creative control for years. I bet they demanded lootboxes too, but who knows for sure 

[21:38] <byeah_345> is this a full lobby? seems a bit too LOW ENERGY

[21:38] <breath321> nothing you could do 

[21:38] <afarcryaway> New Spongebob has been pretty bad from what little I've watched, but those older 
episodes had some good moral lessons and such 

[21:38] <popsicolo> Phil's character did a lil dance before he hit the ground. CarlSmile 
[21:38] <paddingtonbearl87> while the enemy laughed and killed him 

[21:39] <pinkdam> why couldn’t this be a bloody army men game instead of donning the shroud of ww2 to then 
clown around in, cap in hand for microtransaction money 

[21:39] <elite878> @patrickclO it's definitely the publishers of these games who put pressure on the devs. They 

expect a return on their outlay. This is business 

[21:39] <jannedaarcl35> yeahhhhh 

[21:39] <jannedaarcl35> destroy dem guns guns guns 

[21:39] <thespiccoli> How many kills is he up to? 

[21:39] <breath321> I don’t even care about microtransactions, I'll gladly spend more money in a game if I love 
it, but the problem is lootbox, when I buy something I want what I want, not some random chance to get 
something I wanted 

[21:39] <paddingtonbearl87> damn these matches r long 
[21:39] <paddingtonbearl87> @thespiccoli 50 CarlSmile

[21:40] <jannedaarcl35> prolly more than 15 

[21:40] <breath321> as long as the microtransactions aren’t pay to win obviously 

[21:40] <afarcryaway> Phil's best line sometimes comes into my mind, "Don’t worry I'm not dead, but I wish I 
fucking was" XD 

[21:40] <thespiccoli> @JanneDaArcl35 this one is for 25 
[21:40] <paddingtonbearl87> k not 50 but im sure its high 
[21:40] <jannedaarcl35> ah, okay, not sure then/ 

[21:40] <patrickcl0> @Elite878 Definitely. Publishers controlling developers is a massive problem in gaming 
and in popular series like this in general. Let's not forget Activision's business practices were responsible for 
running guitar hero into the ground long ago, not the developers who made the games

[21:42] <patrickcl0> @Pinkdam Not saying it's not the developers fault, we have no idea. But I definitely can 
see Activision being a horrible company to develop games under

[21:43] <mikej254> Is he playing with viewers 
[21:43] <butter_my_bread> na 

[21:43] <pinkdam> well if they will do anything for money, they are at fault...

[21:43] <jannedaarcl35> StoneLightning 

[21:43] <butter_my_bread> i didn’t buy the game but i am concerned about Treyarch's game as per usual 

[21:43] <breath321> @Pinkdam I mean, it's exactly the same as EA buying studios like Visceral and Respawn, 
are you really gonna refuse millions of dollars? no. 

[21:44] <patrickclO> Ethically I agree yeah. But this is a problem in gaming, movies, etc sadly 

[21:44] <encelor> laser weapons lootbox only 

[21:44] <pinkdam> yeah they could put, say, a ray gun in the game 

[21:44] <patrickclO> Unfortunately money talks

people buy it regardless of quality 

[21:48] <paddingtonbearl87> keep spraying ur bound to get a kill CoolStoryBob 

[21:48] <elite878> @afarcryaway he banned me last week for literally nothing lol. I still like him and just watch 
him without talking now 

[21:48] <encelor> pass the marshmellows to phil LUL 
[21:48] <suckasurprise> Phil really wants those bits 

[21:49] <afarcryaway> @Elite878 He is a very sensitive person, not saying what he did was justified though xD 
[21:49] <pinkdam> no, but who cares about call of duty? spend your money on a better game, reward those who 
cater for your niche taste 

[21:49] <thatanonybear> @suckasurprise Who wouldnt? 

[21:49] <breath321> @Elite878 Even some of the mods are pretty paranoid about chat, like anything that sounds 
remotely insulting of Phil will get banned really quickly 

[21:49] <elite878> @afarcryaway nah I understand I held no grudge. I've war him for good few years now. 

[21:49] <pinkdam> and when your niche game becomes popular and in all likelihood becomes more like call of 
duty to chase the money, repeat the process and find another 

[21:49] <afarcryaway> @Breath321 I think he was talking about Wings of Redemption 
[21:50] <thatanonybear> @Elite878 on a different account or something? 

[21:50] <patrickcl0> COD would likely only be drastically improved if mass amounts of people stopped buying 
it in protest, but then Activision would likely just claim there is no longer interest in COD and cease publishing 
the game instead of giving developers more time and creative freedom. Sadly. 

[21:50] <thatanonybear> or unbanned? 

[21:50] <coleworldnorubber> what game mode is this ? 



[21:50] <breath321> @AFarCryAway Ah, I really dislike that guy 
[21:50] <suckasurprise> @ThatAnonyBear Point taken tpYGOcreepy

[21:50] <afarcryaway> @Breath321 He has issues, but he seems cool when he’s not having his breakdowns. 
We’re all human with quirks so I can see past it I guess 

[21:50] <pinkdam> what you consider an improvement might not necessarily be considered as such by the 
average call of duty player 

[21:51] <breath321> @AFarCryAway I don’t know his attitude and demeanor are extremely annoying to me, he 
just has a rude personality or something 

[21:51] <thatanonybear> @Elite878 sorry :(i'm always a step behind 
[21:51] <thatanonybear> *sawwy 

[21:51] <patrickcl0> Fair point @Pinkdam . Like I’ve said I actually enjoy WW2 more than previous COD's, but

[21:53] <paddingtonbearl87> wow 

[21:53] <jannedaarcl35> how many kills right now? 

[21:53] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Is Phil playing la noire? 

[21:53] <butter_my_bread> @breath321 he is.im friends with him on psn and he’s pretty irritable n a very sore 

loser. 

[21:53] <patrickcl0> @Breath321 As you can see he frustrates the hell out of me with his blaming of the games 
for no reason lol. I started watching him in 7th grade in 08-09. Don’t participate in community much but I'm 21 
now and still follow him. Genuinely well intentioned guy but he has his flaws. Plus his life isn’t the greatest. I 
always just hope to see people be happy including him 
[21:53] <paddingtonbear!87> hes checking score lmao InuyoFace 



[21:54] <heybosspossi> dspNothing 
[21:54] <encelor> who don’t want 2000 bits tho 
[21:54] <encelor> LUL 

[21:54] <elite878> @breath321 I can't defend some things he says but I think a lot of his anger comes from 

issues with his life and himself. On his good days he’s a great laugh. I try have compassion for him 

[21:54] <afarcryaway> @patrickclO I feel the same way 

[21:54] <thespiccoli> Whats he up to lads 

[21:54] <trihard41iife> @patrickclO i feel the same way 

[21:54] <breath321> @patrickclO yeah Phil has a toxic mentality, his "Nothing I could do" thing is a funny 
meme but is a really bad mentality to have 
[21:54] <paddingtonbearl87> 17 
[21:55] <suckasurprise> he has 17 killls? 

[21:55] <afarcryaway> As someone who has had a gaming addiction and weight issues with depression, I really 
empathize with Wings at times. But sometimes he's a real cunt 
[21:55] <paddingtonbearl87> oh boy 

[21:55] <patrickclO> A lot of shit with Phil is self inflicted, but his intentions are pure I believe. That's why I try 
to support him and don't hate on him, it won't help him at all and his life isn't the best. I root for him to overcome 
everything but it does come back to his mindset a lot of the time 
[21:55] <two_bar_king> happy hard to see from video 
[21:55] <psvfan94> All terminators lol 

[21:55] <pinkdam> dsp isn't actually blaming anything @patrickclO he just has to say something most every 
time he dies/loses in a game, it's a reflex that comes from playing fighting games IRL and the sensitivity it 
imparts when the guy who beat you is right next to you 

[21:55] <kushiyakitori> as soon as he checked his score his playing got worse this match, maybe flanking will 
help? 

[21:55] <bobbi_ling> yall buying cod in 2017 LUL 

[21:55] <pinkdam> admitting it was your fault is a sign of weakness and socially unacceptable 
[21:55] <vilky_p> phil staying up this late 
[21:55] <encelor> bobbi was here all this time? 

[21:55] <encelor> LUL 

[21:56] <jannedaarcl35> thats right, nobody fucks with the jesus 
[21:56] <vilky_p> not this map again 
[21:56] <bobbi_ling> i was cooking LUL 

[21:56] <thatanonybear> he's providing commentary, of course he's gonna respond to dying 
[21:56] <popsicolo> Phil's really hustling here. 

[21:56] <patrickclO> @AFarCryAway @TriHard4Liife Awesome to see others feel the same. 

[21:56] <thespiccoli> I thi nk thats 22 
[21:56] <encelor> the Hustle LUL 
[21:56] <thespiccoli> 24 
[21:56] <jannedaarcl35> hes there 
[21:56] <jannedaarcl35> si ckise 
[21:56] <encelor> phil is a workhorse 

[21:56] <breath321> @ThatAnonyBear That's fair enough, but, the commentary itself is him blaming stuff 
[21:56] <thatanonybear> WORKHORSE ENGAGED 
[21:56] <encelor> he needs that 2000 bits 

[21:57] <thespiccoli> I'll wait until it's over. If he gets 35 I'll do 3000 
[21:57] <trihard41iife> @patrickcl0 btw its mostly multiplayer it's like this tbh 
[21:57] <breath321> he's almost there 

[21:57] <afarcryaway> Like I said early as well, I might not like or agree with everything Phil says, but he's 
human with positive and negative quirks and traits. Can't really be too mad at the guy for giving us free content 
to enjoy 

[21:57] <encelor> he has to ear it 



[21:57] <encelor> earn* 

[21:57] <encelor> LUL 

[21:57] <paddingtonbearl87> hes work whorsing his way to VICTOLY 
[21:57] <kushiyakitori> isn’t he like 1 away? 

[21:57] <popsicolo> Can he do it? PogChamp 

[21:57] <psvfan94> Success in this mode completely depends on squadmate competence

[21:58] <kushiyakitori> he's gotta have it 

[21:58] <popsicolo> The promise of bits turned Phil into Captain America! PogChamp 

[21:58] <thatanonybear> @Breath321 i wouldn’t read too much into the specifics, he sounds like he's having fun 

with it tonight even when he dies 

[21:58] <encelor> @Popsicolo sllverVgolos 

[21:58] <afarcryaway> @Popsicolo xD 

[21:58] <pinkdam> so basically just bear in mind when phil blames X or Y for what just happened it's often a 

displacement activity not a reasoned argument or belief 

[21:58] <elite878> @popsicolo lol 

[21:58] <encelor> suddenly phil aim got better LUL 

[21:58] <heybosspossi> head glitch phil head glitch! dont just run out exposing your entire body 
[21:58] <jannedaarcl35> he destroyed the target kills lol 

[21:58] <breath321> @ThatAnonyBear He's having now I agree, but earlier he was super salty calling the game 

trash, but yeah I get you 

[21:58] <afarcryaway> This music is so tense 

[21:58] <patrickclO> @TriHard4Liife Haha yeah I know, watching him play COD has frustrated me for YEARS 
lol. Since I was a kid. He really could use a change in mentality and mindset but as we can see his life genuinely 
isn't the greatest and with depression and shit I really don't hold it against him. 

[21:58] <breath321> @ThatAnonyBear Having fun now, even 
[21:58] <jannedaarcl35> phil turned into prolevel cod player lol 
[21:59] <psvfan94> Phil loves a double kill with bits on the line
