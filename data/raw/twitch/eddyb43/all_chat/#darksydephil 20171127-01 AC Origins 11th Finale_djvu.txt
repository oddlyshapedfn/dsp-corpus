grinding.

playthrough is too long that's not the games fault 
[14:00] <bobbi_Hng> easily 

[14:00] <theycallmejimbob> Baeoh hype hey Bobbi R)

[14:01] <breath321> That is true, but a lot of people dislike or are apathetic towards Assassin's Creed, if you 

enjoy AC then being long is a pro rather than a con

[16:08] <bethemadeagle> like assassins creed ubisoft was like we are not making the same mistake again like 

unity we will take 2 years for the next assassins creed 

[16:08] <cookiemanster530> If EA owned most gaming properties I would quit gaming.

with dust on it in the back of the cabinet 

[16:29] <bethemadeagle> its not the best but it would be up there 
[16:29] <divanerasmus> they fucked up assisting creed for me with unity 
[16:29] <voltagemax> nier automata is best game for me 
[16:29] <bethemadeagle> i mean horizon could win 
[16:29] <divanerasmus> assisting creed lmao 

[16:29] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Your weapons dona€™t break, better than BOTW so far LUL 
[16:29] <bethemadeagle> shadow of war could win 

[16:30] <bethemadeagle> evil within 2 could win wolfenstein or south park could win 
[16:30] <kjones4140> Glitch 

[16:30] <divanerasmus> @bethemadeagle please no not horizon 
[16:30] <dooley258> Use the hawk 
[16:30] <kjones4140> lol 

[16:30] <majorkyon> I think most critics will go for Mario Odyssey 

[16:30] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ia€™m assuming Odyssey will win GOTY 

[16:30] <majorkyon> Or Horizon or BOTW 

[16:30] <bethemadeagle> divan yes why not 

[16:30] <divanerasmus> @majorkyon you are correct sir 

[16:31] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Judges are nudniks if they don’t pick Knack 2 
[16:31] <bethemadeagle> mario odyssey or breath in the wild could win as well 
[16:31] <bethemadeagle> there is too many 

[16:31] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I personally dona€™t think Zelda is even in the running. 

[16:31] <xkeysx97> Ia€™d love too see phil on a session drinking loads of o shots and getting waisted on a 
stream that would be the best stream ever I would pay top dollar too see that phil make it happen 



[16:31] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ita€™s rigged anyways GOTY 

[16:31] <kurojp> Breath of the Wild gets boring fast, Mario Odyssey is a way better game 

[16:32] <divanerasmus> no horizon is a need for speed nock off seeing how long need for speed has been doing 

it before horizon 

[16:32] <majorkyon> @DivanErasmus I think mr Mod meant Horizon Zero Dawn 
[16:32] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Wasna€™t Nier Automata released this year? 

[16:32] <divanerasmus> really? 

[16:33] <divanerasmus> OK my bad 
[16:33] <majorkyon> Not Forza 
[16:33] <majorkyon> Nier was this year 

[16:33] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I could see Nier make te list and lose 

[16:33] <bethemadeagle> assassins erred origins, mario odyssey, horizon, shadow of war, wolfenstein, evil 

withing 2, persona, nioh, breath in the wild and south park will be top 10 but definitely not in that order 

[16:33] <divanerasmus> I believe Mario oddesy first place then horizon zero dawn 

[16:33] <majorkyon> idk if it's GOTY but it's definitely soundtrack of the year for me Kreygasm 

[16:34] <bethemadeagle> i mean there were others which could snag 10th spot but might not 

[16:34] <blue_blur64> Well Phil gave Zelda a very high score 

[16:34] <arnity> Amazing gameplay 

[16:34] <bethefueg> Black flag 

[16:34] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil it was in black flag phil 
[16:34] <bethefueg> The pirate assassin 

[16:35] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ita€™s gonna be Odyssey Ia€™d bet my left nut 
[16:36] <kjones4140> im white 

[16:36] <bethemadeagle> phil didnt finish persona so him putting hat on top 10 would be bullshit 

[16:37] <xkeysx97> I never even noo assassins creed rouge existed till a few months ago hahahaha thata€™s 

basically the forgotten assassins creed game 

[16:37] <jelseal973> Has Phil finished the main storyline? 

[16:37] <ycea2b> yes 

[16:38] <bethemadeagle> i played assassins creed rogue it was like black flag and that should've been the only 
assassins creed game that year cause fuck unity

[16:49] <kjones4140> @blue_blur64 Bitcoins are electronic currency, otherwise known as 'cryptocurrency'. 
Bitcoins are a form of digital public money that is created by painstaking mathematical computations and policed 
by millions of computer users called 'miners'.Bitcoins are, in essence, electricity converted into long strings of 
code that have money value.
