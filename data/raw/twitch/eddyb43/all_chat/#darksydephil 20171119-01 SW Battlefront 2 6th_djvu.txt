[15:08] <kinggoken> yeah i heard the Xbone has a great controller 
[15:08] <thebigtj 1337> I love how long it takes just to get back to the main menu 
[15:08] <majorkyon> There's barely anything to load 
[15:08] <secretbossfight> Yep! 

[15:08] <djrunol> get moar kreyts son! dem kreyts 

[15:08] <darkvikingl59> @SecretBossFight would not really make a diffrence the game is poorly designed for 
console user which sucks 

[15:08] <aloofone> i use the xbox one controller on the pc its ok 

[15:08] <temoblanks> When are they going to be done fixing BetterTTV. I miss reading deleted messages. 

[15:08] <encelor> he is getting rekt by the contrller sensitivity and auto aim 

[15:08] <secretbossfight> @temoblanks I think the current FFZ beta does that 

[15:08] <segregate> @TemoBlanks it works for me 

[15:09] <djrunol> phil simply does not know how to use aim assist 

[15:09] <kushiyakitori> @TemoBlanks clicking on them works for me 

[15:09] <ncias> uvula 



[15:09] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil maybe try and change the sensitivity? 

[15:09] <butter_my_bread> @teamguardanator I've heard from big streamers n ytubers xbone's a worse so to 

the point they lower their sens 

[15:09] <dukaduka> @TemoBlanks have you tried twitch 5? 

[15:09] <encelor> who wants to see galactic assault? 

[15:09] <itsasp0rki> the bottom line is 

[15:09] <temoblanks> Maybe they fixed it for Chrome, cause im on firefox 

[15:10] <darkvikingl59> no its not phils fault its the game developer because there are so many fps games out 
there that don't have this aiming problem yet this game does dspHmm 

[15:10] <teamguardanator> @Butter_My_Bread I have my sens put to medium and i can still aim good with 

controller, not too fast. 

[15:10] <thebigtjl337> LOADING 

[15:10] <butter_my_bread> it's the shoddy carpenter that blames his tools hehe 

[15:10] <segregate> loading 

[15:10] <kushiyakitori> @TemoBlanks i’m on Firefox too. have bttv and ffz installed and they have some basic 
functionlaity so far 

[15:11] <somethingyer2> i cant wait to get this game in 2 months for 20 bucks 

[15:11] <segregate> LUL 

[15:11] <kinggoken> lol 

[15:11] <darkvikingl59> lol 

[15:11] <segregate> lol 

[15:11] <kinggoken> your probably right, it will be 20 bucks 

[15:11] <encelor> ewakawaka 

[15:11] <welshwizard_30> Jebaited 

[15:11] <kinggoken> I should have waited before I got this 

[15:11] <jakedeesnake> Do Ewok's throw rocks at your head like the first? 

[15:11] <theycallmejimbob> it'll probably be added to Origin Access in 6 months dspHmm 
[15:11] <mayitol990> Ill buy this game when they fix the p2w situation 

[15:12] <kurojp> In 2 months they'll release a "starter edition" that requires even more microtransactions 
[15:12] <secretbossfight> I wish they had characters from the cartoon, but theya€™d look weirdly out of place in 
this cinematic style. Though ita€™d be neat to see realistic-style Zeb & Sabine. 

[15:12] <encelor> @Mayitol990 never happening its EA 
[15:12] <somethingyer2> this game needs jar jar binks or no buy 

[15:12] <neospartanhesperos9> nobody is forcing you to ptw, you can just play the game and earn it 
[15:12] <kinggoken> lol 

[15:12] <darkvikingl59> yup it will @theycallmejimbob i mean look at mass effect andromeda that took 6 
months :p 

[15:12] <atkins_alert> cheese egg sarnie 
[15:12] <encelor> this game needs "who shot first " 

[15:13] <secretbossfight> @neospartanhesperos9 The problem is it eventually leads to some Clash of Clans shit 
where the developer is rewarded by matching you with people who buy a ton of power 
[15:14] <mayitol990> This game will be dead after Christmas 

[15:14] <theycallmejimbob> it did indeed Darkvikingl59 I'm surprised it's so cheap too compared to xbox game 
pass 

[15:14] <dukaduka> @Mayitol990 what other game comes out that's gonna take its place? Destiny 2 die LUL 
[15:15] <secretbossfight> Dead after Christmas? Seems to me a lot of people think it looks alright but wona€™t 
pay $60 for it. 

[15:15] <neospartanhesperos9> @Darkvikingl59 what happened to Andromeda 
[15:15] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Hans shot first, Ca€™mon ita€™s Harrison Ford 

[15:15] <spinbrett> @Mayitol990 is this game worth buying? rate it from 1 to 10 with 10 being a masterpiece 
[15:15] <secretbossfight> Honestly I buy almost nothing at $60 so I dona€™t get this idea that games are always 
dead after two weeks 



[15:15] <dukaduka> @SecretBossFight the same with movies, people love that new car smell LUL 
[15:15] <coolcoollo> 6 

[15:15] <secretbossfight> $60 is a lot for just a couple weeks of entertainment, especially if youa€™re a kid with 
no job 

[15:16] <spinbrett> game looks great...whats wrong with it? 

[15:16] <teamguardanator> 7 
[15:16] <mayitol990> 5/10 

[15:16] <ass_blastor> even if you're an adult, 60 is a lot 

[15:16] <darkvikingl59> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 if you have orgin access you can get the deluxe version for 
free and by the looks of it it seems like when a game is out for 6 months it gets put in the "EA vault" (all the 
games you get with orgin access) 

[15:16] <encelor> redlight district hookers are 20euros 

[15:16] <neospartanhesperos9> @SecretBossFight people who don’t value their money are going to do the 
stupidest shit with it, man. 

[15:16] <encelor> this game is 3 hookers worth 
[15:16] <encelor> LUL 

[15:16] <spinbrett> so whats wrong with this game? i was thinking about getting it 
[15:17] <ass_blastor> 20 dollar for a hooker? you better get tested 
[15:17] <kinggoken> A 

[15:17] <itsaspOrki> i played a better version of this game 13 years ago on ps2 

[15:17] <dukaduka> @Spinbrett nothing is wrong with it right now LUL we’re just not sure what's to come 
[15:17] <encelor> @Ass_Blastor nah its redlight district 

[15:17] <kurojp> 20 dollar hookers have a hard time sucking more than this game 
[15:17] <neospartanhesperos9> @Darkvikingl59 ok thanks SeemsGood 

[15:17] <secretbossfight> They put balance items in RNG boxes, thata€™s whata€™s wrong with it

[16:25] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil i think this game runs a ton better on pc ps4 pro xbox one x 

[16:25] Abutter_my_bread> the Pro actually has better frame rate 

[16:26] <divanerasmus> Queen Eluzabeth has spoken 

[16:26] Abutter_my_bread> X is heavenly if u have a 4k tv tho since it's 2160-1800p 

[16:26] <vendatus> PC looks up a bit at times 

[16:26] <lvlpower> @DarksydePhil I'm playing on xbox one I can't even start a new match I have to booth out 
and start a new match 

[16:26] Abutter_my_bread> watch the DF vid if you're curious 

[16:27] <dinq_sas_sirence> xbox x is meh

[16:27] <darkone667> that aim 

[16:28] Abutter_my_bread> i like my Pro. got a good deal on. a new one with trade back in Jan 

[16:28] <dinq_sas_sirence> at least you have exclusives on ps4 
[16:28] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[16:28] <peterparkerthegod> wow the view from this thing is pretty sick 

[16:29] <neospartanhesperos9> honestly don’t like halo or gears that much, wouldn’t mind a PS instead 

[16:29] <chaosalltheway> POV penetration 

[16:29] <lvlpower> I didn't have no problems on the beta 

[16:30] Abutter_my_bread> im on the fence with buying a 4K tv and will probably just save up n get a real 

nice one in a year or two. 1080p is still fine until the next gen consoles come out especially in Pro since it's like 
half the resolution of the X and ill barely see a difference 

[16:31] <micgelo09> was hoping phil would play the osiris die for destiny 2 (explains more about thevex) 

[16:31] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> invest in 4k with next gen, not worth it with current gen

[17:12] <mksushi> :( 

[17:12] <dsphil> Broken game thanks Dice LUL 

[17:13] <blackrangerguy> dspShock dspYuck dspHmm dspSurpriseddsp dspAngrydsp 
[17:13] <gabriel_ko> when did he say that he will do the mini reviews of the games?

[17:13] <alexharveyconrad> Are there any fans playing with Phil right now? 

[17:13] <neospartanhesperos9> no 



[17:14] <markporterfield2> like my japanese animes, the empire always win 
[17:14] <myfellowjohnson> such a boring game... 

[17:15] <chaosalltheway> danTriggered 

[17:15] <dsphil> Basically a cluster of groups holding choke points and spamming grenades. 

[17:15] <cookiemonster414> gotta say phil has bad aim with the shotgun 
[17:15] <londorgael> graphics are really nice wow 

[17:16] <butter_my_bread> Nades cuz tremors in this game. Duly noted 

[17:16] <ml551ngn0> He shot you from behind. 

[17:16] <markporterfield2> graphics are amazing, but game is pure garbage 

[17:16] <londorgael> yeah lol you got shot from behidn 

[17:16] <butter_my_bread> im still on the fence about buying this hogwash 

[17:16] <chmf030> They actually make the side that win in the history easier. Hoth for the rebels, Kamino for 
the clones, Kashyyyk for the droids Takodana for the resistance and so on. @darksydephil 
[17:16] <smartweirdo95> games not garbage lol;l; 

[17:16] <kozatof> Wait @Butter_My_Bread 

[17:16] <butter_my_bread> kinda like multiplayer shooters 

[17:17] <alexharveyconrad> Stromtroppers that can actually shoot?! Well, imajun mai shock! 

[17:17] <butter_my_bread> i still have black ops 3 & Siege tho 

[17:17] <lastgunslingr> this game is crap, pure unadulterated crap 
[17:17] <londorgael> how is that random? 

[17:17] <myfellowjohnson> dsp being a bad loser is kinda getting annoying....just accept death bro 
[17:17] <dukaduka> gotta check your 6 LUL 
[17:17] <chaosalltheway> you need to move more 

[17:17] <butter_my_bread> Titanfall 2 i still haven’t played online markFeels 

[17:17] <ml551ngn0> Flanking is not random. 

[17:17] <dukaduka> @MyFellowJohnson you must be new here OpieOP 

[17:18] cbutter_my_bread> good thing it's round based i guess 

[17:18] <cookiemonster414> dat potato aim Kappa 
[17:18] <markporterfield2> flame on 

[17:19] <butter_my_bread> phil has abetter foothold on pellet mechanics than these devs 0_o 

[17:19] <londorgael> cause its progressive damage 
[17:19] <dsphil> Flame did zero damage LUL 

[17:19] <allanap> I wonder if Phil is going to tell us that it takes him 3 hours to make and eat pasta 
[17:19] <chaosalltheway> thanks for beta testing LUL 
[17:19] <goldencolts> Kappurkey TPDrumstick 
[17:19] <markporterfield2> that soldier is fireproof

[17:20] <butter_my_bread> markFeels 

[17:20] <alexharveyconrad> Boom!

[17:21] <londorgael> @DarksydePhil are you going to check out Ultra sun? 

[17:21] <chaosalltheway> danS 
[17:21] <chaosalltheway> save mittie 
[17:21] <markporterfield2> Execute Order 66 

[17:22] <butter_my_bread> tyrannical politics markRage 

[17:22] cbutter_my_bread> damn chat died :( 

[17:22] <butter_my_bread> TPDrumstick Jeturkey TPFork 

[17:22] cbutter_my_bread> shit.. 

[17:23] <goldencolts> DinnerTime 
[17:24] <dsphil> Chewy OP 



[17:24] <butter_my_bread> I wonder if Phil likes how there's a reload in BF2 

[17:25] <chmf030> @darksydephil for me Kamino is the best map. Both sides have good chances if they play it 
right. Takodana is so one sided that the first order cant win unless one team is full of fucking pro players and the 
other team consists of damn cones... 

[17:25] <londorgael> @DarksydePhil are you going to check out Ultra sun? 

[17:25] <markporterfield2> top 10 powerful anime characters 
[17:25] <blacktemplar2252> @londorgael I hope he doesn't 

[17:25] <neospartanhesperos9> none of General Grevious droid guards in this game huh, disappointed 

[17:25] <londorgael> @BlackTemplar2252 yeah just curious 

[17:25] <jalges> The rolls look so realistic lol 

[17:26] <optionalsuperboss> Grievous would be a cool hero too 

[17:26] <blacktemplar2252> @londorgael I hope he doesn't cause Pokemon is one of my fav games and he will 
just ruin it 

[17:26] <butter_my_bread> @neospartanhesperos9 the ones with the lightsabers? i know markFeels 

[17:26] <alexharveyconrad> Kamikazi droid? 

[17:26] <goldencolts> the alien planet looks so realistic you can tell they realy went there and studied it 
[17:26] <canvai> is it no 1st person shooter? 

[17:26] <blacktemplar2252> @londorgael Plus its Nintendo so there is no way he will play it 
[17:26] <butter_my_bread> grievous isn't in the game either 

[17:27] <blacktemplar2252> @canvai There is a setting that allows you to make it FPS 
[17:27] <markporterfield2> what?! a suicidal droid?! 

[17:27] <alexharveyconrad> Crazy, amirite? 

[17:27] <neospartanhesperos9> @Butter_My_Bread i thought they had a staff with electric prongs on either 

side
