[12:56] <terranines> CoD always had kids playing 

[12:56] <thatanonybear> COD is designed for kids, Activision has admitted it 

[12:56] <darkvikingl59> @DarksydePhil did you know this game got a 5 out of 10 from the users whats your

[12:56] <goldencolts> growing kids need their call of duty 

[12:56] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil Killstreak perks was the beginning of the end for CoD Multiplayer. 
[12:56] <kekon3> "Halo reach and TitanFall went crazy jetback nutzo, we have to do it too" 

[12:56] <thatanonybear> they didnt wanna do a WW1/2 CoD because they thought kids wouldnt buy it 
[12:56] <shlnn> B03 is one of the best selling cod 
[12:57] <davikombat> more like call of doodie 

[12:57] <terranines> WWII is already getting blasted by a few reviewers 

[12:57] <katexo234> remember the controversial airport scene in Modern Warfare 2

[14:30] <coca_ethylene> this isnt about a release without content, its about release with bugs 
[14:30] <darthradovanviking> I thought to sort this problems outt you had a thing called a beta 
[14:30] <thatanonybear> @GoldenColts LUL 
[14:30] <vitalidol> Hi 

[14:30] <stuart360> I love people making excuses for devs, like its 'wrong' to expect something to work that you 
paid good money for 

[14:30] <slayer_l l_king> @coca_ethylene you are right 

[14:30] <timboslicegb> coca name a gane thst dont have them with mp 

[14:30] <coca_ethylene> you dont have millions of people simultaneously playing in beta 

[14:30] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Ehm, well, that’s what you get with peer-to-peer lobbies and hitscan 

weapons... 

[14:30] <wiljil090> Or maybe you didn’t hit the hitbox....? 

[14:30] <huffysan> @DarthRadovanViking Was there beta for WWII? 

[14:30] <darthradovanviking> @coca_ethylene really? 

[14:30] <theycallmejimbob> hey vitalidol 

[14:30] <coca_ethylene> things are added post beta 

[14:30] <bootytease> @DarksydePhil its called a spawn trap

[14:31] <darthradovanviking> you can potentially have the whole playerbase pluss more playing in a beta. 

Because you make it free 

[14:31] <elzorrobot> I die, I spawn 

[14:31] <terranines> good point, if you keep moving you're harder to hit 

[14:31] <tuntsa> @thatanonybear comparing books and other items which are only in your use to video games is

[14:32] <bluejoeyl800> Are none of your friends playing phil? I think war mode is best palying with friends that

[14:32] <lord_edmund_blackadder> You even get points for "building" an MG next by holding down a button... 
[14:32] <bluejoeyl800> It did 

[14:32] <wiljil090> Wait so, if this is World War II why do the Krauts not have the actual damn Swastika?! The 
Iron Cross was primarily associated with Imperial Germany, not the fucking Nazis...

[14:35] <slayer_l l_king> Phil try using a different gun 
[14:35] <kovorus> games aren't book smart

[14:36] <cnkxx> @DarthRadovanViking And many games are still like that today, if you know where to look. In 
any case, one has to understand that games are now harder to make and much more complex

could fix the game 

[14:40] <bigheadl740> Wow, dude

[14:41] <jonathan_snow> @ThatAnonyBear what you think ? For new patron Goal Phil should do 10 push up's 
for every loss lol 

[14:41] <hindae> Just that servers are struggling, there's a polish to the game that says game is done, but servers 
arent. 

[14:41] <vendatus> call up Chance the Wrapper LUL

[16:58] <johngaltwho> @Always_REEEmember not the time or place for this convo but I don’t have any 



sympathy there :) 

[16:58] <vilky_p> @Eternia_Forever the matrix is a prison for your mind, it is a belief system, a religion. Why 
are talking about calculators? 

[16:58] <eternia_forever> sonic is removed the hedgehog is advancing cheer25 

[16:58] <gdayguy36> Every COD has connection issues right after launch 

[16:58] <darthradovanviking> well if people keep buying shit. I doubt they stop selling it :D 

[16:59] <butter_my_bread> you're never gonna get into the inner circle now phil Kappa 

[16:59] <phil_is_my_daddy> cheerlO Battlefield is running on EA dedicated servers, while CoD is peer to peer 
and always will be cause Activisions are greedy fucks 

[16:59] <johngaltwho> true @DarthRadovanViking that's what phil doesn't understand about lootboxes 
[16:59] <tomahawkings> So therea€™s a tank called hedgehog, right? Of is there an actual hedgehog roaming 
the battlefield? 

[16:59] <vilky_p> i wont buy it 

[16:59] <thatanonybear> "this hedgehog's advancing at SONIC speeds!" Kappa 
[16:59] <kovorus> cheer20 Rescue the hedgehog 

[16:59] <johngaltwho> buying a game that has lootboxes is enough to make it happen the next time they make a 
game 

[16:59] <theycallmejimbob> is this the run VoHiYo 
[16:59] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho absolutely 

[17:00] <always_reeemember> cheerlO The reason connections suck in call of duty is because they use "skill 
based matchmaking" that matches you with equal skilled players rather than local players with optimal 
connection/host #FactFriday 

[17:00] <thatanonybear> and i bought WWE 2K18 twice :(those lootboxes 
[17:00] <leewanner> @JohnGaltWho - Great name, dude. 

[17:00] <vendatus> well you can literally buy shit on the interweb LUL 
[17:00] <thiccbwoii> playing wrestling games LUL 

[17:00] <johngaltwho> yeah I'm pissed I spent ninety dollars on that game. I promised myself I wouldn’t do it 
again 

[17:00] <nightbot> Elemorphus Aphari just tipped $2.00

[17:00] <johngaltwho> @LeeWanner thanks :) 

[17:00] <butter_my_bread> Ur bad with money Bear TearGlove 

[17:00] <eternia_forever> because you have to understand what they are useing to imprison your mind to be able 
to free it @vilky_p 

[17:00] <danielswe> You shot him in the foot. 

[17:00] <leewanner> @JohnGaltWho - You a long time reader? 

[17:00] <darthradovanviking> transactions* 

[17:00] <sprank_n> actually you were shooting at the ground but ok 
[17:00] <johngaltwho> @DarthRadovanViking that's why I have a safe space 
[17:00] <weaponjay> Foot shots are deadly 

[17:01] <johngaltwho> @LeeWanner I actually read it after loving bioshock so much 

[17:01] <dutchvanderlinde> @butter_my_bread atpRtsd 

[17:01] <johngaltwho> so I could see the inspiration 
[17:01] <encelor> Footjobs are deadly Kreygasm 
[17:01] <vilky_p> @JohnGaltWho use self control 

[17:01] <leewanner> @JohnGaltWho - Haha, right on! My personal favorite is The Fountainhead. 

[17:01] <vendatus> Microaggresion hit him LUL 
[17:01] <weaponjay> You can get AIDS from footjobs

[17:01] <unrstone> Phil did nothing wrong 

[17:01] <encelor> i can get aides from footjobs sign me up Kappa 

[17:02] <darthradovanviking> if people want to buy things with micro transactions, that is only a good thing. It 
just a new marked.

[17:02] <vilky_p> @Eternia_Forever I do understand but not the other words and the calculator 
[17:02] <always_reeemember> @DarthRadovanViking microtransactions can be good if utilized correctly 
[17:02] <encelor> he din die 

[17:02] <butter_my_bread> it's ending with a tidal wave of salt dood markSalt markSalt markSalt 

[17:02] <how2cool> because you were using your secondary.

[17:03] <butter_my_bread> SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage 

[17:03] <johngaltwho> @DarthRadovanViking I am apathetic at this point about micros. They aren’t going 
away. Lootboxes we can stop before it's too late 

[17:03] <darthradovanviking> @Always_REEEmember if they are selling they are used correctly 
[17:03] <encelor> lootboxes been there for many years aka EA 
[17:03] <unrstone> :) 

[17:03] <tomahawkings> Youa€™re using a bb gun? 

[17:03] <butter_my_bread> on all accounts the connections have seemed fine =) 

[17:03] <weaponjay> Can’t be good at every game or win every time fuck it 
[17:03] <encelor> no way you can remove that deep rooted thing 

[17:03] <darthradovanviking> @JohnGaltWho yes it's called ignoring the games with them if you don't like it 
[17:04] <mintt> Plus the sun was in my eyes LUL 

[17:04] <always_reeemember> @DarthRadovanViking wut? i guess that's logic w/e 

[17:04] <vendatus> terrible yet I’ll keep playing so it must be good somewhat LUL 

[17:04] <unrstone> @tomahawkings I know, theya€™re fine hea€™s just not good at this game 

[17:04] <how2cool> because a low ROF low damage secondary is useless against a high ROF machine gun. 

[17:04] <theycallmejimbob> dspAngrydsp 

[17:04] <eternia_forever> lets all just calm down and have fun together it is launch day and this will get better, 
chin up young man cheer25 

[17:04] <johngaltwho> @DarthRadovanViking yes. by not buying the games, but people think that you can 

make them go away by buying those games and just not buying lootboxes. False 

[17:04] <always_reeemember> next time try securing an area before actioning an objective
