[12:25] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi doods 

[12:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> How was the ladt stream 

[12:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> Last

[12:26] <darksydephil> very nice, i like them 
[12:26] <deepdrive3254> nice one year crown :D 
[12:27] <kushiyakitori> KonCha You tried Kekon 
[12:27] <deepdrive3254> pops did a good job on the crowns 
[12:27] <aproxymate> Is Phil streaming today? 

[12:27] <beatlesl2335> ye 

[12:28] <darthradovanviking> yes he just tweeted 

[12:28] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hey phil. Will you play more of manhunt or call of cthulhu 
[12:28] <kushiyakitori> well it was a decent match Kekon. at least from the part i saw 
[12:28] <deepdrive3254> Are you feeling any better today phil? 

[12:28] <darthradovanviking> yeah i feel like a royal deep 



[12:28] <thenewfaceofcreation> Phil costume was decent 
[12:28] <aproxymate> [schedule 

[12:28] <nightbot> Nov. 2:1 return to streaming with Super Mario Odyssey at 12:30pm PDT! Then it's the 
premiere of COD WWII at 8:30pm PDT, 2 hours of fun multiplayer! 

[12:28] <darksydephil> well heres the deal 
[12:28] <thatanonybear> i love deals 

[12:29] <aproxymate> Why is he playing Mario? It's not earning him anything 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i dont have a typical sore throat this time, in fact im not really gunked up at all 
[12:29] <kekon3> is it something bad? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> my lefthand side of my throat is swollen, its the glands, meaning i have a viral infection 
[12:29] <thatanonybear> mumps? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i can feel the swollen lymph node on that side 
[12:29] <kushiyakitori> @Kekon3 what tournament? Tekken? 

[12:29] <kekon3> oh jesus christ 

[12:29] <aproxymate> Steam bath might help @darksydephil 
[12:29] <deepdrive3254> yikes thats not good 

[12:29] <thenewfaceofcreation> It seems going to a doctor is the best thing you could do 

[12:29] <darksydephil> so talking it doesn't even effect, its not like a raspy or irritated throat, ive had this before 
and its rare, its not the typical issue i get 
[12:30] <thenewfaceofcreation> Imo 

[12:30] <thatanonybear> swollen lymph nodes could either be very serious or a false alarm, hopefully youre 
okay :( 

[12:30] <darksydephil> okay, please send me $lk so i can go to the doctor tomorrow lol 
[12:30] <darksydephil> lymph nodes always swell during an infection 
[12:30] <nich2440> hope you feel better phil 

[12:30] <darksydephil> its actually if you have swollen nodes and no pain that you need to worry 
[12:31] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil where can i send it Kappa 
[12:31] <darksydephil> i.e. it could be something serious 
[12:31] <aproxymate> I think PCP are cheaper than urgent Care 

[12:31] <deepdrive3254> if you still have your yearly checkup i would think about going for that but i don’t 
know if it covers other stuff 

[12:31] <darksydephil> but since ive got obvious throat swelling and pain it makes sense 

[12:31] <darksydephil> i should be fine for streaming, since its not the actual raspyness o fthe throat or anything. 

i just have to take it easy and let the infection ride itself out 

[12:31] <thatanonybear> @Aproxymate depends on your area andd your coverage 

[12:32] <darksydephil> if it doesn't go away, then ill go to the doctor but ive had this before and it always does 
[12:32] <kekon3> well, irritating it sounds bad so I will say to force yourself to comment on everything 
[12:32] <aproxymate> Most insurances have a copay even for urgent Care 

[12:32] <darksydephil> not for the self employed aproxymate, we get the worst insurance in the nation 
[12:32] <bos2161> They don’t pay shit until you meet your delectable for the year though lol 
[12:32] <shega_ace> Try turning your microphone sensitivity up and not talk so loud today call it a quiet stream 
where we chill and relax or something 

[12:33] <beatlesl2335> Phil with that Roman Reigns illness lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> for me to do anything except the yearly checkup, its "coinsurance" meaning the 
insurance only pays a certain amount and ill still get hundreds if not thousands of dollars in bills 
[12:33] <darthradovanviking> fucking 3rd world republic who can't give their inhabitants healthcare. 

[12:33] <darksydephil> thats why in 2015 with my foot, i paid over $ lk 

[12:33] <darksydephil> i had an xray, blood test, and then the meds. nothing was covered 

[12:33] <aproxymate> @darksydephil you can check before hand how much going to a doctor will cost. They 

have cost of care calculator on their site 

[12:34] <aproxymate> X-RAYS are usually expensive 

[12:34] <darksydephil> btw there should be two changes today, we’ll see 



[12:34] <darksydephil> first change is, if someone tips me, it now says that in the stream chat along with their 
message 

[12:34] <darksydephil> it ties in with nightbot to do that 
[12:34] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I've never paid for an x ray 
[12:34] <nich2440> is the patreon muxy app working yet? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> second change is, if someone pledges to patreon its apparently supposed to tie in with 
muxy but 

[12:34] <thenewfaceofcreation> Is it about the patron popups? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> muxy doesn't even explain HOW. it might just be tracked but not displayed, i see no 
option to do a pop-up thank you for that 

[12:35] <thatanonybear> I had better insurance when I was homeless compared to when I had a full time job, 
because US 

[12:35] <deepdrive3254> oh thats a cool change 
[12:35] <nich2440> lets start the stream so we can test it! 

[12:35] <aproxymate> Is the pop up for all patron pledges or above certain amount? 

[12:35] <deepdrive3254> is that part of why its showing logviewer as a moderator now 
[12:35] <darksydephil> yeah theres no way to know until i try it out 
[12:35] <darksydephil> i definitely linked it 

[12:35] <darksydephil> in fact let me take a look right now be someone actually pledged this morning 
[12:36] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Never how much I take being Canadian for granted 
[12:36] <beatlesl2335> >Weedman country 
[12:36] <thelwhofarts> hi 

[12:36] <thenewfaceofcreation> Why doing the patreon pop ups now phil. Just asking 
[12:37] <aproxymate> @gettwobirdsstonedatonce I don't envy your property prices and your incomes 
[12:37] <darksydephil> yeah i literally see nothing about patreon in muxy. seems like its a good idea they haven’t 
implemented yet 

[12:37] <thenewfaceofcreation> Well. Hope phil is ok 

[12:37] <aproxymate> Also Canadian Winters DansGame 

[12:37] <vashyoyo> odyssy hypw this game is soo good hope phil finishes it 

[12:38] <sirjamesdtechl> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce Or your taxes in Canada to pay for the "free" healthcare. 
Or the constant de-listing of medical procedures. 

[12:38] <deepdrive3254> well single payer is typically more affordable 

[12:38] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Yeah I pay about 800$ a month for shit apartment and 25$ a month extra for 
my cat lol. Also I heated and unlighted lol 
[12:38] <kittyspank> oh oh 

[12:38] <deepdrive3254> but Canada has worse outcomes from deadly diseases due to wait times 
[12:38] <deepdrive3254> than the us 

[12:38] <beatlesl2335> yeah it sucks the illness put him off. i do NOT want phil rushing this game 
[12:38] <thelwhofarts> Hey Phil, love your content. I work in a hospital and i just wanted to say that since you 
have a history of gout, your probably going to need to get a blood test for uric acid. Problem is, you're a lil bich 
and u may have been doing too much dick suckin as of late, so it cud also be an STD. Kiss my ass! Love the 
streams, have fun gamin! 

[12:38] <nightbot> thelwhofarts -> I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! [warning] 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[12:39] <thelwhofarts> huh? 

[12:39] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Yep 

[12:39] <thelwhofarts> Can u not type out too long? 

[12:39] <kekon3> yup 

[12:39] <beatlesl2335> i see the prestream slides, ye 
[12:39] <deepdrive3254> yep 

[12:39] <superbatcat> Hello, People of Chat hope everyone is doing well. 

[12:39] <kushiyakitori> @thelwhofarts your message had a banned word I thi nk 



[12:39] <i_came_here_to_something> Phil you need to work out more and eat healthier. Unless it's some 

pre-existing condition you can probably do a lot more to prevent reoccurring sickness 

[12:39] <silentgeneral> Yeah 

[12:39] <thelwhofarts> I said @ s s maybe that 

[12:39] <kushiyakitori> lol nah, not that 

[12:39] <thenewfaceofcreation> @deepdrive3254 hi dood 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet out the stream 

[12:40] <deepdrive3254> it was probably since you said gout thelwhofarts that is a blacklisted word 
[12:40] <thenewfaceofcreation> @I_Came_Here_To_Something agree 

[12:40] <thelwhofarts> Phil u shud do ur DDP Yoga, for real. Itll be easy on your back. I mean you prolly 
already know this. Uve got the space now 

[12:40] <thelwhofarts> Ah yeah phil brought it up. Ill say "foot incident" 

[12:40] <thenewfaceofcreation> @deepdrive3254 stop ignoring your friend Kappa 
[12:40] <rbreezay> Phila€™s back? 

[12:40] <thelwhofarts> much like "masturbation incident" 

[12:40] <beatlesl2335> ya i hear ddp yoga is great 

[12:41] <rbreezay> Phila€™s foot? Huh 

[12:41] <aproxymate> Problem is he doesn't get any time 

[12:41] <thelwhofarts> Yeah I feel u gave up on ur back alittle too soon. Did they ever consider PT for u? 
[12:41] <thenewfaceofcreation> @Aproxymate time for what 
[12:41] <hardybuck4> v 

[12:41] <thelwhofarts> lol DDP yoga is 30min no warmup necessary, he can do it, dont patronize him 

[12:41] <aproxymate> Exercise and making meals 

[12:41] <boompoe> adumBooty 

[12:41] <thelwhofarts> hes not a fat bich 

[12:41] <cynothoglys_> sup 

[12:41] <thatanonybear> @thelwhofarts it's closer to 22 minutes 
[12:42] <thelwhofarts> Even better 

[12:42] <thenewfaceofcreation> @Aproxymate he has time to watch shows on netflix tho... 

[12:42] <stonerof95> Sound? 

[12:42] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Imagine if Phila€™s was actually in the style of Marioa€™s LUL 
[12:42] <thelwhofarts> He can watch the shows WHILE doing it tbh, it's not that tiresome or needing focus 
[12:42] <beatlesl2335> i think phil trying ddp yoga on a dsp tries it would be fun 

[12:42] <aproxymate> He has already explained his daily routine a number of times. He literally just games and 
do chores all day 

[12:42] <thelwhofarts> yeah DSP Tries it DDP Yoga 
[12:43] <deepdrive3254> whats up delta? :D 

[12:43] <i_came_here_to_something> @TheNewFaceofCreation If he took even 30 minutes every night from 
watching Netflix to exercise, a lot of his current health/emotional issues would be resolved over time. 

[12:43] <aproxymate> Netflix is during his time off from work 
[12:43] <cynothoglys_> phil does chores? Kappa 

[12:43] <thelwhofarts> @Aproxymate maybe he could not do laundry for a month and stop wearing underwear 
[12:43] <deepdrive3254> wait now its hosting kekon again 

[12:43] <blue_blur64> So guess who got out of work early and actually made it to a stream on time? Kappa 
[12:43] <thenewfaceofcreation> @I_Came_Here_To_Something ikr 
[12:43] <deepdrive3254> ok there we go thats better 

[12:43] <i_came_here_to_something> He could even work out while watching Netflix! 

[12:43] <hedggy008> Hi dsp 

[12:43] <shega_ace> Oh for goodness sake let him live his life i hate the internet always judging people why 
can’t we all just be here to support him, have a good time and get some enjoyment out of it 
[12:43] <deepdrive3254> aaaaaand beta mode is off again 
[12:43] <beatlesl2335> DDP's a saint.

[12:44] <beatlesl2335> Saved Y2j’s career with his yoga 

[12:44] <thelwhofarts> @Shega_Ace Well he complains about being fat, just trying to help the chubber 
[12:44] <rbreezay> Does phill have DDP yoga?

[12:44] <waifudestroyermatt> Dsp streaming boish 

[12:44] <cynothoglys_> hi phil 

[12:44] <thelwhofarts> Phil wud be a hotty with some weight loss 
[12:44] <coralguy> Thata€™s kosher phil 

[12:44] <darthradovanviking> just whipe your own ass and shut your mouth @thelwhofarts 
[12:44] <thelwhofarts> he cud be fucking biches left and right 
[12:44] <stonerof95> Ia€™m not hearing any sound 

[12:44] <blue_blur64> So I'm gonna play Mario as well while Phil's playing, I don’t want to fall behind xD 
[12:44] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Phil, would you ever consider styling your hair like Mario's? 

[12:44] <waifudestroyermatt> I thought its assassins creed today 

[12:44] <thelwhofarts> @DarthRadovanViking Ive Twitter DMed you. Don’t make me say anything. 

[12:45] <rbreezay> Phila€™s Netflix bingeing has been unhealthy lately. 

[12:45] <thatanonybear> @DarthRadovanViking LUL 
[12:45] <darthradovanviking> I just think you are trolling 

[12:45] <kushiyakitori> @WaifuDestroyerMatt schedule change cause he didn’t play anything yesterday 
[12:45] <shega_ace> Ok good cuz it just reads like they are judging, i read it wrong 
[12:45] <waifudestroyermatt> Oh right 

[12:45] <thelwhofarts> @DarthRadovanViking Christ yall are too sensitive. I gave sound, not judgemental 
advice 

[12:45] <blue_blur64> Since I did the next kingdom Phil's going to (and it's pretty small), I'm gonna try to get 

through what Phil did last time before he finishes 

[12:45] <deepdrive3254> well you're not wrong viking 

[12:45] <thelwhofarts> Someone else brought up ddp yoga 

[12:45] <epicun> I have been waiting for this 

[12:45] <rbreezay> Hopefully we wona€™t have anymore call in sicks in November. 

[12:46] <thatanonybear> does DSP have to actually call Twitch headquarters when he takes a sick day? 

[12:46] <thelwhofarts> And he seems depressed so exercise and healthy diet objectively helps with that. So sniff 
a fart man 

[12:46] <deepdrive3254> :D no anony 

[12:46] <thenewfaceofcreation> @ThatAnonyBear what do you think 

[12:46] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[12:46] <stonerof95> Is anyone else not hearing sound? 

[12:46] <nich2440> why would he have to call Twitch lol 

[12:46] <rbreezay> Calling in sick for the first day of the month is bad for patreon. 

[12:46] <i_came_here_to_something> @Shega_Ace No harm in giving some sound advice and suggestions 

[12:46] <thatanonybear> @stonerof95 hhe's on Switch, so n sound 

[12:47] <fluttershyl970> i seen some from call of duty ww2 it looks pretty good 

[12:47] <blue_blur64> @stonerof95 Switch doesn't make sounds unless you move 

[12:47] <rbreezay> @stonerof95 you have to wait 

[12:47] <corenayeetgod> oh boy another dsp stream whos doinked 

[12:47] <shega_ace> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Yeah i agree :) i'm sorry it just read like negativity but 
now i’m causing the negativity

[13:21] <i_came_here_to_something> That's definitely true 

[13:21] <atlastelamon9> Do a Patreon goal for buying new equipment. People will donate 

[13:21] <karthane> Paying you to play a game that literally everyone on Twitch has been playing for months isnt 

that inticing 

[13:21] <deepdrive3254> aaand second person reported for sending me dick pics 

[13:21] <elipsion> @DarksydePhil Can you add up patreon amount with tips / cheers for a cumulative goal 
[13:21] <amplitory2> does my twitch prime sub resub itself? or do i have to do it mannually, since its november 
now 

[13:21] <takisq> Why no Tier 2 and Tier 3 Sub emotes? @DarksydePhil 
[13:21] <deepdrive3254> cahman guys 
[13:21] <takisq> manually 

[13:21] <ronmexicooo> @darksydephil it would make it more enticing to do patreon if you changed the structure 




and instead of having a dollar goal just allow people to vote for stuff each month 

[13:22] <vendatus> deep get ready for a 3rd Kappa 

[13:22] <cynothoglys_> when are you going to play

[14:31] <darthradovanviking> It's a trap! 

[14:31] <blue_blur64> @Onlinecombosonly DS3 was because of Microsoft fucking up, and Fallout 4 was 
because of Machinima I believe 

[14:31] <bionich00t> DSP has got to be one of the top CoD streamers 
[14:31] <hardybuck4> Why didnt he get an advanced copy of COD? 

[14:31] <coca_ethylene> dsp needs to learn to play his cards right, he holds too many grudges to get special 
opportunities any more it seems 

[14:31] <takisq> It's still an advanced copy @blue_blur64 

[14:31] <fl5664> #TheRace is underway, lots of ppl have physical copies of COD

[14:52] <blue_blur64> @slowsynchro , it runs at 720p 60fps in handheld 

[14:52] <vashyoyo> Hop your jumps are quite poor 

[14:52] <mizorelover> This one took me a few times as well so keep at it. 

[14:52] <thatanonybear> @blue_blur64 is fps or resolution more important? 

[14:52] <blue_blur64> It's 60fps Phil 
[14:52] <solidussnakex> Fps 
[14:52] <splashfuzz> RareParrot 
[14:52] <takisq> fps > reso 

[14:52] <blue_blur64> fps is way more important than resolution, depending on the game 
[14:53] <terranines> fluidity over graphic fidelity 

[14:53] <kinggrub73> Fps is often higher when its handheld since the resolution is lower. Zelda consistently had 
less fps drops in handheld mode. 

[14:53] <terranines> for most games 
[14:53] <cynothoglys_> D: 

[14:53] <thatanonybear> this game, fps or reso? @blue_blur64 

[14:53] <blue_blur64> Oh, and the part Phil is trying to get to, I cheated to get there xD 
[14:53] <thatanonybear> i think fps 

[14:53] <mizorelover> I’ve played it on the screen a few times and it ran well. Can’t remember at what fps but I 

didn't have any problems with the small screen. cheerlO

[15:32] <sprank_n> okay 
[15:32] <ihav4gotn> Kappa// 

[15:33] <bammbino> anyone still think mario sunshine is better than this game? 

[15:33] <thatanonybear> @Bammbino i prefer it definitely 

[15:33] <xeranarth> This air thing is something I don’t think I'll ever get. Mario needs air in the 3D entries but is 
perfectly fine holding it for an eternity in 2D. 

[15:34] <ollyorange> wow amazing looks of this game 
[15:34] <vashyoyo> throw hat at cheap cheap lolol 
[15:34] <kekon3> you should probably cap something 
[15:34] <matitoooo> @darksydephil become the cheep cheep 

[15:34] <bammbino> @Xeranarth thats what happens when you try to make 40 games of 1 character universe 
[15:35] <xeranarth> True that, Bammbino.

[15:36] <blue_blur64> Caught you off guard, didn’t I fabs? Kappa 

[15:36] <roeygabay> Is this a childrena€™s game? 

[15:36] <bammbino> its a minor complaint but, i wish the composer made different versions of the song when 
you get a moon 

[15:37] <bammbino> this stage's music is nice and relaxing., you get a moon and a loud sound goes off 
[15:37] <blue_blur64> Yes, but you need to beat the boss here first before giving her the fish 
[15:37] <thatanonybear> @RoeyGabay in what sense? in terms of gameplay design, not quite 
[15:37] <thatanonybear> but in terms of aesthetic, absolutely 
[15:38] <flowingflapjacks> What's he trying to do? 

[15:38] <kekon3> alright, gonna take off rn, gonna go to class 
[15:38] <blue_blur64> I think he was trying to take off Dome's top hat 
[15:39] <darthradovanviking> I am almost going in to a coma with this music :D 
[15:39] <flowingflapjacks> But you can't... 

[15:39] <vashyoyo> shake the controller when youre a fish 
[15:39] <blue_blur64> You can attack as a fish 
[15:39] <vashyoyo> to do a attack 

[15:39] <flowingflapjacks> Shake the remote to do an attack as a fish 
[15:40] <ihav4gotn> unzip it Kreygasm 

[15:40] <thatanonybear> this is like a Katamari OST rough draft, before they tuned it into good music 
[15:41] <neospartanhesperos9> HOLY SHIT- he almost didn’t make it Kappa 
[15:41] <sprank_n> oh phil unzip me please Kappa

pit and find a new area, so phil thought that when he jumped into the fog 

[15:49] <coldkiller86> what how do you leave easy the way you came in 

[15:50] <jii_el> you just kill all the enemies 

[15:50] <jii_el> thats the point 

[15:50] <terranines> it's to kill the enemies... 

[15:50] <vashyoyo> leave lolol killing goombas 
[15:50] <xeranarth> The point was to kill them. 

[15:50] <blue_blur64> That's it, just kill the enemies with that 
[15:50] <popsicolo> Goomba genocide. 

[15:50] <bronaldbrumpf> So why is he doing it again?

playig 

[16:00] <thatanonybear> @Jii_El there’s nothing human or very emotive about the NPCs despite the elaborate 

environments and lively graphics 

[16:00] <thatanonybear> it’s very kafkaesque 

[16:00] <azathothcult> listening to mario’s footsteps makes me feel good for some reason 
[16:00] <jii_el> hmmmm

[16:06] <jii_el> Shaft you say? KappaHD 

[16:06] <couldntdoanything21ag> skeletoon costume=useless 

[16:06] <bammbino> phil only gets 100 or so per level., i cant imagine farming 10k coins 

[16:06] <coldkiller86> its somthing you can buy after the end game lots more to do after the last boss 

[16:07] <terranines> dude 

[16:07] <jii_el> does the game pad have motion controllers? 

[16:07] <turbopebble> Censorship, basically? 

[16:07] <jii_el> LMAO 
[16:07] <jii_el> motion controls* 

[16:07] <bammbino> there are motion controls 
[16:07] <jii_el> with the full size gamepad?? 

[16:07] <bammbino> no only for joycons 
[16:08] <jii_el> hm....can you move really fasts till? 

[16:08] <jii_el> still* 

[16:08] <bammbino> some reviews covered it 

[16:08] <jii_el> they say anything about having the speedboost of the motion controls? 

[16:08] <blue_blur64> No, there is motion controls with the gamepad too 
[16:08] <rbreezay> Why the low attendance? 

[16:09] <blue_blur64> This is normal attendance 

[16:09] <bammbino> not sure jil, i dont have this game or a switch., just that the reviewers mentioned them for 
joycons and that they arent really mandatory 

[16:09] <jii_el> i think it's because this game is pretty saturated by now 

[16:09] <jii_el> i have this game but i speedrun it with joycons 

[16:09] <darkvikingl59> plus a lot of people are waiting for his cod ww2 stream :p 

[16:09] <turbopebble> I screwed myself: puppy!0~0 

[16:09] <thatanonybear> @Jii_El you must have dexterous forearms 

[16:09] <jii_el> because of the speedboost i just was curious if there was a way i could move just as fast without 
throwing my arm out of the socket 

[16:10] <shega_ace> Opposite for me i’m here for Mario, couldn't care about Cod lol stopped at MW2 
[16:10] <jii_el> @ThatAnonyBear only for speedruns 

[16:10] <popsicolo> This place reminds me of the setting for the Sunken King die in Dark Souls II. 

[16:10] <bammbino> this enemy is so corny 
[16:10] <popsicolo> KUNG LAO 

[16:10] <jii_el> id get cod if i could play with all of my high school friends again

[16:12] <popsicolo> HE’S DEEEEEEAAAAAD WutFace 
[16:12] <rbreezay> That was flawless. 

[16:12] <neospartanhesperos9> this reminds me of the second stage from SuperMario 64 which is a lake stage as 
well 



[16:12] <jii_el> @ThatAnonyBear i guess but i’d be doing it at an abnormal rate...plus....my arms.... 

[16:12] <vashyoyo> next world is super short so i hope you go to it on todays stream :)

[16:12] <terranines> i always played Whomp's Fortress second and Dire Dire Docks third 
[16:13] <neospartanhesperos9> this game uses emotes apparently 

[16:13] <rbreezay> Last time I owned anything Nintendo was a Nintendo 64 my dad won at Fun Factory. In the 
90a€™s 

[16:13] <thatanonybear> tbh this game doesnt lend itself as much to dsp’s streaming as a south park or spyro 
[16:13] <turbopebble> Worried about those FunRun BloodTrail Two!

Phil ever tried fishing very much

[16:58] <timboslicegb> mario has never gotten peach lol she turns him down yyy8 

[16:58] <xxghostbritxx> my fellow stream viewers plz do not support nintendo be they demonitze all of phils 
vids 

[16:58] <bammbino> this music., so adventurous 
[16:59] <vashyoyo> no you have to use the worm foe that 

[16:59] <captaindcw9514> I never going to Ghost. BUt arent we with buying ther stuff?? 

[16:59] <bammbino> LuL 

[16:59] <blue_blur64> No Phil, the worm’s feet have to be on the platform to stretch to it 
[16:59] <curryslurperl2> god, this game looks so damn good, its tempting me to buy a switch 
[16:59] <vashyoyo> it works 

[16:59] <timboslicegb> once mario and peach get off screen she runs away from him Kappa 

[16:59] <chocolaterampage30> @curryslurperl2 i brought the switch for this, totally worth it 

[16:59] <mariol080p> gesundheit 

[16:59] <blue_blur64> nappyBless 

[17:00] <bammbino> BrainSlug 

[17:00] <thatanonybear> dspDeath 

[17:00] <chocolaterampage30> @curryslurperl2 and they are making metroid prime 4 for the switch 

[17:00] <timboslicegb> 200 bucks is when i buy switch 300 is alot rnmin 

[17:01] <thatanonybear> switch is a $99.99 console 

[17:01] <blue_blur64> 300 is perfectly fair for the switch 

[17:01] <blue_blur64> And really Bear? DansGame 

[17:01] <thatanonybear> thats just my opinion 

[17:01] <curryslurperl2> tbh, not really a fan of metroid or most other nintendo games. Zelda looks quite good 
too 

[17:01] <bammbino> so whats the point of the moons and why are they moons? 

[17:01] <timboslicegb> the controller sucks they should have bundled normal gamepad 
[17:02] <chocolaterampage30> @curryslurperl2 yeah zelda is amazing too. the world is huge 
[17:02] <thatanonybear> moons unlike level because they look like bananas 
[17:02] <thatanonybear> *unlock levels 
[17:02] <blue_blur64> Oh, cool Treasure Tracker reference 

[17:02] <timboslicegb> i would maybe play switch couple games a year so i need a price drop before i dive in 
[17:03] <blue_blur64> Well they said they're making a bunch of new IP's for next year 
[17:03] <thatanonybear> Yoshi game coming too 
[17:03] <curryslurperl2> are the moons like the stars in mario 64? 

[17:03] <blue_blur64> And Kirby 

[17:03] <chocolaterampage30> @blue_blur64 yeah 2018 will be another great year for nintendo by the sound of 
things

[17:05] <chocolaterampage30> later everyone 

[17:06] <speedydoll> so this is the place of the man 

[17:06] <darkmagicianl82> is it me or is it quiet 

[17:06] <speedydoll> the myth 

[17:06] <speedydoll> the legend 

[17:06] <blue_blur64> he just finished the stream dark 

[17:08] <speedydoll> so this is THE darksydephil right? 

[17:08] <speedydoll> the rage quitting legend? 

[17:09] <speedydoll> the one who quit persona at the final boss darksydephil? 

[17:09] <speedydoll> pay for me to ragequit a game darksydephil? 

[17:10] <speedydoll> the man who rage quit a lego game darksydephil? 

[17:12] <speedydoll> no seriously, is this darksydephil or is this a poser? i have only seen his youtube videos and 
i want to see if the horror stories are true 

[17:12] <speedydoll> im not a troll im just seeing if the videos are overblowing him or if they are accurate 
[17:13] <indigocardinal> both yes and no 

[17:13] <indigocardinal> he is unstable and toxic sometimes but usually decently mannered 

[17:13] <indigocardinal> on an average stream chances are nothing crazy will happen 

[17:13] <speedydoll> gotcha 

[17:13] <speedydoll> thanks
