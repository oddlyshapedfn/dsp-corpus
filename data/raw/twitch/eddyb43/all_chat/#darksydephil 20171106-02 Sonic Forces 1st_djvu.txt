[20:56] <popsicolo> PowerUpL popsicSmug PowerUpR Adobe illustrator power 
[20:56] <mcmad32> Phil are you excited? 

[20:56] <blue_blur64> It's also hard to trust reviews for sonic these days when they have such a sonic hate boner 
for the series 

[20:56] <bos2161> SabaPing 

[20:56] <samaell981> I heard Sonichu is in Sonic Forces. 

[20:56] <popsicolo> HAI YO FORCEEEESSS 
[20:56] <popsicolo> HAI YO FORCEEEESSS 
[20:56] <elzorrobot> I don't know half the cast of sonic Kappa 
[20:57] <kuwirufishu> Phil where is the sonic hat? 

[20:57] <intotheorion> sonic: shortage 

[20:57] <eldeadmariachi> Hey Phil I'm ready for "I am the fucking Knunckles". 

[20:57] <eternia_forever> oh its a 40 dollar release sigh i thought this was a triple a blockbuster release sigh 
[20:57] <convertedclone> reviewers have a hate boner for sonic... even though mania is a goty contender? 
[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> i think for the two year sub a dark crown with a purple flame coming out of it 
would look cool 

[20:57] <djrunol> 10$/hour? i get a better deal at a cinema and that means something 
[20:57] <convertedclone> sounds like the dc fanboy excuse 

[20:57] <i_came_here_to_something> @blue_blur64 I do hate the "Sonic was never good" assholes. 

[20:57] <yaylandsharks> wtf you hated mania lol 
[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> he liked he 

[20:57] <popsicolo> Well we have a year Neo and I'm thinking of cleaning up the crowns anyway. 



[20:57] <blue_blur64> Sonic Boom wasn’t made by Sonic Team 
[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> he liked sonic mania a lot 

[20:57] <howlingwolfjoey> @darksydephil i think the real reason SF was $40 because the game was spoiled 
before was released. 

[20:58] <neospartanhesperos9> why say he hated it 
[20:58] <eternia_forever> yup 

[20:58] <elzorrobot> Phil I don't know what this game is but I'm hoping it's funny Kappa 

[20:58] <solid_fantasy> Reviewers should go open-minded for everything, I do even for Fifty Shades movies lol 
[20:58] <blue_blur64> Yes, it is 60fps 

[20:58] <yaylandsharks> I watched him during titanic monarch lrnao 
[20:58] <fabsgnecco> sonic boom cartoon is pretty good 
[20:58] <nightbot> ratchefanl2 just tipped $3.00 

[20:58] <jordanstream> @DarksydePhil Are you gonna wear the Sonic hat? 

[20:58] <howlingwolfjoey> @darksydephil sonic forces i mean 

[20:58] <i_came_here_to_something> BUT modern Sonic games have been pretty up-and-down for the past 10 
years tbh 

[20:58] <djrunol> how do you spoil a fighting game? 

[20:58] <bunkbounce> its shit 

[20:58] <vashyoyo> heard this game was pretty bad lol 
[20:58] <kuwirufishu> @DarksydePhil bring out the sonic hat! 

[20:58] <eternia_forever> the tip 

[20:58] <neospartanhesperos9> ok popsi, it's up to you, i'm just brainstorming ;p 
[20:58] <blueglaria> Sonic forces could b a comeback for the series 

[20:59] <thelumniscientone> Without spoiling anything, some parts of this game are laughable. 

[20:59] <blue_blur64> Just check for the update once the game unlocks 

[20:59] <i_came_here_to_something> @BlueGlaria It already had its comeback w/ Mania 

[20:59] <eternia_forever> no sonic hat 

[20:59] <i_came_here_to_something> If anything, Forces might nullify that, but we’ll see 
[20:59] <eternia_forever> the countdown 
[20:59] <mcmad32> yayyy 

[20:59] <blueglaria> Sonic mania was a great game 
[20:59] <nich2440> soiled it 

[20:59] <annapanda_93> "I'd wear this hat if my hair wasn't wet">INSTANTLY PUTS ON A HEADSET 
[20:59] <firedrake82> then dry your hair off? 

[20:59] <elzorrobot> oh man that hat makes him looks autistic 
[20:59] <solid_fantasy> you blew it!!! 

[20:59] <eternia_forever> hurrrrrrrry 

[20:59] <fluttershyl970> sonic pr we riot Kappa 

[20:59] <convertedclone> people are being open-minded about forces to the point of delusion

[21:00] <lorddstar> the fake clerisy graces us 

[21:00] <kinggoken> da best stream on TWITCH 

[21:00] <intotheorion> sonic forces looks like ps2 gam 

[21:00] <thelumniscientone> @ConvertedClone I agree. I watched half a playthrough of some streaming Forces, 
and the game looks OK at best. Not horrible. Just OK! 

[21:00] <thelumniscientone> someone 
[21:00] <bigb_2718> Sup Phil 



[21:00] <lorddstar> just start 

[21:00] <eternia_forever> hit or miss 

[21:00] <blue_blur64> dafuq @Intotheorion ? DansGame 

[21:01] <blue_blur64> You'll see Phil 

[21:01] <eternia_forever> sega 

[21:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Sega owns Atlus, that's why 
[21:01] <popsicolo> Sonic Foreskins. 

[21:01] <eternia_forever> sonic mania was cheaper 

[21:01] <popsicolo> Pipsicolo and Papsicolo are my component forms that merge to form my current body. 
[21:01] <eternia_forever> pops cousin 

[21:01] <neospartanhesperos9> fast paced sonic to heighten that ADHD level for the kids 
[21:01] <chovi4> looks like poopy allready LUL 
[21:02] <vashyoyo> lolol 
[21:02] <mcmad32> oh jeez 

[21:02] <bos2161> pop getting ready to enter his final form PogChamp 

[21:02] <djrunol> how much you wanna bet he changed it accidentally 

[21:02] <convertedclone> there's probably barely a difference 

[21:02] <elzorrobot> you got a glitched version Phil 

[21:02] <yaylandsharks> it's not hard, normal is easy mode 

[21:02] <popsicolo> This game has a communist art style NotLikeThis 

[21:02] <djrunol> and now he is fucked 

[21:02] <howlingwolfjoey> oh no. BibleThump 

[21:02] <eternia_forever> dat pumped up music 

[21:02] <ratchefanl2> STUPID ASS HATERS GIVE THE DAMN GAME A CHANCE 

[21:02] <dukaduka> normal and hard LUL not even an easy 

[21:02] <solid_fantasy> Oh shoes 

[21:02] <neverjob> Dsp. Hard? LUL 

[21:02] <nich2440> how hard is sonic really though? 

[21:02] <neverjob> Zedd! 

[21:02] <eternia_forever> @ratchefanl2 you said it 
[21:02] <thelumniscientone> @ratchefanl2 No 
[21:02] <pinkdam> I thought that was robotnik? 

[21:02] <neverjob> Lord Zedd! 

[21:02] <chovi4> monkaS 

[21:02] <blue_blur64> Actually, the pricing is pretty clever. If you combine the pricing for this game and Mania, 
it's $60 

[21:02] <dukaduka> @neverjob it's sonic, not dark souls OpieOP he'll be fine 
[21:02] <neverjob> Phil its Zedd from Power rangers 

[21:02] <terroroftalos> I already played generations I don't need to play this inferior shit 
[21:03] <pablofortunata> remember when his name used to be Robotnik?

[21:22] <i_came_here_to_something> @dukaduka Actually no it's not. They made a new one. Altho Generations

[21:24] <i_came_here_to_something> @dukaduka If you mean in terms of level design, yeah, it's a lot like 
Generations, Colors etc. Tho it seems like the levels aren’t as inspired. But the engine itself is an updated one. 
[21:24] <elzorrobot> lol 

[21:24] <yaylandsharks> did you not see anything about this game lol

[21:39] <i_came_here_to_something> @BootyTease The Yakuza games do well, don't think those are rushed. 
They're making a new Virtual On too and that seems to be coming along well. Same w/ Sega World Driver’s 
Championship, but that one seems to be arcade-only.

[22:06] <deepdrive3254> if you go fast you gotta have quick reflexes 
[22:06] <neospartanhesperos9> jesus my eyes 
[22:06] <eternia_forever> ludacris speed 

[22:06] <bos2161> Whole game occurs in Sonics head while he's being tortured. His mind creates these worlds 

as an escape from the constant and grueling pain 

[22:06] <bos2161> Kappa 

[22:06] <kittyspank> hah 

[22:06] <fl5664> LUL 

[22:06] <eternia_forever> wtf 

[22:07] <i_came_here_to_something> @dukaduka I wouldn’t say let Sonic go completely; I think Whitehead's 
studio could give it a massively successful future if Sega actually backed their efforts seriously and give them the 
budget to do so. Mania is proof of that. But they really need to let Sonic Team do something fresh that isn't Sonic. 
[22:07] <djrunol> imagine this game being 30fps 
[22:07] <chovi4> wtf is happening 

[22:07] <thepunisherfrankcastle> Video compression the game. 

[22:07] <eternia_forever> omg 

[22:07] <weaponjay> cheerlO How are you liking the game Phil? 

[22:07] <ziibrah> lrnao this game 

[22:07] <spyder310x> is this a new sonic game >/ 

[22:07] <spyder310x> why do they still make these????????????? lol 

[22:07] <nightbot> Spyder310x -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning] 

[22:07] <neospartanhesperos9> you wouldn’t believe my face, i'm making the hardest concentration face with 
squinted eyes trying to focus on the fast stages and i cant catch everything 




[22:07] <kingtimmahb> I'm sorry, how did he manage to get an early copy? 

[22:07] <scruffshark> To me, that's a dumb executive decision to have only three designers take major role into 
making these games. If they had experience, then maybe. I think that decision is the reason we have levels that 
last about two minutes at a time. 

[22:07] <thepunchingcactus> I think you're supposed to manually aim 
[22:07] <danhedgehog91> Had it since Saturday, love this game

[22:08] <kekon3> visit my website, "Sonicdefinitelydied.dead" 

[22:08] <eternia_forever> lol 
[22:08] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[22:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @ScruffShark Agreed. Management of staff over at Sonic Team just 
seems disorganized. 

[22:08] <elzorrobot> man I think I suffered an epileptic shock 
[22:08] <blue_blur64> alright, have fun. I got work in the morning xD 
[22:09] <thatanonybear> @Kekon3 that's not a website BabyRage 
[22:09] <bos2161> don’t go to that site, it gave me ten viruses 
[22:09] <deepdrive3254> goodnight silentwarrior 
[22:09] <blue_blur64> Oh wait, boss fight 
[22:09] <kekon3> Kappa 
[22:09] <bos2161> Kappa 

[22:09] <i_came_here_to_something> They have people w/ real talent in there, but they aren’t getting a chance to 
do what they want 

[22:09] <thatanonybear> g’night blur tsosWave 
[22:09] <drybonezyt> Kappa 

[22:09] <dukaduka> @I_Came_Here_To_Something i think they need to step away from Sonic, give it a 

breather and maybe gain some speed from other ips. Then, they can move back into Sonic with some fresh ideas. 

[22:09] <blue_blur64> boss fight then I'm done 

[22:09] <deepdrive3254> :D 

[22:09] <lvlpower> @blue_blur64 bye 

[22:09] <kekon3> I don't want too draw that WutFace 

[22:09] <blue_blur64> @dukaduka This is the first game Sonic Team made since 2013 
[22:09] <chovi4> he is the new guy 

[22:09] <howlingwolfjoey> remember peeps. No Mario# this is Sonic! DX 
[22:10] <dukaduka> @blue_blur64 then what the f have they been doing? 

[22:10] <eternia_forever> Phil you should buy that hat and wear it on some of your streams lol cheer25 
[22:10] <thepunisherfrankcastle> Sonic Team thinks they're edgy not showing this guy's face. 

[22:10] <weaponjay> The outfits are terrible 

[22:10] <dukaduka> ITS NO USE SILVER 

[22:10] <monsterenvy> The Phantom Ruby form Mania 

[22:10] <neospartanhesperos9> they know how to make a game like Sonic mania, they clearly just choose not to 
for whatever reason that is 



[22:10] <solomusicl6> the phantom ruby from mania! 

[22:10] <weaponjay> 80a€™s Anime clothing 
[22:10] <mightyn7> why is silver even here NotLikeThis 

[22:10] <i_came_here_to_something> @dukaduka Yeah, a big problem is they've been trying to force ideas into 
Sonic that would probably work better in other IP. It’s not like Sega doesn't have the IP laying around they could 
bring back. Sonic Team themselves have Ristar, NiGHTS and Burning Rangers, probably others too I'm not 
aware of 

[22:10] <bos2161 > reeks of shit 
[22:10] <solid_fantasy> It's an Infinity Stone 
[22:10] <bos2161>LUL 
[22:10] <chovi4> edgy D:

[22:11] <fl5664> speak up, Infinite 

[22:11] <dukaduka> The production value of this game seems nice, but it just seems so weird 
[22:11] <monsterenvy> Infinite is a Jackal 

[22:11] <thevietnamesecomrade> @MightyN7 they all come from old Sonic games perhaps 

[22:11] <xxghostbritxx> he has soul stone phil lost

[22:12] <deepdrive3254> hey there deltaforce 

[22:12] <neospartanhesperos9> this boss fight is actually really cool 

[22:12] <thevietnamesecomrade> "I shall jump like a zig zag" - Sonic 

[22:12] <thenewfaceofcreation> "Deltaforce" 

[22:13] <dukaduka> @I_Came_Here_To_Something I just can’t understand how mario can go from 64 to 

sunshine, to galaxy, to odessey, but sonic can’t seem to find a 3D formula that works 

[22:13] <thenewfaceofcreation> Just say delta :p 

[22:13] <ttailsfox> this is actually pretty dope 

[22:13] <eternia_forever> hi the one in the middle 

[22:13] <deepdrive3254> if you prefer delta i will call you delta then 

[22:13] <eternia_forever> hit 

[22:13] <thenewfaceofcreation> Ok 

[22:13] <ziibrah> yeah actual cool fight 

[22:13] <thepunisherfrankcastle> He's literally Reality Stone. 

[22:13] <dukaduka> it looks really cool and it sounds really nice, but what the hell is going on? 

[22:13] <fl5664> that's one long serpent 

[22:13] <momochuu> this game actually seems pretty good for a 3D sonic game 

[22:13] <majinboo3> thats because the 3d sonic games focus so much on the speed aspect of sonic they forget 
that sonic is a platformer 



[22:14] <eternia_forever> @fl5664 that is what she said

[22:15] <caliber345> Echidna 
[22:15] <xxghostbritxx> unearned rank 
[22:15] <kekon3> too much edge 

[22:15] <i_came_here_to_something> @dukaduka There's times where it feels like they have, but they never 
stick with an idea long enough to iterate on it. EAD carry many ideas over from one game to the next and iterate 
them. They're also given a lot of time to polish their work. Sonic Team chucks out a good idea the moment the 
game offends a part of the fanbase, and Sega gives them strict completion times to finish the games. Even if they 
need more time, they just ship them out the door. 

[22:16] <thenewfaceofcreation> Too eady 
[22:16] <bos2161>ya 

[22:16] <xxghostbritxx> will phil ever play mvci again

[22:16] <reldio> This game any good? 

[22:16] <deepdrive3254> this game looks smooth so far 

[22:16] <thenewfaceofcreation> This game is edgy as shadow from his game 

[22:17] <nightbot> Afghanistan just tipped $100.00 

[22:17] <thatanonybear> @Bobbi_Ling boss fights ad character creator are good, but the regular levels are ehh

[22:42] <niruzi> Oh no. 

[22:42] <thenewfaceofcreation> This isnt the stage i thought it would be 
[22:42] <niruzi> this game is only 40$ 

[22:42] <niruzi> ? 

[22:42] <thevietnamesecomrade> I've no idea

[22:45] <mcbacon_eggin> LOL he is saving these ugly outfits 

[22:45] <thenewfaceofcreation> All i can see in the cowboy hat is mecreee 

[22:46] <neospartanhesperos9> mystic jungle PogChamp 

[22:46] <niruzi> so the story is switching back and forward? 

[22:46] <niruzi> da fuq 

[22:46] <ghostlyectoplasm> oh pinball levers ?? 

[22:46] <thatanonybear> story is switching from boring to mildly uninteresting 

[22:47] <mightyn7> tpYGOpotofgreed 

[22:47] <thenewfaceofcreation> Story is just eady 

[22:47] <neospartanhesperos9> all of the effort and engine of this game went into the Halloween animal dress up 
Kappa 

[22:47] <niruzi> I always wondered what those blak things were when you get all eggmans 
[22:47] <dukaduka> @ThatAnonyBear something between nostalgic, nonsensical, and actual original plot 
[22:48] <thatanonybear> @dukaduka i mean, the sonic comics have done great things with these characters, but 
we don't get to see it in these games 
[22:48] <niruzi> this music man.... 

[22:49] <niruzi> Not feeling it 

[22:49] <thatanonybear> this is really a hodgepodge plot 

[22:49] <dukaduka> @ThatAnonyBear it's hard to make sonic games 

[22:50] <dukaduka> i think the whole fast-paced style ruined the future of sonic games 

[22:50] <thefr0zenanus>. 

[22:50] <thefr0zenanus> sonic games were always fast-paced 




[22:50] <niruzi> I think he means the boost mechanic era 

[22:51] <darkwolfpuppy> Almost everything after adventure 2 was bad to meh 

[22:51] <thefrOzenanus> the first one was sort of slower and more platformer based tho 

[22:51] <niruzi> Like maybe since unleashed 

[22:51] <thefrOzenanus> rouge is my waifu 

[22:51] <bethefueg> Sadly the game got old real quick ): 

[22:51] <thefrOzenanus> there i said it 

[22:51] <momochuu> big ass for a rookie 

[22:51] <dukaduka> this looks really fun 

[22:51] <darkwolfpuppy> Unleashed' werehog lvls ruined it 

[22:51] <dukaduka> and it sounds cool 

[22:51] <alukartl77> DarkSydeWolf doing ask the king Keepo 

[22:52] <thenewfaceofcreation> Game too easy phil getting S 

[22:52] <thenewfaceofcreation> wau dood 

[22:52] <dukaduka> i just don’t know how to feel about this game 

[22:53] <mightyn7> :/ 

[22:53] <neospartanhesperos9> wow 

[22:53] <secretbossfight> FutureMan 

[22:53] <eternia_forever> yesssssssssss 

[22:53] <niruzi> music is persona-like 

[22:53] <eternia_forever> the gold s 

[22:53] <jakkutilde> This game hands out S like candy 

[22:53] <momochuu> this music is nothing like persona lol 

[22:53] <thenewfaceofcreation> Persona? 

[22:53] <elzorrobot> I miss the gaming days when boys were boys 
[22:53] <thenewfaceofcreation> Wut 
[22:54] <niruzi> not this music 

[22:54] <niruzi> that stage sounds like an older persona game 

[22:54] <eternia_forever> could u imagine phil wearing that gamer hat every stream lollllllllllll 

[22:54] <dukaduka> this game kinda just throws things at you, without really telling you why it's important 

[22:54] <niruzi> thiiiisss is weird 

[22:54] <dukaduka> KappaPride 

[22:54] <ghostlyectoplasm> wowzers 

[22:54] <neospartanhesperos9> AWWWWWWWWW RitzMitz 

[22:55] <reggiejay> KappaPride 

[22:55] <dukaduka> haHAA 

[22:55] <weaponjay> Lol 

[22:55] <darkwolfpuppy> FailFish 

[22:55] <scruffshark> That line hurt. 

[22:55] <dukaduka> i like the jokes in this game LUL the cheese is good 
[22:55] <eternia_forever> @dukaduka well you might be on to something 

[22:55] <thenewfaceofcreation> "Look at me guys. Im wearing a game hat. Means that im a 8 years leagcy 
gamer" 

[22:55] <i_came_here_to_something> Haha, Sonic you funny. Referencing the better modern Sonic game LUL 
[22:55] <scruffshark> Speedrun? 

[22:55] <alukartl77> And its hard difficulty LuL 

[22:55] <thenewfaceofcreation> Game too easy 

[22:55] <darkwolfpuppy> That line was cheesy, but in a good way 

[22:55] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil just stabbed me in the heart with that statement. Kappa 
[22:55] <dukaduka> It does look fun, but this is the first time a sonic game has felt "too fast" to me 
[22:55] <elzorrobot> I think you need to go back to dark souls phil 
[22:55] <momochuu> this is definitely one of the best 3D sonic games made recently 



[22:56] <scruffshark> The stages are under 2 minutes to beat some of the times. Speedruns would have to be 
under a minute, or even half of that. 

[22:56] <niruzi> about time 

[22:56] <thenewfaceofcreation> When phil getting the S rank. You know the game is super easy 
[22:56] <darkwolfpuppy> "No copyright law in the universe is gonna stop me" -sonic 2014 
[22:56] <thedoctor5437> game gives u too many outfits 5/10 Kappa 
[22:56] <thefrOzenanus> what does dsp think of sonic lost world? 

[22:56] <scruffshark> He never played it. 

[22:56] <momochuu> this one is a lot better than boom and lost world 

[22:56] <i_came_here_to_something> It's fun in the same way a Hollywood summer popcorn blockbuster is fun. 
Little if any substance, but a nice short thrill ride full of adrenaline. 

[22:56] <scruffshark> Anything is better than those two games. 

[22:56] <dukaduka> it feels the story is already reaching the midpoint, but it just started 
[22:57] <ghostlyectoplasm> og my god 

[22:57] <eternia_forever> now that is your grocery shopping outfit cheer25 

[22:57] <dukaduka> @thefrOzenanus i agree about the character customization going to waste 

[22:57] <ghostlyectoplasm> lmao 

[22:57] <i_came_here_to_something> LUL 

[22:57] <neospartanhesperos9> phil just putting random cloth items together lmfao 
[22:57] <temoblanks> Your character looks like a complete mess 
[22:57] <thatanonybear> dsp’s getting bit by the furry bug 

[22:57] <dukaduka> well phill thought road to hell retribution was good, so OpieOP eh 

[22:57] <thatanonybear> PUMPED 

[22:57] <dukaduka> sonic boom took itself too sesriously

8:30pm PST! 

[22:58] <kekon3> give your avatar a 360 spin dude 

[22:58] <scruffshark> Most of these levels feel heavilly scripted, so I guess I understand why it's fun for him. 
Not even saying this as just an insult. 

[22:58] <eternia_forever> it was good 
[22:58] <audiki> is it worth 40 bucks 

[22:58] <bethefueg> Every game is better than Boom. Thata€™s not an accomplishment lol 

[22:58] <eternia_forever> buuuuuuuut 

[22:58] <kittyspank> wtf u got goin on 

[22:58] <thatanonybear> @Audiki ehhh 

[22:58] <eternia_forever> sounds good 

[22:58] <dukaduka> @ScruffShark yeah it's a very on rail game 
[22:58] <jayjay2477> did he get xbox one x? 

[22:58] <thevietnamesecomrade> I gtg first, so see you @DarksydePhil and the friends! 

[22:58] <kittyspank> spankin the kitty 

[22:58] <friikshow> @BeTheFueg even Sonic '06? 

[22:58] <scruffshark> That's why I'm not gonna buy it. 

[22:58] <jakkutilde> you'll beat it next session easy 

[22:58] <dukaduka> it's easy to stream and play this game because of how it plays though :D so that's a positive 
[22:58] <elzorrobot> k gnight phil 
[22:59] <dukaduka> @Friikshow yes 

[22:59] <i_came_here_to_something> @Friikshow Man, Boom is easily more broken than '06 ever was. Play as 
Knuckles and you'll see the light. 

[22:59] <thevietnamesecomrade> I'm off first, cya guys! 

[22:59] <ratchet446> night 

[22:59] <scruffshark> These levels don't ask much from you. So I don't even know why I’d play it if I could 



watch someone's experience, and it'd be the same thing that'd happen to me. 

[22:59] <eternia_forever> take care everybody 

[22:59] <reggie_jay> @DarksydePhil what times do you stream 

[22:59] <kittyspank> bi phelas 

[22:59] <scruffshark> And it's at full price tag, yes?

[23:00] <darksydephil> ill just update that message in a few minutes for tomorrow's games bu tsame times 
[23:01] <scruffshark> If this game is short as I'm hearing it, then I don’t think it's worth picking up. 

[23:01] <darksydephil> thanks all for a great stream tonight! 

[23:01] <dukaduka> @ScruffShark it's $40 

[23:01] <thatanonybear> well, more often 7:30 then 8:30, that 8:30is usually new releases 
[23:01] <dukaduka> so not full price 

[23:01] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil thanks for the awesome stream phil 

[23:01] <scruffshark> That's fine, but I’d rather watch someone else play it if most of the levels are like this. 
[23:01] <scruffshark> It’s just not my cup of tea. 

[23:02] <thatanonybear> i loved it, it did improve my opinion of the game 
[23:02] <dukaduka> @ScruffShark that's fair 

[23:03] <dukaduka> the game looks 6/10 ish by conventional standards, but it's a pretty fun looking casual game 
[23:03] <dukaduka> i would buy it for my kid 

[23:03] <kittyspank> there are 16million millionaires in the usa if u cant afford 40$ to wipe your ass u dont 
matter
