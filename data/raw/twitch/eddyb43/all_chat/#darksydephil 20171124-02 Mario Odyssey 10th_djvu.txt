[19:47] <the_elusiveone45> cool 

[19:47] <curipd> What time does the stream start? 

[19:47] <nightbot> KFC just tipped $2.00 
[19:47] <thatanonybear> @curipd any minute now 
[19:47] <the_elusiveone45> lots of mass and weight 
[19:47] <litterial> anyone seen the moon levels? 

[19:48] <the_elusiveone45> @DarksydePhil Is today the last gameplay stream you'll do of Mario Odyssey? 
[19:48] <thatanonybear> @The_ElusiveOne45 that depends on if he beats it tonight, so probably not 
[19:48] <litterial> He's not beating it tonight 
[19:48] <chocolaterampage30> yoo phil 

[19:48] <gojirakunpls> @DarksydePhil Out of pure curiosity, will you do the new pokemon games..? 

[19:48] <danznewz> I get that same way. 




[19:49] <the_elusiveone45> Isn’t Darker Side super hard? 

[19:49] <litterial> @The_ElusiveOne45 yes 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> @The_ElusiveOne45 by all accounts, yea 
[19:49] <markrodriguez09> sup DSP 
[19:49] <markrodriguez09> grow a ponytail 

[19:50] <litterial> I haven't played the game, but I think the difficulty is pretty on par with the last level of Super 
Mario Galaxy 2 

[19:50] <bentboxer> my hair is down to my shoulders 
[19:50] <bentboxer> i havent cut my hair in at least 6 months 
[19:50] <the_elusiveone45> 2+2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3 quick maths 
[19:51] <markie_mark_> when's marvel? 

[19:51] <tourwithme> it would take longer than 6 months for your hair to be at your shoulders 
[19:51] <the_elusiveone45> Is it harder than Grandmaster Galaxy in SMG2? 

[19:51] <thatanonybear> @The_ElusiveOne45 you mixed up the 3 and 1 
[19:51] <thatanonybear> minus 3, that's 1, quick maths 

[19:51] <beatlesl2335> just so you know phil, if you return to new donk city that theater you were looking for 

opens with a pretty cool thing inside =p 

[19:51] <kusomoto> Which city are you all living in? 

[19:51] <thatanonybear> @kusomoto cmonBruh 

[19:51] <the_elusiveone45> @ThatAnonyBear It's from a song 

[19:52] <thatanonybear> everyone what's your postal code :) 

[19:52] <thatanonybear> @The_ElusiveOne45 yeah, Man's Not Hot 

[19:52] <litterial> @The_ElusiveOne45 The stage is looks longer than the GrandMaster Galaxy 
[19:52] <reliccastle> you do realize your intro ads are still running? 

[19:52] <kusomoto> i think i have a different timeline 
[19:52] <bentboxer> long hair dont care 

[19:52] <bentboxer> warriors are so boring with kevin durant to watch 

[19:53] <the_elusiveone45> @DarksydePhil That Stereo you ran into in the Mushroom Kingdom was playing 
the Japanese version of "Jump Up, Super Star". Not simlish lol 

[19:53] <litterial> @The_ElusiveOne45 but I’d say the GrandMaster Galaxy is harder because you have to beat it 
with one bar of hp. 

[19:53] <kusomoto> speaking of kevin durant, phil should check out nba 2kl8 my career 
[19:53] <kusomoto> face scan is a lot more improved 
[19:53] <bentboxer> it sucks 

[19:53] <the_elusiveone45> You should do fan appreciation of Cod WW2 and BF2 at some point 

[19:53] <bentboxer> 2kl8 

[19:53] <bentboxer> dont get it 

[19:53] <bentboxer> my career mode sucks 

[19:53] <bentboxer> graphics suck 

[19:54] <the_elusiveone45> @Litterial Yeah. That Galaxy kicked my ass lol 
[19:54] <thatanonybear> @DarksydePhil reset top cheer? :P 
[19:55] <jovayowolu> its reset 

[19:55] <thatanonybear> my screen might be bugged :o 
[19:55] <thatanonybear> bugs everywhere man 

[19:55] <litterial> @The_ElusiveOne45 Like the Perfect Run in the GrandMaster Galaxy, if you fall off the stage 
or lose all you health, you have to restart the stage. 

[19:55] <litterial> @The_ElusiveOne45 at least you can get hearts on the darker side. 

[19:55] <kusomoto> i don't have a credit card yet so i won’t cheer lol 
[19:56] <jovayowolu> what headphones did he get? 

[19:56] <curipd> Is Mario odyssey worth getting for the switch? 

[19:56] <the_elusiveone45> @kusomoto You can get bits by watching ads. It's not much, but at least you get

[20:19] <the_elusiveone45> Sunshine is underrated 

[20:19] <dsphil> Rip Mario... 

[20:19] <elite878> Lol 

[20:19] <hitecspecs> Lmao 

[20:19] <frankenfunk> sunshine is overrated 

[20:19] <the_elusiveone45> Nah, Sunshine gets so much hate these days 



[20:20] <neospartanhesperos9> super mario 3 was the hardest mario game i ever played 

[20:20] <hitecspecs> Sunshine was not liked during its day. I remember I never finished it because I didn’t like it. 
[20:20] <extracheeez> sunshine was released too early and unpolished. But it was still great. 

[20:20] <dsphil> Super Mario world > Mario 64 

[20:21] <the_elusiveone45> It’s a good game and doesn't some really interesting things gameplay wise. But still 
really good. 

[20:21] <frankenfunk> lost levels is a lot harder than mario 3 

[20:21] <the_elusiveone45> Sadly, there's no reason to get all the shine sprites 

[20:21] <frankenfunk> but still an awesome game 

[20:21] <allisterkendross> Mario is Missing > Every other Mario 

[20:21] <the_elusiveone45> I never beat Lost Levels. Too difficult 

[20:21] <extracheeez> ditto, fuck the lost levels in their collective asses 

[20:21] <dsphil> Dsp>ReviewTechUsa 

[20:21] <bentboxer> we're the kids in america rip off song 

[20:21] <frankenfunk> i’ve beaten it., took me about 7 hours the first time i beat it 

[20:22] <hitecspecs> I like the DS version of Mario 64. Miyamoto originally wanted to include different 

characters. The version is his original vision. 

[20:22] <thatanonybear> @bentboxer i dont hear it 
[20:22] <dsphil> LINISH HIMMM.... 

[20:22] <neospartanhesperos9> Nice job finishing the last boss again LUL

inside jokes and memories. 

[20:27] <neospartanhesperos9> That’s not Peppy RlyTho

[20:31] <neospartanhesperos9> well imo 

[20:31] <rocket_man_ss> I can give you a tip on a boost up heart that you can get...if interested. 

[20:31] <niionkai> Hm... I live in an area that's considered rather "hillbilly", but that clothing and style is rather 
outdated.
