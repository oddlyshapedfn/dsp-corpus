[20:05] <ornightz> But Twitch Pays LUL 

[20:05] <neospartanhesperos9> People who use dating or relationship finder apps to find a match don’t know 
anything about relationships TPFufun 
[20:05] <kittyspank> im scared 

[20:06] <markrodriguez09> ppl only use tinder to fuck, not relationships 

[20:06] <nightbot> Need For Speed Game Devs just tipped $3.00 

[20:06] <thatanonybear> tinder/grindr is for hookups, not lassting relationships LUL 

[20:06] <markrodriguez09> let's be honest here 

[20:06] <thatanonybear> especially grindr 

[20:06] <neospartanhesperos9> I don't use Tinder so i wouldn't know what it's use is 
[20:06] <suckasurprise> Shoutouts to the anonymous fan who purchased the switch for Phil last spring, the 
Street Fighter 2 gameplay and Mario Odyssey have made it totally worth it 
[20:06] <superbatcat> nice color blue 

[20:06] <markrodriguez09> i’d never use those ghetto apps if i wanted something true 
[20:06] <succkonlemon> dspShock

[20:06] <popsicolo> THICC MODS? popsicSmug 

[20:06] <markrodriguez09> it's for 'dating' but everyone uses it for hook ups 

[20:06] <ass_blastor> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Tinder to just find girls/guys to fuck depending on your 

preference, not for relationships

[20:56] <i_came_here_to_something> @majinboo3 You dumb? Miyamoto didn’t direct Odyssey; Tezuka did. 
Tezuka's been directing them since the Galaxy games on Wii. 

[20:56] <the_elusiveone45> If you beat this, then it's like you've beaten the game for real. 

[20:56] <vashyoyo> mario 3d worlds last final evel is harder 
[20:56] <kozatof> @extracheeez yeah no wonder he doesna€™t have wr 
[20:56] <the_elusiveone45> Yes there’s the 100% bonus, but not spoiling that lmao 
[20:56] <kozatof> People like vallu beat him 

[20:57] <howlingwolfjoey> *slaps @Vashyoyo with a large trout* >:T 

[20:57] <poopshortsjr> Imagine you're Mario and you have to beat this stage to save Leanna, Phil. 

[20:57] <the_elusiveone45> @yolodopper It’s too weed out the casuals lol. Why don't you people understand 
this? 

[20:57] <majinboo3> LOL 
[20:57] <darkslayergod> HAHAHA 
[20:57] <obeychuy89> lmao 
[20:57] <jv5_guy> obviously not 

[20:57] <justjoined83> Stages like this can be frustrating but repetitive motion helps you master the controls. 

[20:57] <princegl03> Phil I am happy for you glad you able to move on 

[20:57] <soliddave> the last 3 games had this type of final stage 

[20:57] <majinboo3> This is just tradidional japanese game trolling 

[20:57] <jv5_guy> it was a stage to catch us off guard 

[20:57] <darthradovanviking> this is classic phil righthere 

[20:57] <howlingwolfjoey> *slaps @poopshortsjr with a trout* >:T 

[20:57] <majinboo3> Nintendo has been doing this shit since punch out 

[20:58] <majinboo3> they know how to make bullshit 

[20:58] <litterial> Guys, do you think Phil is beating this stage tonight 

[20:58] <infinite_55> Lol, a dark souls emulator...youa€™ve got to be kidding me 

[20:58] <beatlesl2335> Its opyionsl 

[20:58] <yolodopper> cheer 10 i think they are trying to target that hardcore dark soul demographic to their games 
[20:58] <jv5_guy> none of us expected it so it was unique 

[20:58] <neospartanhesperos9> It’s not a dark souls stage, it's just a ruined castle with cloudy skies, dude 
ResidentSleeper 

[20:58] <i_came_here_to_something> @majinboo3 You have to be a moron 

[20:58] <extracheeez> you haven't seen bullshit till you've seen some of the sunshine bonus levels oh man 
[20:58] <calqlusl01> Best level ever! :D 

[20:58] <vashyoyo> mario 3d world had the hardest stage phil lmao this is just salt 
[20:58] <nightbot> Fluffy shits just tipped $2.00 



[20:58] <jv5_guy> drop down to the spot like before???? 

[20:58] <howlingwolfjoey> @Vashyoyo im gonna keep slapping you you know? 

[20:58] <extracheeez> yeah vash champions road tops em all :/ 

[20:59] <majinboo3> Phil has compleded every dark souls game multiple times and even he is finding this level 
BS 

[20:59] <jv5_guy> complaining is waisting your time 
[20:59] <majinboo3> i think this proves something 
[20:59] <vashyoyo> lool for telling the truth ? go ahead 

[20:59] <i_came_here_to_something> Man how were you able to play Ninja Gaiden back in the day but can’t 
manage this. It's easy by comparison to that game. 

[20:59] <obeychuy89> lrnao 
[20:59] <darkslayergod> LOL 

[20:59] <vashyoyo> nah this just proves he has no time he wants to get done with video games 
[20:59] <majinboo3> He didnt he ragequit ninja gaiden when he played it on youtube 
[20:59] <voodookillz> XD 

[20:59] <howlingwolfjoey> @Vashyoyo no, for ,mentioning "mario" 

[20:59] <cte900> lol 

[20:59] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[20:59] <calqlusl01> F 

[20:59] <beatlesl2335> You're over reacting phil 
[20:59] <jv5_guy> change the camera angle 
[20:59] <chocolaterampage30> loool 
[20:59] <majinboo3> BORED 
[20:59] <soliddave> go explore the other levels then 
[20:59] <kozatof> Hah 
[20:59] <hns_croatian> lmao 
[20:59] <beatlesl2335> Its optional 

[20:59] <the_elusiveone45> Isn’t there a secret path for this? 

[20:59] <eldeadmariachi> lol Yeah phil wouldn’t even beat the first level on master Ninja 
[21:00] <the_elusiveone45> lol 
[21:00] <infinite_55> :D 

[21:00] <litterial> So Champion's Road is harder than The Perfect Run from Galaxy 2? 

[21:00] <veramer> why dont they make more dark souls games intstead of puting it into kids games 
[21:00] <kushiyakitori> why not do that then 
[21:00] <darthradovanviking> hahahaha 
[21:00] <obeychuy89> poorly made 

[21:00] <jv5_guy> ok @ phil do that then come back to this 
[21:00] <extracheeez> there is a frog skip for the whole level yes 
[21:00] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Anything for the dollars 
[21:00] <majinboo3> SHIT game design 
[21:00] <poopshortsjr> Relax Phil. You're rushing it. 

[21:00] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil, you'll do it so many... Damn... Times... Doing the same stage... That you'll 

have a fantastic perfect run at the end CoolStoryBob 

[21:00] <the_elusiveone45> "Badly designed" lmao salt is real 

[21:00] <eldeadmariachi> Nintendo finally add some challenge to Mario and now is shit, i don't get it 
[21:00] <suzakurebellion> hey phil, there a glitch you can do with the frogs an the frog can swim in the air so i 
skipped the entire level, the way to make this glitch work, you become the frog an jump an then land on the other 
frog while it jumps an get out an become the other frog an you'll be glitched in the air so you can make it without 
doing this whole level. 

[21:00] <calqlusl01> Phil could at least do Glydon skip 

[21:00] <extracheeez> yeah you can but it's super super cheese StinkyCheese and a bug 

[21:00] <howlingwolfjoey> i bet phil is not gonna get this game an outrageous 10/10(thank god) 



[21:01] <i_came_here_to_something> @elDeadMariachi You're not supposed to get it. Only Phil's supposed to 
get it. It's Phil logic. 

[21:01] <vashyoyo> people complained this game was easy Kappa 
[21:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Oh boy, cheat time 
[21:01] <jv5_guy> take notes then 

[21:01] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Isna€™t this on easy mode? 

[21:01] <the_elusiveone45> You can skip an entire section when flying by shaking the controller repeatedly 
[21:01] <neospartanhesperos9> copy paste that shit LUL 
[21:01] <deepdrive3254> its not an easy glitch to pull off 

[21:01] <eldeadmariachi> @i_came_here_to_something Yeah Phil doesn't understand 
[21:01] <infinite_55> Wow 

[21:01] <i_came_here_to_something> This is gonna be like the bridge thing from Crash 2 all over again 
[21:01] <kozatof> You do that glitch Ia€™ll be disappointed philbert 
[21:01] <jv5_guy> do it no shame 

[21:01] <extracheeez> the frog glitch is kinda hard I honestly couldn’t do it 
[21:02] <majinboo3> Lets see if he can glitch this shit 

[21:02] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil's worse enemy, a glitch, will be his best friend in the end LUL 

[21:02] < jv5_guy> i used the stair glitch in sm64 no shame 

[21:02] <kozatof> @extracheeez man now hea€™s just gonna cheese it 

[21:03] <justjoined83> Dona€™t forget th heart 

[21:03] <voodookillz> XD 

[21:03] <jv5_guy> nintendos fault for leaving glitches in the game 

[21:03] <beatlesl2335> Phil, this isnt fair. One OPTIONAL experiance shouldnt ruin the game for you 
[21:03] <neospartanhesperos9> OSfirog 
[21:03] <jv5_guy> inb4 patches 

[21:03] <suzakurebellion> it takes afew takes to do this glitch but trust me, you'll be glad you do this, instead of 
wasting time. 

[21:03] <i_came_here_to_something> Miyamoto didn’t design this level 

[21:03] <infinite_55> Lol, thata€™s what you get for rushing and cheezing the game 

[21:03] <majinboo3> Miyamoto can suck my DICK 

[21:03] <jv5_guy> lul 

[21:03] <sanvilla93> did he just rage quit? 

[21:04] <poopshortsjr> Miyamoto doesn't design levels anymore. 

[21:04] <eldeadmariachi> if a game is fun then is not challenging. If the game is challenging then is not fun the 
reward is perseverance and prove your skills 
[21:04] <jv5_guy> youtbe exists lul 
[21:04] <vashyoyo> miyamoto disappointed 

[21:04] <extracheeez> you should check out a quick youtube video of this first 

[21:04] <i_came_here_to_something> @suzakurebellion It's a waste of time to play the game legit on your 
initial playthrough? Shouldn’t a frog glitch be used for speedrunning after you've actually beaten it the first time 
legit? 

[21:04] <neospartanhesperos9> Someone who knows, fucking repeat the glitch message again 

[21:04] <kozatof> Unreal 

[21:04] <admiralprawn> They fixed the glitch. 

[21:04] <majinboo3> its very precise timing 

[21:04] <yolodopper> cheer 10 hey phil have you ever used ebay? i just got scammed by someone because they 
returned me an empty box, dont sell your statues on ebay! 

[21:04] <calqlusl01> Rage coming again shortly... 

[21:04] <kushiyakitori> lol 

[21:04] <caper_three> you gotta change back 

[21:04] <infinite_55> They patched it 

[21:04] <caper_three> when in the air 



[21:04] <extracheeez> they didn’t patch it 
[21:04] <poopshortsjr> They patched it. 

[21:04] <darthradovanviking> the lyrics tell about the glitch? 

[21:04] <kozatof> @extracheeez you ruin the fun 

[21:04] <calqlusl01> It is not patched 

[21:04] <suzakurebellion> it takes afew takes to do it. 

[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> @yolodopper you fucked up, lmfao, lets laugh at you LUL 

[21:05] <kozatof> Feelsbadman 

[21:05] <infinite_55> Yeah they patched it! 

[21:05] <extracheeez> meh I was never good at lying :/ 

[21:05] <majinboo3> it is not patched you trolls 
[21:05] <obeychuy89> lmao 

[21:05] <darkslayergod> He will spend more time on this glitch than trying to do the actual level 

[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> rip wtf you dummya 

[21:05] <caper_three> it still works kappa 

[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> DUMMYS IN CHAT YO 

[21:05] <pinkdam> I thought they did patch it? 

[21:05] <caper_three> check youtube vid 

[21:05] <jv5_guy> @ phil dont listen to them its not patched 

[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 

[21:05] <poopshortsjr> You're trolling by saying it's patched. 

[21:05] <admiralprawn> I never said they patched it, I said they uh, they 'fixed the glitch’. 

[21:05] <caper_three> not doing it right 

[21:05] <msdbzbabe> You'll know when the glitch works if the frog is swimming in air, when that happens don't 
jump, just go straight to the building 

[21:05] <majinboo3> just look up a video like you did for spyro then you will understand 
[21:05] <kozatof> You people actually want phil to glitch this ? 

[21:05] <poopshortsjr> I mean by saying it's not patched. 

[21:05] <eldeadmariachi> Boy you can clearly see Phil is pissed 
[21:05] <kozatof> Laughable 

[21:05] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Ita€™s patch play fair and git gud 

[21:05] <voodookillz> yeah only to see if he can do it 

[21:05] <kozatof> People actually want phil to glitch instead of beating it 

[21:05] <voodookillz> XD 

[21:05] <jv5_guy> look it up 

[21:05] <i_came_here_to_something> So this is modern gaming: You don't have the skill to play it honestly? 
Just find a cheat and exploit the fuck out of it. SMH. 

[21:06] <killlmyself> @kozatof whats the point if he has no fun on the final stage 

[21:06] <gutty333> hello 

[21:06] <kozatof> Hmmmm 

[21:06] <vashyoyo> casual gamers man 

[21:06] <majinboo3> Yes you switch once then switch back 

[21:06] <caper_three> jump high, de morph, and land on the other frog as it jump and morph into it 
[21:06] <kozatof> Let me wonder 

[21:06] <kozatof> People actually want phil to glitch instead of beating it 
[21:06] <jv5_guy> i mean yeah if exploits exist abuse them 
[21:06] <paddingtonbearl87> shieeeeet 

[21:06] <the_elusiveone45> Just the take the L Phil, and move on. 

[21:06] <poopshortsjr> Finding cheats has always been part of gaming. 

[21:06] <soliddave> you have to jump with the first frog then capture the 2nd frog as its jumping 
[21:06] <infinite_55> Ita€™s patched, those whoa€™s saying ita€™s not are trolling!! 

[21:06] * neospartanhesperos9 one hour later, still getting the glitch LUL 



[21:06] <vashyoyo> yeah take the L 

[21:06] <veramer> whats this trash ass music 

[21:06] <admiralprawn> If only you could glitch your way through Dark Souls. 

[21:06] <msdbzbabe> You got to let the other frog jump first 

[21:06] <eldeadmariachi> @i_came_here_to_something This is what I hate about modern gaming and gamers. 

apparently everything should be easy 

[21:06] <darkslayergod> Only casual cod fans think that 

[21:06] <msdbzbabe> I believe 

[21:06] <kozatof> So leta€™s watch phil try to do some dumb glitch just for him to gloat 

[21:06] <ass_blastor> cheerlO At the peak of your jump, get out of the frog and try to capture the other frog 

while its jumping 

[21:06] <poopshortsjr> Christmas music. 

[21:06] <mujtabal2321> jump on the frog 3 times in a row while its in the air and shake your controller 
[21:07] <majinboo3> i have the link for the video but i cant post link 
[21:07] <dolanpls01995> um what is he trying to do? 

[21:07] <justjoined83> This is harder than the actual level 

[21:07] <vashyoyo> take the L and lets go to other world or just end the game LoL 

[21:07] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Mario like PokA©mon is for kids. You a grown man, cana€™t beat it lol 

[21:07] <extracheeez> cheer50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuCvYyFJ67Y&t=37s 

[21:07] <nightbot> Extracheeez -> Please don’t post links, [warning] 

[21:07] <infinite_55> You could have beat the game already 
[21:07] <jv5_guy> so basically capture , mario, capture again 

[21:07] <kozatof> People actually want phil to glitch instead of beating it People actually want phil to glitch 
instead of beating it 

[21:07] <extracheeez> hopefully the link made it through the cheer :) 

[21:07] <neospartanhesperos9> AT THE PAK 

[21:07] <majinboo3> ???? that wasnt the high of his jump 

[21:07] <neospartanhesperos9> PEAK 

[21:07] <i_came_here_to_something> @elDeadMariachi It's why most reviewers suck, and why gamers say 
anything beyond their skill level is "bad game design". Now they want to push this bullshit "QoL" mechanics on 
developers to make games more "accessible". If a game's too hard for someone, they should just find an easier 
game to play. 

[21:07] <admiralprawn> Jump up don't be scared. 

[21:07] <drloverocket> lame 

[21:07] <killlmyself> @kozatof you already said that. 

[21:07] <gutty333> so you guys don’t want him to beat it? The message at the end is a fitting conclusion. So sad 
[21:08] <kozatof> @killlmyself yeah 

[21:08] <sanvilla93> he can even glitch correctly, thats sad phil 

[21:08] <yodog268> look at a youtube video 

[21:08] <poopshortsjr> Search how to do it on YouTube, Phil. 

[21:08] <jv5_guy> its the timing thst will get you 

[21:08] <kozatof> Let the idiot do the glitch instead of playing the gayme 
[21:08] <calqlusl01> He could always use Dorrie Kappa 

[21:08] <darthradovanviking> the I swear it's like the song the band is playing is made for the glitch 
[21:08] <caper_three> check a youtube tutorial phil 

[21:08] <butter_my_bread> full illegitimate playthroughs 

[21:08] <butter_my_bread> LUL 

[21:08] <darkslayergod> There are still hard games 

[21:08] <voodookillz> i dont wanna see him glitch it to cheat but to just see if he can do it XD 
[21:08] <xxghostbritxx> oh that's easy 

[21:08] <neospartanhesperos9> @DarthRadovanViking i know what you mean LUL 

[21:08] <msdbzbabe> ok I saw a video, you jump first, release the frog, as your falling you switch on the 2nd

[21:08] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Just stop and quit already if you cana€™t do it 
[21:08] <caper_three> check on youtube 

[21:08] <neospartanhesperos9> @Butter_My_Bread LUL 

[21:08] <veramer> you hae to jump early maybe?

[21:09] <jv5_guy> ever hear of searching on ytube 

[21:09] <vashyoyo> unless youre some speed runner you wont be able to do this lol 
[21:09] <kozatof> But youa€™d rather do the frog glitch 

[21:09] <darthradovanviking> haha very funny go to gulag @Butter_My_Bread 

[21:09] <jv5_guy> a'fa / 'fa'fa / 'fa / 'fa'fa / 'f

[21:09] <snuka3000> PowerUpL AngryJack PowerUpR 

[21:09] <deepdrive3254> i remember phil doing this for a spyro game :D 

[21:09] <beatlesl2335> You really are going to ruin a fun game like this phil? You were almost there, dont be 
mad at the game like that? 

[21:09] <eldeadmariachi> @i_came_here_to_something Exactly. I love playing games like Uncharted on 
crushong, Ninja Gaiden in Master Ninja, qnd other games on the hardest difficult etc. I love the challenge and

[21:11] <caper_three> gotta do it up high 

[21:11] <i_came_here_to_something> @elDeadMariachi What I really hate are gamers who go around saying 
old games suck b/c they're too hard for them. A game being too hard for someone doesn't mean it sucks. And a 
game that isn't challenging is usually less engaging in keeping the player active with the game mechanics. 
[21:11] <thatanonybear> i enjoyed it lol 



[21:11] <kozatof> @majinboo3 whata€™s the point of this glitch if he gloats like he did legitly

[21:13] <i_came_here_to_something> @elDeadMariachi They also homogenize the game mechanics so people 
don’t have to learn unique skills, which makes the games more generic.
