[12:40] <darksydephil> aproxymate: in 2011 youtube changed channel pages, they stopped being like social 
media pages such as myspace/facebook so it was impossible to get other peoples videos noticed anymore, these 
vids used to blow up when i highlighted them on darksydephil but then it was impossible to get them noticed on 
dspgaming after the change, so they died out bigtime

[12:53] <bakedessert> need for lootbox speed 

[12:53] <crystalchemist> Phil...since your dad was a Marine did you ever thinking about enlisting? 

[12:54] <korewasugoi> Nfs will be "DSP drives it" 

[12:54] <eternia_forever> :D @theycallmejimbob @katexo234 
[12:54] <astrojetboy> The ending of WW2 is a little anticlimactic 

[12:54] <redhyruler> @quantumquinn is that positive over negative? Sounds like the words cancel themselves 
out. Fike the saying tho. 

[12:54] <korewasugoi> @Astrojetboy the whole game is anticlimactic 
[12:55] <theycallmejimbob> gotta go fast VoHiYo 
[12:55] <quantumquinn> It’s as positive as it gets! 

[12:55] <astrojetboy> Fol @korewasugoi I enjoyed it a little though 
[12:55] <eternia_forever> faster than light that sonic was last night sheesh

[12:56] <oldchipz> why hasnt phil made a t shirt with nothing i could do on it 
[12:56] <crystalchemist> Bloodborne DFC> anything 
[12:56] <fluttershyl970> sonic forces furry simulator Kappa 

[12:56] <korewasugoi> Sonic forces looks so unfinished tho, also the switch version is locked at 30fps :DDD 
[12:56] <quantumquinn> i laughed so hard at Phils COD zombies stream where that medic was just campong 
[12:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspSurpriseddsp 

[12:56] <eternia_forever> wild boys duran duran song have a listen its good 

[12:57] <katexo234> oh my Phil WutFace 

[12:57] <crystalchemist> Speed? Have you done meth? 

[12:57] <korewasugoi> Doom looks dope on the switch tho 
[12:57] <aes0411> People can choose which console they support 
[12:57] <eternia_forever> gamers on the go will @DarksydePhil 

[12:57] <theycallmetxt> Who's going to buy a game on Switch? Maybe people who could only afford a Switch? 
Just say in’. 

[12:57] <korewasugoi> @Eternia_Forever Phil doesnt play on the go 
[12:57] <theycallmejimbob> the pc port is supposedly crashing all the time 
[12:58] <bakedessert> 720p and 30 fps in 2017 WutFace 
[12:58] <marshmelons> are you gonna stream the hoizon zero dawn die? 

[12:58] <korewasugoi> the whole game is trash, 

[12:58] <eternia_forever> very true @KoreWaSugoi 
[12:58] <quantumquinn> midnight stream! 

[12:58] <korewasugoi> NFS payback is a non release 

[12:58] <lutherkujo> if i want portable gaming I’d just buy a PS vita or a 3ds 

[12:58] <crystalchemist> autists play farcry 



[12:58] <eternia_forever> anybody that not yet bought hzd hold off the complete edition is coming out soon 
[12:58] <marshmelons> i dont remember giant robots in far cry 
[12:59] <quantumquinn> game of the year? lol 

[12:59] <theycallmejimbob> if NFS provides half the laughs Forza Horizon 3 did it will be a worthwhile stream 
[12:59] <korewasugoi> nice Bangers font on that coffee cup.... 

[12:59] <crystalchemist> Plz play need for speed 

[12:59] <astrojetboy> IGN gave NFS: Payback a 5.9. Phil don't waste the $60 

[12:59] <oldchipz> yeah i love when phil plays driving games... wonder why he skipped Gran Turismo ?? 

[13:00] <korewasugoi> Sonic forces got an 5 

[13:00] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob :D dspHmm 

[13:00] <temoblanks> I read that the new NFS has microtransactions up the ass 

[13:00] <bakedessert> even ign shit on the new nfs 

[13:00] <korewasugoi> @TemoBlanks You gotta pay for the gas ingame 

[13:00] <thekinginyell0w> Play a winter themed game, not xmas games... those are all trash and will be a waste 
of time 

[13:00] <aes0411> @DarksydePhil NFS is one of those games that you should skip. You ought to focus on the 
current playthroughs 

[13:00] <crystalchemist> I hope it's in a tree less world 

[13:00] <eternia_forever> @bakedessert what score did they give it ? 

[13:00] <korewasugoi> @Eternia_Forever 5.9 or some shit 
[13:01] <eternia_forever> wtf seriously 

[13:01] <tomahawkings> If youa€™d grow a bigger moustache, youa€™d look a lot like mario, phil next 
Helloween goal!

[13:03] <rbreezay> Phil should wake up 7:00am and stream 8:00am-4:00pm. 30 minute Lunch Break. 

[13:03] <aes0411> It’s unfortunate that we support intoxication through patreon now 
[13:04] <grinnyzss> Seriously whats the appeal with alcohol its literally drugs 
[13:04] <grinnyzss> worse than marijuana 

[13:04] <theycallmejimbob> never heard of that katexo234 is it good dspHmm 
[13:04] <korewasugoi> alcohol is not that bad 

[13:04] <aes0411> @rbreezay Nobody is going to be awake at the time, or they will be in school 
[13:04] <darthradovanviking> or better @grinnyzss 

[13:04] <tomahawkings> Isna€™t there a tomato v8 drink? You can make a great bloody mary with that for 
x-mas!

[13:05] <grinnyzss> weed makes me feel great, alcohol makes me feel like im gonna die 
[13:05] <korewasugoi> @aes0411 im saying that its not bad to drink a beer in a party 

[13:05] <redhyruler> @darksydephil Why do you not do Lootcrate and 1-up unboxings anymore? Were they that 
bad? 

[13:05] <conky89> But wine has health benefits! 

[13:05] <aes0411> @KoreWaSugoi True, but intoxication is a different thing altogether 
[13:05] <sigint00> LMAO

[15:44] <kozatof> @sprank_n you already know 

[15:44] <chaosalltheway> tfw stealth in AC:0 was worse than in this game 
[15:44] <eternia_forever> some people call it a comeback cheer 117 

[15:44] <hodortarg> at least Venus keeps you hot = money on the heat saved easily monkaS 
[15:44] <kozatof> @eternia_forever that doesna€™t make sense 
[15:44] <paddingtonbearl87> some call it bumhum BegWan 
[15:45] <chaosalltheway> wolf 3D? 

[15:45] <furrywulfz> it probably was 
[15:45] <lickmybussy> omae wa mou shindeiru 
[15:45] <thatanonybear> no health n_N 

[15:45] <doctorzzz> i hated the difficulty in new order, it was way to easy on hardest 

[15:45] <thatanonybear> v_v 

[15:45] <eternia_forever> @kozatofwell 

[15:45] <furrywulfz> cause it was a doom style shooter 

[15:45] <olonel> he totally not play RTCW 

[15:45] <i_came_here_to_something> They couldn’t do a lot of real stealth b/c the engine couldn’t support it 
[15:45] <sprank_n> lol 

[15:45] <furrywulfz> you can’t stealth on that sorta game 

[15:45] <kozatof> @eternia_forever phil is save scumming 

[15:45] <tronsta> The original wolfenstine was a stealth game actually 

[15:45] <paddingtonbearl87> OCIFER. CrreamAwk CrreamAwk CrreamAwk 

[15:45] <dead_462> the original wolfenstein, before wolfenstein 3d was stealth focused i think 

[15:46] <butter_my_bread> doesn’t that get monotonous 

[15:46] <i_came_here_to_something> It was basically a 2D game using sprite scaling in a tiled space to create 
the impression of 3D. Concessions had to be made. 

[15:46] <chaosalltheway> basic assault with upgrades is the best gun in da game 

[15:46] <thiccbwoii> ya like the original doom 

[15:46] <i_came_here_to_something> @thiccbwoii Exactly. 

[15:47] <aes0411> How's everyone doing? I can't wait to pick up Doom for the Switch on Friday! I'm only 

hoping for a smooth frame rate and I'll be good 

[15:47] <kozatof> @aes0411 this game is crap

[15:49] <thatanonybear> vaporwave, it's a music genre LUL 

[15:49] <i_came_here_to_something> @thiccbwoii That's prob b/c Bethesda owns both franchises; easier to 
have them share engines in that case 

[15:49] <bos2161> Doesn't matter anyway. Human eye can’t see more than 240p @ 15fps
