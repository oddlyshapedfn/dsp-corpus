[13:45] <sprank_n> Nice 

[13:45] <alphablaq> whaa is it like a side story to the new movie? 

[13:45] <neospartanhesperos9> NotATK 

[13:45] <jannedaarcl35> Not so complex anymore :p 

[13:46] <butter_my_bread> I wonder how superfluous this star wars chapter will be. something tells me it'll be 

completely inconsequential in the grand scheme of things 

[13:46] <bethemadeagle> this is only the first mission guys just wait until later 

[13:46] <shega_ace> if you keep inter... smack! 

[13:46] <mademesignup> that fucking crouch walk animation

[13:46] <encelor> imperial skum 



[13:46] <kovorus> Kappa 

[13:46] <bos2161> Micro aggressions are a norm in the oppressive Rebel Alliance 

[13:46] <sardarkh> No, it's all the movie. You can avoid going to the theatre 

[13:46] <jannedaarcl35> pew pew

[13:47] <encelor> calamari face

[13:47] <encelor> delicious when fried 
[13:47] <sardarkh> You are watching one 

[13:47] <alphablaq> and why would they spoil the movie within a game? 

[13:47] <divanerasmus> dick shot;( 

[13:47] <paddingtonbearl87> G3p0 generic 

[13:47] <alphablaq> yes this is the first one ive seen in a long time is what I mean.. 

[13:47] <sardarkh> So you can purchase microtransaction content to proceed 
[13:48] <encelor> because movie ticket is 10$ and this game is 60$ 

[13:48] <jannedaarcl35> I like how the whole rebel force can't take one imperial soldier out. 

[13:48] <encelor> LUL 

[13:48] <paddingtonbearl87> its actually rated A/O

long time

[14:03] <encelor> you sure this sure looks like ewok planet

[14:05] <encelor> LUL 

[14:05] <conky89> I like Star Wars but I would not consider myself a fan of it. Nothing wrong with simple, 
escapist entertainment 

[14:05] <butter_my_bread> damn no left stick aiming while strafing is needed to out dps enemies huh 

[14:06] <butter_my_bread> maybe should of played on hard 

[14:06] <kushiyakitori> really generous with the regeneration as well as the damage enemies do 
[14:06] <paddingtonbearl87> TRAUNsports 
[14:07] <butter_my_bread> yea they do pitiful dmg 



[14:07] <theycallmejimbob> slow and steady Phil dspHmm 
[14:07] <encelor> well they do it to give you a power fantasy 

[14:07] <butter_my_bread> this game is just fan service and u can pretty much just sleep walk through it 

[14:07] <encelor> your damage is better then theirs 

[14:07] <butter_my_bread> campaign rather 

[14:08] <bethemadeagle> jim no GOTTA GO FAST

[14:09] <bethemadeagle> jim it better 

[14:09] <butter_my_bread> If this is Endor im gonna be pretty bummed if the Ewoks don't make an 

appearance. They beat the piss out of them just before this battalion got here 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> butter my bread this is endor and no the ewoks prob wont show up 

[14:10] <butter_my_bread> markSad markFeels 

[14:10] <12_btw_hahaha> @Butter_My_Bread this is a special forces division so they wont see the main 

frontlines like the standard troopers, the ewoks went up on the frontlines 
[14:11] <12_btw_hahaha> but still should see atleast 1 lol 
[14:11] <encelor> sllverTilt sllverSleeper sllverTilt 
[14:11] <encelor> jeez the birs chirping make me sleepy 
[14:12] <hidiebyel> when is drunk stream 

[14:12] <butter_my_bread> ah gotcha, admittedly ive been multi tasking this whole stream some i missed the 

story exposition 

[14:12] <conky89> "AT-ST’s! AT-ST’s!" 

[14:12] <nightbot> Conky89 -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning] 

[14:12] <tomahawkings> I see a wok over there 
[14:12] <coralguy> that was such a threat 
[14:13] <n4tur3boy> Is PSN DOWN? 

[14:13] <coralguy> no? 

[14:13] <bethemadeagle> encelor im sleepy this campaign is shit boring and easy and im losing my bet with jim 
[14:13] <bethemadeagle> so i am pissed 
[14:13] <darthradovanviking> don't be 

[14:13] <12 btw hahaha> If only this were you online Phil LUL 
[14:13] <martyl3612> whatz the bet 
[14:13] <darthradovanviking> nothing you could do behte 
[14:13] <demon4589> hello 

[14:13] <bethemadeagle> and no ewoks so i am annoyed 
[14:13] <divanerasmus> poor rebels 

[14:14] <darthradovanviking> the ewok genocide is missing that is true 
[14:14] <theycallmejimbob> no ewoks dspPepe 

[14:14] <darthradovanviking> let's just pretend they have already been eliminated 

[14:14] <butter_my_bread> ppl tend to be a little but better than recruit bots haha 

[14:14] <bethemadeagle> gotta shoot the ewoks in their cute teddy bear faces 
[14:14] <12_btw_hahaha> Dumb rebels taking cover behind a rail. 

[14:14] <butter_my_bread> markSad markSad markSad 

[14:15] <fluttershyl970> the lack of ewoks is disturbing 
[14:15] <jannedaarcl35> the ewoks have went instinct it seems 

[14:15] <butter_my_bread> this is when Star Wars starts to lose me. Jedi was my least favorite of the originals 

[14:15] <bionich00t> Did Phil see the downboats on leddit? 



[14:15] <bionichOOt> epic 

[14:16] <darthradovanviking> return of the jedi you mean? 

[14:16] <cnkxx> please someone explain that AI to me. 

[14:16] <butter_my_bread> yessir! 

[14:16] <clutchmanl973> I see they just ripped the AI straight from the last games skirmish mode,pathetic! 

[14:16] <cnkxx> what difficulty is this 

[14:16] <encelor> 20/20 aim LUL 

[14:16] <kushuluck> Wow AI just stands there lol 

[14:16] <bionich00t> Empire > New Hope > Revenge of the Sith > Force Awakens > Return > Attack of the 

Clones > Phantom Menace 

[14:16] <nasklaf> ...blaming the gun? 

[14:16] <conky89> Jedi is what I call the "third entry slump" which means when the third entry in a trilogy is the 
weakest one 

[14:16] <jannedaarcl35> I like how the AI just stand out in the open 

[14:16] <bethemadeagle> butter my bread return of the jedi is my second fave stars wars film out of the whole 
franchise 

[14:17] <bethemadeagle> my first fave is empire strikes back 
[14:17] <cnkxx> even bethesda AI at least tries to go to cover... 

[14:17] <jannedaarcl35> I liked RoJ too. 

[14:17] <bethemadeagle> then new hope 
[14:17] <martyl3612> which one is return of the jedi 
[14:17] <bethemadeagle> new hope is 3rd best i mean 
[14:17] <bethemadeagle> episode 6 

[14:17] <12_btw_hahaha> LUL cloth hat blocks a lethal blaster bolt 

[14:17] <bionich00t> RotJ is okay, but Ewoks suck, the ending is weak, and the story is dumb. Even Revenge 
and TFA are better. 

[14:17] <fluttershyl970> empire strikes is back is the best of the trilogy 

[14:17] <bethemadeagle> bionic i disagree 

[14:17] <darthradovanviking> agreed @fluttershyl970 

[14:17] <deepdrive3254> Yup empire is best movie 

[14:17] <conky89> Empire is still the best Star Wars movie overall 

[14:17] <martyl3612> what is 3's subtitle 

[14:17] <jannedaarcl35> I agree empire strikes back is the best but RotJ is up there for me 

[14:18] <butter_my_bread> id go Empire, A New Hope, Revenge of the Sith, Return of the Jedi, Phantom 

Menace, Force Awakens, Atk of the Clones 
[14:18] <bethemadeagle> fluttershy i agree 

[14:18] <bionich00t> I still like Return, mostly for the beginning with Jabba 
[14:18] <bionich00t> He is the best part by far 
[14:18] <deepdrive3254> But leia kissing Luke is great :D 
[14:18] <encelor> wincest 

[14:18] <butter_my_bread> Return and Menace are a toss up for me 

[14:18] <bionich00t> Menace LUL

[14:18] <martyl3612> what is 3 called 
[14:18] <nasklaf> Two words: Slave. Leia. 

[14:18] <bionich00t> Revenge of the Sith 

[14:18] <butter_my_bread> i really dont like Return heh 

[14:18] <martyl3612> true 

[14:18] <bionich00t> Return is okay, but I like Revenge more 



[14:18] <djrunol> I gotta admit, the graphics are insane 

[14:18] <vikutaurus> Epic looking game, too bad it has microtransactions by UBISOFT DEVILS 
[14:19] <tomahawkings> Gold. Bikini. 

[14:19] <encelor> jar jar screwed the empire 

[14:19] <conky89> Their was actually a short period of time a little while back where people were actually 

defending Phantom Menace 

[14:19] <encelor> fkingjarjar 

[14:19] <sprank_n> he means the senate 

[14:19] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> LUL LUL LUL LUL 

[14:19] <pl4guet4stic> LUL 

[14:19] <trihard41iife> damn even i dont know thst time line 
[14:19] <divanerasmus> loool 
[14:19] <vikutaurus> ack ack ack ack 

[14:19] <djrunol> what? dude i subbed like 4 days ago. way to go twitch 
[14:19] <jannedaarcl35> Ugh, the phantom menace= :( 

[14:19] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 
[14:19] <doctorzzz> well sidous all planed this 
[14:19] <conky89> perfect timing 

[14:19] <bionich00t> Phantom Menace was defended a little up until Mike Stoklasa released his infamous 2 hour 
long review of it 

[14:19] <doctorzzz> to clones n shit 
[14:19] <fluttershyl970> nani 

[14:19] <bionich00t> Then no one really could defend it anymore 

[14:19] <bionich00t> Revenge of the Sith is good though, but episode 1 and 2 suck 

[14:19] <martyl3612> did sidious fund the droids? 

[14:19] <nightbot> coralguy just tipped $5.45 
[14:19] <encelor> jar jar gave the council powa to palpatine 
[14:20] <iconicmasterl> Story time then crash 
[14:20] <ewojo> 'claps’ nice crash 

[14:20] <sprank_n> @Bionich00t i had a toke of weed today 
[14:20] <doctorzzz> ofc sidious contolled the federation 

[14:20] <jannedaarcl35> revenge of the sith was okay, the last part with darth vadar still makes me cringe 

[14:20] <bethemadeagle> empire strikes back, return of the jedi, new hope, force awakens, revenge of the sith, 

attack of the clones, episode 1 and then rogue one is my order of fave star wars movies 

[14:20] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob ayy we silver naw TriHard 

[14:20] <12_btw_hahaha> @martyl3612 no the separtists did 

[14:20] <nasklaf> I love red letter media. A fellow Wisconsin bro. 

[14:20] <theycallmejimbob> :D nice TriHard4Liife 
[14:20] <martyl3612> lmao 

[14:20] <bionich00t> Mike Stoklasa is great, did you see their newest BotW on Suburban Sasquatch 
[14:20] <vikutaurus> BLOWN the fuck out 

[14:20] <darthradovanviking> my favorite is the holliday special Kappa 
[14:20] <bethemadeagle> jimbob finally a death 
[14:20] <deepdrive3254> Cana€™t wait till last Jedi comes out 
[14:20] <paddingtonbearl87> fkn dummy 

[14:20] <bionich00t> Suburban Sasquatch BotW was funny as fuck 

[14:20] <doctorzzz> yeah 4 more weejs

[14:21] <doctorzzz> cant wait 

[14:21] <trihard41iife> LUL 

[14:21] <divanerasmus> looooooool 

[14:21] <vikutaurus> what the hell dood 



[14:21] <elcspx> ???... LUL 

[14:21] <12_btw_hahaha> well tie fighters are known for their frailty 

[14:21] <sprank_n> FailFish 

[14:21] <iconicmasterl> FailFish EleGiggle 

[14:21] <clutchmanl973> Yea I put 200hrs into the first one,not touching this garbage! 

[14:21] <deepdrive3254> Lol phil 5Y~, 

[14:21] <nasklaf> Nothing he could do. 

[14:21] <conky89> RLM is great. Although one thing about Mike Stoklasa is that contrary to popular belief, he 
is actually a much bigger fan of star trek than star wars 
[14:21] <bionich00t> Is this game suck? 

[14:21] <bethemadeagle> deep usually the second movie is better than the first and the 3rd tends to be just as 
good 

[14:21] <jannedaarcl35> cheerlOO What was your favorite Star Wars movie, Phil? 

[14:21] <fluttershyl970> at least boba fett was in the Christmas special 
[14:21] <bethemadeagle> anyway 2nd death jim 

[14:21] <leewanner> I clipped that hilarious moment from phil's stream just now... any mods want it? 

[14:22] <bionich00t> There's just a lot more of Star Trek to be a fan of than Wars @ Mike Stoklasa. Star Trek 
has tons of series, movies, and so on. Star Wars had only 2 trilogies. 

[14:22] <coralguy> Rogue one for the win 

[14:22] <bionich00t> Phil strikes me as a Phantom Menace fan 

[14:22] <encelor> the one with jar jar is best LUL 

[14:22] <theycallmejimbob> it begins BetheMadEagle NotLikeThis 

[14:22] <encelor> where mace windu get booted 

[14:22] <trihard41iife> I never minded Jar jar 

[14:22] <bionich00t> Try spinning that's a good trick 

[14:22] <ubermikeyb> Does the console version of this game have splitscreen pvp/galactic conquest like the 
original battlefront 211 

[14:22] <fluttershyl970> but if want a good laugh star wars Christmas special is still on youtube i think 
[14:22] <pl4guet4stic> @Bionich00t It's a crime to forget about both Clone wars shows 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> multiplayer seems too chaos like and this campaign is shit but i expected that 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> glad i didnt buy this 

[14:22] <butter_my_bread> All three prequels have Jar Jar but they shafted him on screen time after the first 

[14:23] <nazgorg> pew pew pew pew 

[14:23] <bionich00t> @PL4GUET4STIC Never saw those but everyone says they're the best part of the 
prequels. The other good part is Palpatine. I doubt Snoke can live up to the Emperor as a villain. 

[14:23] <bethemadeagle> it does begin jim 

[14:23] <butter_my_bread> actually i dont recall seeing him in Sith now that i think about it 

[14:23] <trihard41iife> shoot em up? cmonBruh 

[14:23] <bethemadeagle> dog fights arent gunna be good for you jim 

[14:23] <bionich00t> Jar Jar was in Sith but only for a few moments in the funeral scene 

[14:23] <paddingtonbearl87> pewpewpew 

[14:23] <fluttershyl970> right now luke is burning his up dad 

[14:24] <paddingtonbearl87> CrreamAwk 

[14:24] <pl4guet4stic> @Bionich00t They're really good in my opinion, they really dive into the politics of the 
world in Star Wars. Which I personally love. 

[14:24] <encelor> jar jar was kissing palpatine ass then somehow convinced the council to give palpatine full 
powa 

[14:24] <encelor> sllverWat 

[14:24] <darthradovanviking> Don’t question why you hear all these ambient sounds in the vacuum of space 

[14:24] <encelor> how does that work 

[14:24] <bionich00t> @PL4GUET4STIC Poliitics huh? 

[14:24] <encelor> jar jar from all things

[14:26] <paddingtonbearl87> WONDABAR 

[14:26] <neospartanhesperos9> b-b-b-but did they have Palpatine's permission to do this, cause he's dead, and 
this seems morally wrong. BabyRage 

[14:27] <sprank_n> is this game cannon with disney's star wars? 

[14:27] <encelor> not verified on facbook LUL

multiple protagonists imo 

[14:37] <neospartanhesperos9> yes, it's a grind 

[14:37] <kittyspank> a grind u cant pay through 

[14:37] <caspertheghost94> How do I go about getting into a game with Phil when he goes on multiplayer later? 
[14:37] <neospartanhesperos9> the grind seems reasonable, idk why people are bitching about it

[15:29] <encelor> kylesomething 

[15:29] <doctorzzz> i really hope tho rey is gonna go full dark side 

[15:29] <xdxcayx> im convinced she's either a chosen one reincarnate or a palpatine 

[15:29] <doctorzzz> another wilhelm 

[15:29] <convertedclone> DSP doesn’t give a crap about whether or not playing this is "selling out" he plays all 
the big releases 

[15:29] <dkpgames> He didn’t sell out he brought in the evolution of phil 
[15:29] <doctorzzz> what i really wanna know is who the fuck that snoak guy is 
[15:29] <12_btw_hahaha> @xDxcayx my momney is on being ezra bridgers daughter

[15:31] <xdxcayx> but Anikans saber called out to her 

[15:31] <encelor> @ConvertedClone just like you said 

[15:31] <encelor> its pretty dull 

[15:32] <encelor> kind off 

[15:32] <nazgull 15xd> like the game, boring 

[15:32] <doctorzzz> maybe ray is the child of shmee and wattoo 

[15:32] <doctorzzz> you never know 

[15:32] <dkpgames> Power point transition LOL 

[15:32] <doctorzzz> star wars always has those transitions, next time dont sleep while you watch 
[15:32] <doctorzzz> Kappa 

[15:32] <nazgull 15xd> i would be perfect if ray switch to the dark side and ren to the light side 

[15:33] <xdxcayx> she's gotta be chosen one reincarnated 

[15:33] <nazgull 15xd> there are some really good theories 

[15:33] <dkpgames> I cant help if is boring 

[15:33] <encelor> why can’t rey be a grey side jedi 

[15:33] <encelor> like amce 

[15:33] <encelor> mace windu 

[15:33] <encelor> harness both sides 

[15:33] <nazgull 15xd> in fact there is another theory that talks about that 
[15:33] <xdxcayx> Luke is also probs grey side 



[15:34] <adrian_digital> grey jedi not canon tho is it? 

[15:34] <encelor> it should be 

[15:34] <nazgull 15xd> it says that ray must be the perfect balance 
[15:34] <encelor> but disney 
[15:34] <encelor> i dunno 

[15:34] <doctorzzz> nah luke is too weak he is a pussy to use dark side 

[15:34] <djrunol> now why did Andromeda look like shit but the characters here look really good

[16:06] <darthradovanviking> if you say so @encelor 

[16:07] <bestcompilationofficial> There's probably going to be another game market crash like in 1983 due to 
these micro-transactions 

[16:08] <encelor> many EU countries are investgating lootboxes 

[16:08] <encelor> see if they are gambling 

[16:08] <blue_blur64> Well Nintendo will be fine :P 

[16:08] <encelor> if they are they will be abnned 

[16:08] <encelor> banned* 

[16:08] <darthradovanviking> I am glad they are taking care of such important things as lootboxes in videogames 
[16:08] <encelor> and starwars helped a lot with that 

[16:08] <thatanonybear> Deem lootboxes to be gambling, restrict them to Adult Only games, and bam, problem 
solves 

[16:08] <bestcompilationofficial> lol yes indeed Nintendo was one of few countries who actually grew 
throughout the crash

player only environments? 

[16:18] <doctorzzz> RAM SOLO 



[16:18] <blue_blur64> Uh Phil, I think this was supposed to be a stealth mission xD 

[16:18] <thatanonybear> @TemoBlanks for the most part, yep 

[16:19] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 77%? more like 15% tops 

[16:19] <blue_blur64> Oh, well nvm 

[16:19] <temoblanks> At least it's something 

[16:19] <dark_hunter_l 16> Keep playing on easy 

[16:19] <bestcompilationofficial> I thought you got banned

[16:20] <blue_blur64> Why does that guy's voice sound familiar? 

[16:20] <uf08mycat00> Re-use MP maps/assets, add a "story" and call it a "campaign".... yes well done DICE.... 

[16:20] <dark_hunter_l 16> Nope

[16:20] <thatanonybear> storm troopers casually walking into headshots 

[16:21] <blue_blur64> Ok, I was right that this is spposed to be a stealth mission xD 

[16:21] <dark_hunter_l 16> I am still here 

[16:21] <bestcompilationofficial> I don’t know what it is but I'm not that interested in games like I used to be. 
Maybe they all feel to similar now 

[16:21] <blue_blur64> Well you were banned dark, just as a joke 

[16:21] <thatanonybear> @bestcompilationofficial Try a new style, like NITW 

[16:21] <chairmancaleb> @bestcompilationofficial It could either be us getting older or games getting shittier. 
Or both. 

[16:21] <dark_hunter_l 16> Oh xD 

[16:21] <uf08mycat00> Big part of it is because game quality is decreasing 
[16:21] <blue_blur64> Wait, you didn’t even notice? brownLUL 

[16:22] <xeranarth> This SWTOR update sure did great things for that aging game. dspHinm 

[16:22] <rusty_bones> Han not so solo kinggBANANAPPL 

[16:22] <bestcompilationofficial> @ChairmanCaleb: Probably a bit of both 

[16:22] <blue_blur64> @uf08mycat00 Well good news is that the best games out this year are single player 

games, although the majority of them are open world ones 

[16:22] <dark_hunter_l 16> This is how you don’t play battlefront 2 

[16:22] <thatanonybear> this is how you don't troll stream chat 

[16:22] <uf08mycat00> True 

[16:23] <chairmancaleb> @bestcompilationofficial I feel the same as well. Don’t play that many games these 
days. 

[16:23] <bos2161> The troopers really just ought to take their armor off at this point. It’d be more comfortable, 
would improve their vision and agility too. Throughout all of Star Wars the armor hasn't ever done shit lol 
[16:23] <suckasurprise> @bestcompilationofficial If you're around my age it might have something to do with 
how expensive games are now, when I was in junior high and high school I could just rent the newest games at 
blockbuster for 6 bucks and finish the game over the weekend. I play a lot less games now because I can’t shell 
out 100 bucks everytime something new conies out 
[16:23] <kittyspank> arr im a pirate 

[16:23] <blue_blur64> Like, the top 10 games on Metacritic are better than the best multiplayer/lootbox game 
[16:23] <dark_hunter_l 16> I not a troll i just have some free time 
[16:23] <darthradovanviking> he was unlucky, aww 

[16:23] <bestcompilationofficial> oh yeah I miss the smell of blockbuster, deni memories 
[16:23] <blue_blur64> *game with lootboxes/microtransactions I mean 

[16:24] <bestcompilationofficial> had such a distinct smell and an emotional reaction to that smell lol 
[16:24] <blue_blur64> I saw the picture earlier today 

[16:24] <darthradovanviking> oh i forgot trolls are professionals that get payed @Dark_hunter_l 16 
[16:24] <thebigjeffproducktions> dspFun 



[16:24] <bos2161> Blockbuster, good times 

[16:24] <suckasurprise> yeah I remember the blockbuster smell too lol 
[16:24] <myfellowjohnson> who is doing voice acting for Solo? 

[16:24] <blue_blur64> I can look 
[16:24] <thatanonybear> George Harrison 
[16:24] <dark_hunter_l 16> Correct 

[16:24] <darthradovanviking> luke skywalrker @MyFellowJohnson 
[16:24] <kushiyakitori> Seth Green 

[16:24] <skillz08> hey stream question, i know both suck but my building only allows us to use Comcast or rcn. 
which one should i get for internet? 

[16:24] <dark_hunter_l 16> Bingo 

[16:24] <bos2161> so true, just thinking about Blockbuster smell makes me nostalgic lol 
[16:25] <myfellowjohnson> i thought Ford was done with this role 

[16:25] <bestcompilationofficial> Every time you smelled it it was like "Time for a new adventure, Oh Boy!" 
[16:25] <myfellowjohnson> they didn’t put much effort into the SP campaign did they.... 

[16:25] <blue_blur64> Han Solo is voiced by John Armstrong in this game 
[16:26] <thatanonybear> did the original Battleffronts have SP campaigns? 

[16:26] <xkeysx97> I recently got paid off at my job phil Ia€™m currently unemployed for the time being I now

[16:32] <kovorus> do a barrel roll 

[16:32] <thatanonybear> a bold "fly in a straight line towards the target" strategy 

[16:32] <bestcompilationofficial> @Kovorus: He's just trying to scrape by the mission. You think he's gonna do 
a barrel roll? 

[16:32] <thatanonybear> straight from Catch-22 

[16:32] <fluttershyl970> phill han solo hates this game so much he killing himself 

[16:32] <myfellowjohnson> DICE has really dropped the ball, used to be pride of Sweden. Now the guys behind 
amnesia/Soma picked that ball up 
[16:33] <blacksunblood> do a jheri curl 
[16:33] <kovorus> he did 

[16:33] <brownbearking90> tHESE WANNABE STAR FOX PILOTS 

[16:33] <nightbot> Brownbearking90 -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[16:33] <bestcompilationofficial> This reminds me of that mission in cod black ops 2 
[16:33] <bestcompilationofficial> where you fly the jet in the Madam president mission 
[16:33] <bos2161> Second Amnesia was pretty shitty imo lol 
[16:33] <thatanonybear> this reminds me of an aneurysm 
[16:34] <bos2161> First is a gem though 

[16:34] <thefuryl> cheer20 Would you consider making youtube videos of your compilations of best/ funniest 
moments per game or playthrough because I would really want to see that 
[16:34] <myfellowjohnson> they didnt make the second one 
[16:34] <fluttershyl970> nice shot don’t get ccky 

[16:34] <ricosroughnecksO> There is a theory that the main character in this game is Reys mom 



[16:34] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @thefuryl RlyTho 
[16:34] <bos2161> Did too lol. 

[16:34] <thatanonybear> i thought the main character in this game was the lootbox 
[16:34] <bos2161> Machine for pigs or something 

[16:35] <bestcompilationofficial> @ThatAnonyBear wouldn’t put it past them LOL 

[16:35] <xkeysx97> In my opinion all these new games that come out just dona€™t give you that fun feeling 
that you used too get off of all the old games for 360 ps2 etc games just went downhill since the next gem 
console came only thing good going for them now are the graphics 
[16:35] <myfellowjohnson> they keep raping the storyline 
[16:35] <encelor> i am back 

[16:35] <yorkbork> Really liked this momenthttps://clips.twitch.tv/TangentialAverageDurianHeyGirl 
[16:35] <therealandyl> stars wars after the original trilogy LUL 
[16:35] <encelor> aliens? 

[16:35] <ricosroughnecksO> Because no one uses the forums lol 
[16:36] <kittyspank> theres lots of funny moments vids of him out there :) 

[16:36] <encelor> spacewhales? 

[16:36] <darthseverussnow> Does Phil only respond to people that give him money? 

[16:36] <darthradovanviking> there have been some funny clips. I don’t know how easy they are to compilse 
though cheer 100 

[16:36] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 
[16:36] <encelor> sllverWat 

[16:36] <thiemontime> @DarthSeverusSnow Basically yes 

[16:36] <sam_scratch2> forums are deader than ko gaming @DarksydePhil 

[16:36] <myfellowjohnson> tbh ep 1-3 were fine, they introduced a lot of politics and shit which I appreciate 
[16:36] <blue_blur64> Ok, I was scrolling through her work (she did so much stuff, god damn) and found that 
Maz's VA was the voice of Carmelita in Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time. I knew I heard that voice from somewhere 
[16:36] <thatanonybear> cheerlO i think since Twitch lets us clip your funny moments, people do that now 
instead of nominating 

[16:36] <encelor> awww couldn’t read that in time 

[16:36] <xkeysx97> No he responds too good messages comments that interests him I think plus therea€™s too 
many too reply too so a think he just picks now and then 
[16:37] <darthseverussnow> Yeah fair point xkeysx97 

[16:37] <i_came_here_to_something> @xkeysx97 that's only if you play big-budget AAA Western games. 
There's a lot more out there than just those games. This year alone we got Persona 5, Sonic Mania, BOTW, 
ARMS, Splatoon 2, Mario Odyssey, Super Lucky's Tale, A Hat In Time, and a lot more. 

[16:37] <thiemontime> @xkeysx97 you know that aint too true 
[16:37] <encelor> compile? 

[16:37] <thatanonybear> compile LUL 
[16:37] <darthradovanviking> compile 
[16:37] <darthradovanviking> the twitch clips 
[16:37] <paddingtonbearl87> rip spelling 
[16:37] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 

[16:38] <stormrage_101> There must have been something in dark souls 3: the ringed city 
[16:38] <stormrage_101> Dark souls always gives funny moments 

[16:38] <thebigjeffproducktions> @DarksydePhil Couldn’t you just pull moments from your most-viewed 
Twitch clips? 

[16:38] <doctorzzz> you can look in your CLIP directiory on twitch tho right ? 

[16:38] <kittyspank> sadly phil doesnt understand what of his is funny 
[16:38] <thebigjeffproducktions> Yeah 

[16:38] <ricosroughnecksO> But no one is going to go to the fourms. If you use discord, twitch clips or ask on 
twitter i think you will get better answers to funny clips 
[16:38] <thatanonybear> hundreds of dsp clips a day? dayu

[16:40] <encelor> i thought phil was not gonna do funniest clips anymore 
[16:40] <unquietmist> So how is the story so far? 

[16:40] <ricosroughnecksO> Twitter probably be better because most people have twitter accounts. I dont thi nk 
most people would sign up to phils site. 

[16:40] <xkeysx97> All those people that troll phil are just a waste of space tbh Ia€™ve been watching him for 8 
years and still too this day hea€™s the only one I watch and that actually interest me all those other top you 
tubers just give me a sore head from how shitty they are thata€™s my opinion anyway 

[16:40] <thefuryl> cheer 10 are you still doing reviews because you were one of the only people I liked watching 
reviews from on youtube? 

[16:40] <sprank_n> hes not 
[16:41] <thefuryl> damn 

[16:41] <bos2161> He's not. They get auto demonetized. 

[16:41] <encelor> why phil not put on his main channel unedited? 

[16:41] <thatanonybear> what a bloodbath 
[16:41] <thatanonybear> NIEC

[16:41] <i_came_here_to_something> I get that you like Phil and all but damn, he's not the ONLY Youtuber that 
puts out decent stuff. You can barely call him a Youtuber anymore b/c his priority is Twitch these days. 

[16:42] <jack_spartacus> cheer 15 I was in and out of the stream so I miss some of it. What do you thi nk of the 
game so fare? 

[16:42] <ricosroughnecksO> Yeah YouTubers are people who edit and make parodies. Phil is a streamer. 

[16:43] <xkeysx97> Yeah obviously therea€™s other decent youtubers but you know where I was coming from 
therea€™s not a lot out there than there used too be 
[16:43] <encelor> hipster 

[16:43] <encelor> always do something to mainstream stuff 
[16:43] <kittyspank> atleast the faces are better than mass effect 

[16:43] <thatanonybear> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Exactly, Game Sack does some incredible stuff on

[16:43] <xxghostbritxx> will phil play multiplayer today?

[16:49] <kittyspank> phil does say body a lot huh 
[16:50] <blue_blur64> Some body? Kappa 
[16:50] <doctorzzz> i havent exploded in days 



[16:50] <doctorzzz> too much work and dsp 

[16:50] <i_came_here_to_something> I'm not really into CoD personally, but it's nice for fans there's people who 
put quality CoD content out there to watch. Wish I could say the same for more obscure games. 

[16:50] <sprank_n> @DoctorZzZ no explosion november Kappa 

[16:50] <kovorus> somebody once told me 

[16:50] <britishgamingblack> Micheal Bay put those barrels there 

[16:51] <thatanonybear> i love AVGN, King of Youtube 

[16:51] <blue_blur64> HOW IS THAT GUY NOT ALERTING THEM! 

[16:51] <thatanonybear> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkAGlvVHaxM 

[16:51] <djrunol> del is black, it would be racist to shoot him. the white stormtrooper knows that 

[16:51] <butter_my_bread> it's a mission failsafe

[16:52] <djrunol> does he have a shield skill? 

[16:52] <djrunol> why not use it? 

[16:52] <i_came_here_to_something> I really miss AVGN’s gaming content. I get why he doesn’t do it as much, 
but I liked his gaming stuff the most. But it's cool, I got other YTers I can watch for that stuff now 
[16:52] <bestcompilationofficial> I never even played this game ita€™s just common sense 
[16:52] <blue_blur64> Because defense is stupid Kappa 

[16:52] <britishgamingblack> cheerlO michael bay doesn’t want you to get past those barrels 
[16:52] <stormrage_101> use the for- oh wait wrong character

[16:54] <i_came_here_to_something> OTG's a really good LPer as well. I also like watching Gameplay + Watch
