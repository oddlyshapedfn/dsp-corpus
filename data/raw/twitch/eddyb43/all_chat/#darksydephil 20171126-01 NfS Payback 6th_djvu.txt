[13:34] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil think about NFS history Forza is a copy of NFS hands down NFS has 
been around forever 

[13:34] <korewasugoi> 5 minutes listening to the soundtrack = terrible, ok 

[13:34] <thuswindburnl993> well there are different types of races, and it's all one big map, so they could only 
do so much location-wise... 

[13:34] <wxrxaxtxh> its the man himself. 

[13:34] <segregate> bruh 

[13:34] <bethemadeagle> jim well he had rewind

[13:36] <baylessthegO> that guy has the worst mexican accent ever 
[13:36] <rockstar0182> this is one of the worst nfs 

[13:36] <secretbossfight> I think ita€™s funny they renamed the Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge after gambling in 
this game. Also, just the theme of gambling in a lootbox EA game. 

[13:36] <majinboo3> Thats why i hate reacing games the AI cheats like no other 

[13:36] <wackdance> @WxRxAxTxH yeah true , but sometimes the innocent ones get burned down 

[13:36] <x_kevinl980_x> to much complaining 

[13:36] <korewasugoi> the run is the worst

[13:36] <grsicki> @DarksydePhil this game should have auto drive like in final fantasy 15 Kappa 



[13:36] <quantumquinn> This game honestly doesn't strike me as a "new game" here in 2017 it looks like 
something i played in 2012 

[13:36] <theycallmejimbob> he came close to exiting the game over the drifting BetheMadEagle it doesn't bode 

well for the more difficult races NotLikeThis

[13:37] <segregate> materialized 

[13:37] <thuswindburnl993> yeah that's my biggest complaint with this game so far is the rubberbanding on the 

AI

[13:52] <masternutella> How does 144 fps monitor look like 
[13:52] <bethemadeagle> MOAR HARD RACES 

[13:52] <lord_dink> taxes suck, homeless people in Canada got it made, no taxes plus $700 a month free i think. 

I might do that later in life, not be homeless but just live off $700 a month eating noodle soup and macaroni and 



cheese 

[13:52] <cedric_mp> uh oh 

[13:52] <bentboxer> san francisco vs Seattle seahawks phil is winning 

[13:52] <nightbot> Game Devs just tipped $3.00 

[13:52] <chairmancaleb> @Lord_Dink Well yeah...they're homeless... 

[13:52] <djrunol> @blue_blur64 watch totalbicuits nfs rivals 30/60 fps video to see the difference Kappa 
[13:52] <majinboo3> is that MorT? 

[13:53] <thuswindburnl993> lol he's SO bad at drifting. 

[13:53] <bentboxer> what is that a camero? 

[13:53] <drowningfishl2> I think Phil forgot how to drift all of a sudden 

[13:53] <theycallmejimbob> Phil should do a retro playthrough of destruction derby dspHmin 

[13:53] <sethl89> the human eye can detect artifacts in videos running at 500 fps so take that as you will 

[13:53] <bethemadeagle> lol jim yes 

[13:53] <bethebaby> Get a different car then. 

[13:53] <bentboxer> 500 bits per second thats some smooth graphics 

[13:53] <lord_dink> But in Canada they still get $700 a month from government for free so if they were smart 
they could save up 

[13:53] <quantumquinn> I had no idea who Phil was until his cyber stalkers gave him enough publicity to catch

[13:53] <bethemadeagle> ghost and shade are too fast 

[13:53] <katexo234> we need an HD Reboot of the game Called Wet 

[13:54] <mrjekylll6> It doesn’t matter what the eye can see. 60 fps is smoother then 30 

[13:54] <djrunol> @scoopula take a shot everytime phil drives in a car. if you want to die that is 

[13:54] <masternutella> What does AI rubberband mean? Like when your ahead of a car and he somehow 

catches up? 

[13:54] <bethemadeagle> kate wasnt that in HD on ps3 

[13:54] <thuswindburnl993> @DarksydePhil go to the dealership and sell this camaro and get the Honda NSX 
instead. It's a much better racing car. The camaro is better for drag races or police missions 
[13:54] <scoopula> @DJRunol lol 

[13:54] <bausleyfred> @QuantumQuinn ya man phil has tons of video of other people posting about him on

tho :/ 

[13:54] <cedric_mp> I like listening to this while writing my papers. Phil's rage stimulates the frontal lobe. 
Anyone have any opinions on why Britain joined WWI in 1914? 

[13:54] <majinboo3> its all about drifting son 
[13:54] <superslygaming> cassandra aint letting up 
[13:54] <baylesstheg0> then you should learn how to drive

[13:54] <scoopula> @MasterNutella It means that no matter how good you drive or how fast you go the AI will 
always be right behind you
