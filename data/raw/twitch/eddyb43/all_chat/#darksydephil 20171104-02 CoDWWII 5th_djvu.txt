[19:41] <zahvone> Phil, what do you think of the MP so far? Personally I think it's kind of quick, but much 
better than the previous 4 games. 

[19:41] <eliteshadowninja> Stream is good SeemsGood 
[19:41] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Yup 

[19:41] <darksydephil> cool ill tweet it out, maybe we can hit 300 subs tonight! 

[19:41] <sirnoblex> Hopefully 
[19:41] <comfrtblynumb> heey ppl! 

[19:41] <darksydephil> Zahvone it's better than every modern-esque COD besides Modern warfare IMO 
[19:41] <sirnoblex> Hey @comfrtblynumb 
[19:41] <comfrtblynumb> nice Phil! 

[19:41] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> 300 hype 

[19:41] <kinggoken> has dsp tried da zombie mode yet or nah 

[19:41] <gamemaster8814> I'm trying to decide if I wanna take a break from grinding out levels to watch the 
stream lol 

[19:41] <darksydephil> but i thi nk the original games just had charm in their simplicity 
[19:41] <sirnoblex> @DarksydePhil I agree. 

[19:41] <bentboxer> modern warfare is unbeatable it has kevin spacey in it 
[19:41] <gamemaster8814> watch* 

[19:41] <thatanonybear> @DarksydePhil v astute 

[19:42] <zahvone> I think this game is fantastic, probably deserves more attention lol 
[19:42] <kinggoken> lrnao @bentboxer 

[19:42] <samrlaseter> kevin spacey is bad now though, we can't appreciate anything he did 

[19:42] <thatanonybear> COD: Big Red One is still my fav of the series, simple but effective story/gameplay 

[19:42] <samrlaseter> i had to throw away my copy of the usual suspects 

[19:42] <it_hurts_daddy> No need to fear daddy is here 

[19:43] <samrlaseter> hi daddy welcome to the DSP stream 

[19:43] <thatanonybear> im never watching kevin spacey hit on teens in American Beauty again! 

[19:43] <darksydephil> just watch American Beauty over and over, Spacey is a complete scumbag in that one so 
it feels good lol 

[19:43] <glitch_crazed> dspHmm 

[19:44] <samrlaseter> i mean everyone in that movie was kind of a jerk 
[19:44] <zahvone> loool 

[19:44] <darksydephil> yeah thats a movie of like, all realistic villains 

[19:44] <it_hurts_daddy> Ita€™s crazy to think how many rich powerful guys in Hollywood are like him and 



Harvey 

[19:44] <thatanonybear> a movie where spacey loses his job and works fas food, then gets shot? :D 

[19:44] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Kevin Spacey is really like his character from Se7en LUL 

[19:44] <darksydephil> i bet its not just guys either, its just anyone in power, they abuse that shit all the time i’m 

sure but nobody says shit be everyone wants to work 

[19:45] <thatanonybear> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce he's in that one? 

[19:45] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> the killer, yeah 

[19:45] <solid_fantasy> American Beauty is actually one of my favorite movies. Spacey being scum irl doesn’t 
change that 

[19:45] <samrlaseter> yep, when people think they are important they become assholes 
[19:45] <samrlaseter> it's a fundamental law of nature 

[19:45] <darksydephil> look at Toby Turner, guy only had a stupid as fuck youtube channel but even he did 
fucked up stuff to girls who were just starstruck, or knew he was their ticket to fame 
[19:45] <thatanonybear> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce holy shit, i never woulda recognizzed him 
[19:45] <sirnoblex> Yup 

[19:45] <it_hurts_daddy> And ita€™s shitty cause Ia€™m sure a lot of other celebrities know whata€™s going 
on, but no one wants to be the whistle blower 

[19:46] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> @thatanonybear Kevin Spacey at his finest for me 
[19:46] <thatanonybear> an irredeemable creep? 

[19:46] <gamemaster8814> Hey @DarksydePhil have you ever prestiged in any call of duty? 

[19:46] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Hea€™s still a good actor

[20:04] <kozatof> @timboslicegb what you mean by been with trolls 

[20:04] <chairmancaleb> @chalupaprince, And it was very convoluted. I mean, we did have Pearl Harbor 
happen, so tensions were very high in case we had any spies in the country. It was an all out mess really.

[20:24] <talionshadowl 138> harder to hit guys in prone 

[20:24] <shadowx22222> This feels like MvCi's multiplayer with all the desyncs and bugs. 

[20:24] <deepdrive3254> isn’t that a spoiler anony? Kappa 
[20:25] <kingjezal> White-Luck right there 

[20:25] <johngaltwho> The Xbox was working perfectly this morning. Idk about now. 

[20:25] <samrlaseter> cheerlO the developers have no excuse for such poor game mechanics at this point in the 
franchise life 

[20:25] <kozatof> @johngaltwho spoilers in the year 2000+10+7 
[20:25] <vilky_p> phil needs to sit closer to the tv

[20:25] <deepdrive3254> :D no worries anony i think its ok if we say how far hes progressed if we don't give 
any plot away 

[20:26] <johngaltwho> Yeah that's not a spoiler as far as I'm concerned. 

[20:26] <oneuglyrugby> May Lay 

[20:26] <kwyjibo32> The only thing that's delayed is Phil's brain

[20:26] <sir_longarm25> why didn't they just remake world at war instead of this ): 

[20:27] <stunted> They fucked it up Kappa 

[20:27] <convertedclone> it's not dropshot if they're prone for 3 seconds 
[20:27] <johngaltwho> Cause World at War is still amazing 
[20:27] <thatanonybear> @ratchefanl2 hey fam tosHi 
[20:27] <samrlaseter> well that was just BULLSHIT 

[20:27] <talionshadowl 138> what does he mean by dropshotting? aren’t they just straight up going through the 
fla nk s? 

[20:27] <samrlaseter> why does running into bullets result in death in this game? 

[20:27] <slowbrosif> how did they fuck this game up? 

[20:27] <lvlpower> just does not like a $60 game 

[20:27] <johngaltwho> Drop shotting is when you go prone in the middle of a firelight 
[20:27] <vilky_p> phils kd atio 
[20:27] <vilky_p> ratio 

[20:27] <solid_fantasy> Triple's H sledgehammer is only person Phil, give him time to iron out the issues

[20:28] <thatanonybear> @vilky_p like my gpa, 1-40 :( 

[20:28] <bos2161> PogChamp 

[20:28] <convertedclone> yeah, but it's only if you prone as a reaction so the target moves. If they're sitting in 
prone they’re not dropping 

[20:28] <cheekyfries> dsp you should start drop-shotting, improvise, adapt, overcome. 

[20:28] <silvianraccoon> Uuuuuuhhhh 

[20:28] <johngaltwho> @thatanonybear any more Frenchmen this evening? 

[20:28] <samrlaseter> @Silvianraccoon why would you watch an angryjoe review, the guy is just low quality 
garbage

[20:30] <popsicolo> This isn’t my grandfather’s WWII NotLikeThis

[20:30] <cheekyfries> Of the three 

[20:30] <timboslicegb> ghost was better then iw and aw

[20:31] <popsicolo> But it had dogs and fish AI, Phil! popsicSmug 
[20:31] <sirJongarm25> cod 4 and waw the golden age 

[20:31] <gamemaster8814> @DarksydePhil Na, Advanced Warfare was worse. 

[20:31] <timboslicegb> advance warfar was worse 
[20:31] <cheekyfries> I liked MW2 

[20:31] <talionshadowl 138> but 4 was praised because of the drastic changes that worked for the better for the 
series 

[20:31] <cheekyfries> MW2 was my fav 

[20:31] <thatanonybear> COD2 was brilliant for its time, one of my fav 360 games 
[20:31] <thiccbwoii> ya but the story mode in this game is goood 
[20:31] <johngaltwho> MW2 was great but COD 4 was awesome. 

[20:31] <kekon3> I liked the maps of 3 a heck ton 

[20:31] <greddy2323> MW2 REMASTERED, i will buy QUICKLY! 

[20:31] <hindae> MW2 was the best i think, since it took MW1 and improved pretty much everything 

[20:31] <greddy2323> if it comes out 

[20:31] <johngaltwho> COD 2 on 360 yessss 

[20:31] <kekon3> that big map with large farm on the side 

[20:31] <thiccbwoii> nip seems Ike the same ol crap 



[20:31] <silvianraccoon> But terrible connections, phil? 

[20:31] <convertedclone> 4 was best cause it was balanced. MW2 was lightyears ahead in a million ways, but 

the game was a mess sometimes 

[20:31] <johngaltwho> No Russian 

[20:32] <johngaltwho> MW2 had a lot of bad glitches 

[20:32] <genesisdestiny> missed 

[20:32] <kekon3> small town with a farm on the side, I still somewhat remember it 
[20:32] <huffysan> Why they didn’t just remake COD 2? 

[20:32] <popsicolo> The next Call of Duty should go full on meme trash. 

[20:32] <genesisdestiny> they moved 

[20:32] <speedweed_> he moved 

[20:32] <convertedclone> ... 

[20:32] <samrlaseter> what a TERRIBLE game 
[20:32] <vilky_p> oh boy 

[20:32] <cheekyfries> @HinDae That's the way I feel too, except it had a lot of OP shit like One Man Army with 
Noob tubes 

[20:32] <bigljuicy> Why are his YouTube views so low? 

[20:32] <talionshadowl 138> @ConvertedClone ohoooo man I should tell you about this one time I got into this 

one match where this guy's turret always kept shooting through walls 

[20:32] <oneuglyrugby> lol 

[20:32] <talionshadowl 138> that was a hot mess 

[20:32] <samrlaseter> by the way, is phil playing pokemon ultra sun/moon? 

[20:32] <jack_spartacus> cheer 15 were is the quick time with rat? 

[20:32] <popsicolo> I doubt it @SamRLaseter 

[20:32] <johngaltwho> Soon he’s going to treat sledgehammer with the same reverence he treats FromSoft and 
Kojima with 

[20:33] <popsicolo> I kind of regret not waiting a year for Ultra Moon. 

[20:33] <popsicolo> I'm not buying it again. 

[20:33] <oneuglyrugby> is Phil unfamiliar with strafing? 

[20:33] <cheekyfries> @JohnGaltWho I don't think so, DSP vs Hideo Kojima is up their in the Top 10 Anime 
Battles 

[20:33] <timboslicegb> the bbig cod players think this best cod since bo2.most hated aw 

[20:33] <cheekyfries> Of All Time 

[20:33] <kekon3> strafing don't do much with the auto aim in these games 
[20:33] <thatanonybear> @CheekyFries LUL 
[20:33] <huffysan> @Oneuglyrugby It's not Doom. 

[20:33] <vilky_p> now phil is having fun 

[20:33] <hindae> @cheekyfries At least it wasnt 1 fucking loadout for every single player, i.e. Stopping Power 
Juggernaut 

[20:33] <talionshadowl 138> @JohnGaltWho I wouldn’t necessarily say Phil outright dislikes FromSoft and 
Kojima. 

[20:34] <tohotal69> LUL There GRILL Just Twerking On Twitch, 
WTF:https://picshd.net/gallery/Screenshot_3znKA5Hs.png EleGiggle 
[20:34] <nightbot> tohotal69 -> Please don’t post links, [warning] 

[20:34] <samrlaseter> @Popsicolo i might buy the version I don’t have 
[20:34] <talionshadowl 138> he respects them for making good games, 

[20:34] <johngaltwho> @talionshadowl 138 he shit on kojima A LOT 

[20:34] <talionshadowl 138> just doesn't see them at the level of praise others gives 

[20:34] <oneuglyrugby> I havent tested it bit the auto aim doesnt feel that strong to me in this Cod 

[20:34] <talionshadowl 138> @JohnGaltWho ohhhh I know how much he shits on Kojima. 

[20:35] <slowbrosif> great reload phil 

[20:35] <kekon3> Like, I honestly never took phils dislikes as legit hate, just like that friend you can talk shit 




with at this point 

[20:35] <johngaltwho> Metal Gear Kojima Sons of kojima 

[20:35] <cheekyfries> Black ops 3 had Spectre who had a badass knife thing, I played as him a lot 
[20:35] <tengu_stoner> Commando pro 
[20:35] <popsicolo> OCTUNE SHIEBE 

[20:35] <johngaltwho> I just watched his bloodborne die play through last night so I may be biased 
[20:35] <oneuglyrugby> relative to previous ones ofc 

[20:35] <timboslicegb> i dont get people they say we want diff cod so the get jet pack thenn people say old cod 
plz and they get angry no one is happy with call of duty 

[20:36] <talionshadowl 138> on the topic of Kojima though. I'm heavily anticipating how Death Stranding is 
gonna turn out 

[20:36] <kekon3> Something phil really doesn't like is SF5, and you know how he feels about that. 

[20:36] <kekon3> that's a legit thing 

[20:36] <johngaltwho> @timboslicegb they keep adding in all this stuff that doesn't improve or add to the game 
[20:36] <thatanonybear> yea he HATES SF5 

[20:36] <solid_fantasy> Nothing can please every single person , it's impossible 
[20:36] <samrlaseter> WHAT dude this is lame 

[20:36] <johngaltwho> SF V is legit fucked up. I don't question him on that 
[20:36] <kekon3> Call of Duty turned into Titanfall and Halo Reach 
[20:36] <silvianraccoon> The difference is Tokid didn’t give SFV lol 
[20:36] <johngaltwho> Titanfall was so good though 
[20:36] <kekon3> those were the games at the time it started changing 

[20:36] <samrlaseter> cheerlO phil your teammates must be french, they're just as useless as the real french in 
WW2 

[20:36] <timboslicegb> cod is fps what more you want 

[20:37] <talionshadowl 138> @Kekon3 those are pretty good games though. Reach especially 
[20:37] <talionshadowl 138> Titanfall didn't get good until 2 

[20:37] <hindae> Call of Duty rips off everything it can, Deus Ex, Elite Dangerous, Titanfall, everything 

[20:37] <samrlaseter> and that is just a joke, I know the french fought valiently 

[20:37] <silvianraccoon> Tokido didn’t give up playing SFV 

[20:37] <timboslicegb> titan fall 1 was awful 2 was decent 

[20:37] <talionshadowl 138> Tokido's still playing SFV though 

[20:37] <kekon3> they were what lead the industry at the time, so everyone followed 

[20:37] <johngaltwho> I enjoyed titanfall 1 more than 2 but I didn’t get to the campaign yet 

[20:37] <talionshadowl 138> no way he’s gonna drop it this early after winning EVO 

[20:37] <kekon3> Tokido playing SFV doesn’t mean much 

[20:38] <silvianraccoon> Lol 

[20:38] <kekon3> japan hates that game from what the Osaka scene has told 

[20:38] <cheekyfries> At least this game has the French, BF1 didn't even have them LUL 

[20:38] <kekon3> "Work Fighter 5" it was dubbed 

[20:38] <hindae> 2 was far superior to 1, especially after they added proper PvE, felt complete after that point 
[20:38] <lil_summrs> lol.. 

[20:38] <johngaltwho> I'll have to revisit it 

[20:38] <kekon3> SF4 is still huge in japan, and for good reason, that game is great 
[20:38] <cheekyfries> Pay us for DLC then you'll get the full WW1 experience LUL 
[20:38] <johngaltwho> I'm trying to get through Emily wants to play. My poor heart. 

[20:38] <huffysan> Yeah. 

[20:38] <kekon3> but even Mike Ross has dropped SF5, and he used to be a face for SF 
[20:38] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho why??? 

[20:39] <speedweed_> rip 

[20:39] <thatanonybear> that game looks abhorrent 
[20:39] <cheekyfries> HOW 



[20:39] <lvlpower> At less I didn’t bought duty 
[20:39] <cheekyfries> FUN 

[20:39] <kekon3> ask him about it and he just shuts up and walks away, ask him about Guilty Gear and he's a 
chatter box 

[20:39] <thatanonybear> speaking of abhorrent, SLEDGEHAMMER 
[20:39] <kinggoken> linao 

[20:39] <timboslicegb> one thing i miss from cod is 3rd person 
[20:39] <johngaltwho> @thatanonybear it's actually really cool. A better FNAF imo 
[20:39] <slowbrosif> firing a machinegun from the hip isn't very accurate phil 
[20:39] <cheekyfries> "I'm not a clown" 

[20:39] <nightbot> guitarplayerl939 just tipped $5.00 

[20:39] <hindae> Call of Duty "Shit, Battlefield beat us to WW1 so we'll settle for this shit again" WW2 
[20:39] <teamzarbi> not a clown 

[20:39] <gamemaster8814> @DarksydePhil Are you going to play other modes tonight? Or are you just doing a 
stream for War? 

[20:39] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho i never gave it a fair chance, it just looks bad :P 
[20:40] <cheekyfries> oops 

[20:40] <silvianraccoon> I love ppl editing dsp's gaming 
[20:40] <cheekyfries> soz boys 

[20:40] <johngaltwho> It's only five bucks so not a huge investment :D 
[20:40] <hindae> Increased range yes 

[20:40] <huffysan> Playing 3 days early to be OP on launch day. 

[20:40] <kekon3> @CheekyFries no apologizing, you mocked my clown lifestyle, that is unforgivable Kappa 

[20:40] <kekon3> take your Is slaps 

[20:41] <cheekyfries> I'll take the L @Kekon3 

[20:41] <johngaltwho> Oh no Phil 

[20:41] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho LUL

[20:41] <timboslicegb> why would die suck 

[20:41] <kekon3> FeelsBadMan 

[20:41] <zombiebeer> Post game lobbies are fucked 

[20:41] <hindae> Any UK viewers hype for bonfire night tonight? 

[20:41] <samrlaseter> this game is garbage 

[20:41] <super_skyhawk_x_> poopy connection PJSalt 

[20:41] <jack_spartacus> cheerl5 if you want you can use the 1911 now. 

[20:41] <samrlaseter> unadulterated garbage 

[20:41] <timboslicegb> die for swbf 1 was better then main game lol 
[20:41] <sneaky_vape> Whoever's fixing the servers could sure use some jetpacks 
[20:42] <cheekyfries> Phil play the most obscure game mode 
[20:42] <thatanonybear> @Sneaky_Vape LUL 

[20:42] <kekon3> Can you believe there have technically been over 20 CoDs now? 

[20:42] <vilky_p> female 

[20:42] <johngaltwho> That's unreal 

[20:42] <johngaltwho> That's a lot of games 

[20:42] <lvlpower> maybe the kids are playing it's the weekend 

[20:42] <zombiebeer> Phil have you accepted any challenges? you can unlock supply drops and get double xp 

and skins for weapons 

[20:42] <oneuglyrugby> its crazy 

[20:42] <vilky_p> same maps 



[20:42] <kekon3> shits stupid man, you don’t notice cause they stopped numbering them NotLikeThis 
[20:43] <timboslicegb> people vote for mapss 

[20:43] <kekon3> makes me feel old cause I started listing them last week 

[20:43] <nukacolaking> cheerlO I feel you man, for every great match I play-1 get 3 laggy, dropshot filled 
matches 

[20:43] <thatanonybear> @Kekon3 fav COD? 

[20:43] <hindae> Cant wait for CoD 2018 to be fututistic again lol 

[20:43] <johngaltwho> I remember when WaW came out. I worked at GameStop. Everybody called it Call of 
Duty 5. Like no bro. 

[20:43] <kekon3> CoD3, easy 

[20:43] <sneaky_vape> Stop the Germans Phil 

[20:43] <johngaltwho> 3? That's a unique choice 

[20:43] <cloudnoctis> Quadddd 

[20:43] <thatanonybear> @Kekon3 very esoteric 

[20:43] <thatanonybear> Kekon, international man of mytery and intrigue 
[20:44] <sneaky_vape> Lmao tank vs turret 

[20:44] <cheekyfries> Imagine if Activision gave 3x more budget to Treyarch and Treyarch made a Call of Duty 
once every 2 or 3 years and put more qa testing/programmers/artists/designers with the extra budget and time 
[20:44] <oneuglyrugby> Dark Syde Philburt 
[20:44] <cheekyfries> and if they cut off Slegdehammer/IW 

[20:44] <johngaltwho> Well to be fair there's usually a two to three year development cycle on each game 
[20:44] <thegreatempathizer> phil still using BAR? 

[20:45] <johngaltwho> With three studios they can spread the wealth around 

[20:45] <timboslicegb> 2018 is possible bo4 but sequal to bol not furture according to rumers 

[20:45] <grencial40> Why is he playing as an asian woman? How is that even possible? 

[20:45] <nukacolaking> On the plus side, I think this game has one of the better zombie modes in years 
[20:45] <talionshadowl 138> I’d personally like it if Treyarch went back to making Spiderman games 
[20:45] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho gr8 point, and tripling the budget wouldn't necessarily make for a 
better gae, they’d need 5-6 years 

[20:45] <deepdrive3254> theres several presets you can choose grencia 
[20:45] <johngaltwho> Why are there no swastikas? These are questions 
[20:45] <vilky_p> i spawn i die 

[20:45] <convertedclone> nah, he's locked on that corner. If you run in he's headshot you immediately 

[20:45] <talionshadowl 138> but did Activision lose the rights to the license? Since Insomniac is making the new 

Spiderman? 

[20:45] <cheekyfries> @Talionshadowl 138 That’d be a good idea! I loved Spiderman web of shadows 
[20:45] <kekon3> Historical Accuracy is controversial 
[20:45] <nightbot> Popcorn ass just tipped $2.00 

[20:45] <johngaltwho> I'm a Jew and I'm bothered but the lack of swastikas 

[20:45] <grencial40> but why is an asian woman one of them? What sense does that make? Its World War 2.... 
[20:45] <oneuglyrugby> @grencial40 Diversity bro 

[20:45] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho it's to sell the game in germany, they'd have to make a seperate 

non-swastika version for germany 

[20:45] <ccous666> this game sucks already? 

[20:45] <thatanonybear> or no swastikas period 

[20:45] <kekon3> and also swastikas are banned in germany, they probably removed it for germany, one single 
version of the game 

[20:45] <johngaltwho> I know they always made a separate version 
[20:45] <cheekyfries> Treyarch also made Spiderman 2 on the PS2 
[20:46] <lvlpower> too bad I'm gonna miss out the new Spider-Man game :( 

[20:46] <kekon3> It's cheaper to just make one version 
[20:46] <oneuglyrugby> Diversity is our strength 



[20:46] <thatanonybear> easy way out this year 

[20:46] <talionshadowl 138> Spider Man 2 for PS2 will always be my favourite 
[20:46] <thiccbwoii> is the new spiderman for pc? 

[20:46] <johngaltwho> I can still blame the liberals 
[20:46] <slowbrosif> hammer some logs together 
[20:46] <talionshadowl 138> @thiccbwoii PS4 exclusiiiiive 
[20:46] <slowbrosif> spider man 2 was based 

[20:46] <convertedclone> there are swastikas in the singleplayer strangely enough. I guess they don't want 

alt-righters to joke about it on voice chat 

[20:46] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho wau 

[20:46] <johngaltwho> Damn you liberals. Women aren't people. 

[20:46] <thegreatempathizer> Damn phil didn’t even lube those newbs up

[20:47] <thegreatempathizer> capturShrug 

[20:47] <talionshadowl 138> @thiccbwoii gay, yes, but what can you expect from Insomniac for being a Sony 
owned company :P 

[20:47] <samrlaseter> you are going to hurt all of the female DSP fans' feelings 

[20:47] <johngaltwho> People can do cool things like shoot guns and chew tobacco and lift weights. 

[20:47] <kushiyakitori> Insomniac is independent 
[20:47] <timboslicegb> ps4 ltb is 199 black friday im getting one 
[20:47] <johngaltwho> Let's see a woman do those things 
[20:47] <thatanonybear> @SamRLaseter Bobbi's not here ;) 

[20:47] <kekon3> Women are queens. 

[20:47] <vilky_p> they made all these maps in one week 
[20:47] <kekon3> Protect 

[20:47] <convertedclone> It is a little weird to be like "I'm on the Nazi team!", even if'axis powers' isn't much 
better 

[20:47] <thatanonybear> women are overrated 

[20:47] <oneuglyrugby> Damn Phil stays shit talkin Developers lolz 

[20:47] <thatanonybear> :P 

[20:47] <johngaltwho> I haven’t seen a woman in 7 years so I may be a bad opinion 
[20:47] <kozatof> @kekon3 traps are gay

[20:51] <johngaltwho> Xbox has a much better social and party system. 

[20:51] <convertedclone> it was someone else 
[20:51] <timboslicegb> true john 

[20:51] <johngaltwho> That's the only thing it has over the PlayStation at this point 

[20:51] <cheekyfries> Microsoft and Sony need to have better tech in their new consoles otherwise games are 
gonna stay nerfed for a long ass time 
[20:51] <thatanonybear> @Kekon3 DUDE 

[20:51] <thiccbwoii> gow4 has a decent multiplayer but the story mode was so fucking trash 

[20:51] <super_skyhawk_x_> XboxBlack XboxElite HappyJack 

[20:51] <lvlpower> do you think that players have the advantage with stats 

[20:51] <superslygaming> phils playing pretty good 

[20:51] <vilky_p> nerfed 

[20:51] <ccous666> mystery bullets PogChamp 

[20:51] <thiccbwoii> i really hope they make a good halo game for xbox 1 
[20:51] <johngaltwho> GoW2 was my favorite. So good. 

[20:51] <thegreatempathizer> k/d plummets 

[20:51] <talionshadowl 138> @thiccbwoii GOW4 was unnecessary imo 
[20:52] <vilky_p> gow4 syory is terrible 

[20:52] <talionshadowl 138> series ended so perfectly, but they had to retcon the Locust coming back 

[20:52] <johngaltwho> Although that original trailer with mad world was pretty awesome back in the day 

[20:52] <talionshadowl 138> just... why 

[20:52] <vilky_p> unnecessary true 

[20:52] <cookiemonster414> good job SeemsGood 

[20:52] <deepdrive3254> whew 

[20:52] <timboslicegb> xbox 1 x plays native 4k games its future proof

[20:52] <thiccbwoii> gears of war 1 Kreygasm 

[20:52] <talionshadowl 138> @JohnGaltWho that was my childhood right there XD. Was like... 10 years old 
[20:52] <cheekyfries> Hey DSP put on the mic and talk shit to people, it'd be entertaining. 

[20:52] <huffysan> We did it. 

[20:52] <thegreatempathizer> AA 

[20:52] <ccous666> well done son 

[20:52] <oneuglyrugby> Phil actually isnt that bad at Cod 

[20:52] <popsicolo> Someone worked hard to build that bridge. TearGlove 

[20:53] <vilky_p> and the goverment turned on the cog 

[20:53] <johngaltwho> Lol I was a fair bit older but I spent a lot of time in horde mode 
[20:53] <patrickcl0> That would be hilarious 
[20:53] <kozatof> Show deaths 

[20:53] <thiccbwoii> i might get that remake of gowl it looka kind of good 

[20:53] <patrickcl0> Phil is good at COD when he stops bitching and focuses. He actually can be good 

[20:53] <lvlpower> players on mic 

[20:53] <vilky_p> remake is good 

[20:53] <thiccbwoii> if theres still ppl playing it that is 

[20:53] <johngaltwho> Gears of War ultimate is good. Worth it if you can pick it up cheap 
[20:53] <sultan488> @oneuglyrugby havena€™t u heard his i spwan i die song 
[20:53] <kozatof> Wonder what the kd looks like 

[20:53] <talionshadowl 138> @patrickcl0 same could be said for any other player really 

[20:53] <thiccbwoii> @johngaltwho ya i might 

[20:53] <patrickcl0> Absolutely @thiccbwoii 

[20:53] <vilky_p> prepare to wall bounce in gears 

[20:54] <oneuglyrugby> @sultan488 of course, its a classic 



[20:54] <johngaltwho> Haha wall bouncing. Took me forever to catch on 
[20:54] <ccous666> gow 1 online was the greatest 
[20:54] <thiccbwoii> tried the destiny 2 beta it was mehh 

[20:54] <samrlaseter> well Phil's gameplay has settled this for me: not buying this piece of crap game 
[20:54] <bootytease> i was in another stream who asked to sub emotes i posted a dsp pne and they roasted me 
[20:54] <bootytease> to see* 

[20:54] <johngaltwho> Destiny 2 is a good game. But it isn't spectacular by any measure 

[20:54] <oneuglyrugby> but he was on Rust, thats a spawn and die map 

[20:54] <thatanonybear> @BootyTease you were cyberbullied dspDeath 

[20:54] <thiccbwoii> yea gow 1 online soo fuking good 

[20:54] <kekon3> Rip bootyTease, you got bodied 

[20:54] <johngaltwho> That battleship map is terrible for spawning. 

[20:54] <thatanonybear> BOO HOO 

[20:55] <kekon3> kekon3CBHar kekon3CBHar kekon3CBHar 

[20:55] <nukacolaking> cheerlO Take heart bcause the zombies mode is pretty great imo 

[20:55] <cheekyfries> @JohnGaltWho I'm triggered at that game cause it didn't learn anything from Destiny l's 

second and third year 

[20:55] <vilky_p> next gen gaming here 

[20:55] <huffysan> A blocked by the Sonic. 

[20:55] <bootytease> @ThatAnonyBear @Kekon3 dsp has a bad rep i had no clue 
[20:55] <thatanonybear> LUL 
[20:55] <kozatof> Kekk 

[20:55] <johngaltwho> @cheekyfries the guy I game share with bought it otherwise I wouldn’t have touched it 
[20:55] <ijawd> The spans in this game are complete trash 
[20:55] <ccous666> PowerUpR BabyRage PowerUpR BibleThump 
[20:55] <ijawd> spawns 

[20:55] <kekon3> you gotta learn that stuff, but it okay 
[20:55] <popsicolo> popsicSmug popsicSmug popsicSmug 
[20:55] <mxavier91> whats wrong with the game 
[20:56] <bootytease> @mxavier91 dropped inputs 

[20:56] <thiccbwoii> im not getting this fucking game though, i mught give the division another go once update 
1.8 hits 

[20:56] <ijawd> I legit spawned right behind an enemy just a sec ago 
[20:56] <huffysan> @mxavier91 It was made by Sledghehammer. 

[20:56] <crownstadtl7> Can I team up with y'all 

[20:56] <johngaltwho> Sledgehammer came out and said this is their greatest work ever 
[20:56] <thatanonybear> @FlyEaglesFly01 hey fam tsosWave 
[20:56] <johngaltwho> Their magnum opus basically 
[20:57] <lvlpower> fuel 

[20:57] <thiccbwoii> the division survival die is reallly fun also 
[20:57] <cheekyfries> 1-2 times tbh 

[20:57] <flyeaglesfly01> @ThatAnonyBear n28HeyGuys n28HeyGuys 
[20:57] <oneuglyrugby> @johngaltwho thats prolly true but thats not realy sayin much 
[20:57] <deepdrive3254> KonCha flyeaglesfly 
[20:58] <johngaltwho> @oneuglyrugby lrnao true that 

[20:58] <timboslicegb> this game is not bad i have played every cod since cod 1 pc at launce i have seen worse 
[20:58] <oneuglyrugby> i like this game tho 
[20:58] <johngaltwho> I like it too. 

[20:58] <johngaltwho> It is a pain in the dick like every other call of duty 
[20:58] <cheekyfries> dsp why do you seem so angry at this game 
[20:58] <johngaltwho> Some games bring out the salt more than others 

[20:58] <cloudnoctis> You just need to have better aim. Aside from the his delay yadayadayada, it comes to to 



your aim, and hitting your shots 

[20:59] <talionshadowl 138> damn that was a good molotov throw 

[20:59] <oneuglyrugby> The more futuristic a Cod is, the less I like it generally 

[20:59] <johngaltwho> I liked infinite warfare. Good campaign. 

[20:59] <huffysan> @Oneuglyrugby So prehistoric COD is the best? 

[20:59] <pistasheo> Is this game still broken? 

[20:59] <nukacolaking> IMO Infinite warfare had a great campaign, terrible mp and good zombies 

[20:59] <johngaltwho> Nah they're fixing it slowly 

[21:00] <cheekyfries> Next year's CoD = American Revolution 

[21:00] <cloudnoctis> Sounds good to me. Ride dinosaurs, use bones as melee, and rocks as ranged weaponry 

[21:00] <johngaltwho> Agreed @nukacolaking multiplayer was trash but zombies was excellent 

[21:00] <cheekyfries> Actually, I wouldn't mind a Call of Duty: Wild West 

[21:00] <oneuglyrugby> @huffysan Bro, 2000 B.C. Cod would be godlike 

[21:00] <johngaltwho> Well we have Red Dead 2 coming 

[21:00] <pistasheo> Zombies in IW was way fun!! I hardly touche MP 

[21:00] <johngaltwho> Although I guarantee it'll be delayed 

[21:00] <cheekyfries> Yeah there is rdr2

[21:01] <thiccbwoii> thrrws already a game like that its called far cry primal 

[21:01] <thatanonybear> @mxavier91 audio/visual indicators 

[21:01] <johngaltwho> A surprisingly good game was far cry primal 

[21:01] <oneuglyrugby> WaW is still my fav 

[21:01] <cloudnoctis> whooot 

[21:01] <timboslicegb> you guys would bash a wild west cod because its cod 
[21:01] <cookiemonster414> SeemsGood 
[21:01] <mxavier91> That's mutant level abilty 
[21:01] <thiccbwoii> does fc primal have multiplayer? 

[21:01] <kozatof> @oneuglyrugby righhht ppsh op 
[21:01] <patrickcl0> good game phil 
[21:01] <kozatof> Never fixed if 

[21:01] <oneuglyrugby> followed by the first like 6 months of MW2 

[21:01] <cheekyfries> @timboslicegb everyone would cause nobody takes cod seriously 

[21:01] <huffysan> Applause. 

[21:01] <sirnoblex> Congratz @FlyBeast 

[21:01] <sirnoblex> Should get mine in a few months. 

[21:02] <thatanonybear> KILLL CONFIRMED 

[21:02] <johngaltwho> Lol the random 

[21:02] <kozatof> @oneuglyrugby never fixed mp40 either 

[21:02] <flybeast> hello everyone! 

[21:02] <cheekyfries> supply drop opening lets do it dsp 
[21:02] <patrickcl0> phil map vote with L2 operation breakout 
[21:02] <deepdrive3254> KonCha flybeast 
[21:02] <timboslicegb> lol 

[21:02] <oneuglyrugby> @kozatof The mp40 was the only real problem 
[21:02] <thiccbwoii> LOL 

[21:02] <jack_spartacus> @You should upgrade your pistol from the P08 to 1911. 

[21:02] <sirnoblex> Hahaha 

[21:03] <kozatof> But the ppsh fired faster 

[21:03] <thiccbwoii> and its nothing 



[21:03] <oneuglyrugby> youll never have perfect balance, and u wouldnt want it either 

[21:03] <lvlpower> hype for the beta map 

[21:03] <kozatof> @oneuglyrugby huh why not 

[21:03] <oneuglyrugby> think pong, gets boring quick imo 

[21:03] <huffysan> @kozatof Ppsh in first COD MP is godlike. 

[21:04] <pistasheo> come on that's hardly a german accent 

[21:04] <cheekyfries> @Oneuglyrugby Destiny 2 tried to do perfect balance and its a shit game because of it 

[21:04] <oneuglyrugby> thise random mp40 hip fire steady aim headshots tho 

[21:05] <thiccbwoii> destiny 2 pissed me off looks like way too much fucking grinding for stuff 

[21:05] <johngaltwho> Balance is a very difficult topic in games 

[21:05] <thiccbwoii> some ppl like that though 

[21:05] <huffysan> Do people use shotgun a lot? 

[21:05] <ccous666> PowerUpR BibleThump 

[21:05] <deepdrive3254> balance or not you want the game to be fair 

[21:05] <johngaltwho> I don’t get grinding either. But then again I can't stand playing WoW 

[21:05] <thiccbwoii> so mnay weapons which is nice but very ocd 

[21:05] <oneuglyrugby> @cheekyfries never played Destiny, dont like PvE grinding shiite 

[21:05] <cheekyfries> I did the raid in destiny 2 four times and got nothing the first time, and the rest of the 

times I just got duplicate drops 

[21:06] <timboslicegb> destiny francise big let down for me they made amazing halo games 

[21:06] <johngaltwho> Destiny makes me want to go play Halo 3 with my buddies 

[21:06] <cheekyfries> Destiny l's grind was fun, because the rewards were good, and dropped after each 

encounter of the raids. It was very good in its third year but only after all of its dies fixed it 

[21:06] <thiccbwoii> halo 3 was so much fun back in the daya 

[21:06] <deepdrive3254> phil thats just what you did though 

[21:07] <johngaltwho> My favorite of the series hands down 

[21:07] <samrlaseter> I hate when Phil is a nazi 

[21:07] <samrlaseter> it makes me feel sad 

[21:07] <oneuglyrugby> @deepdrive3254 Yes. Fairness, u dont wanna feel like u had no chance 

[21:07] <timboslicegb> halo 3 is still fun 

[21:07] <convertedclone> Phil’s always put on the shittier team 

[21:07] <super_skyhawk_x_> phil unlocks unlimited PJSalt Kappa 

[21:07] <thiccbwoii> yea halo 3 is my fav too i liked reach too though 

[21:07] <johngaltwho> Fairness and balance are sort of different aren’t they? 

[21:07] <convertedclone> ... 

[21:07] <wholetruthbruce> ... 

[21:07] <cheekyfries> ... 

[21:08] <raganorkl0> look at the structure in the broken parts of the wall; it's wood 

[21:08] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil i think FMJ is the ability to shoot through walls. 

[21:08] <cheekyfries> Oh my gawd dood, i slipped over the wood and died, stoopid developers 
[21:08] <tengu_stoner> Every death is something 
[21:08] <johngaltwho> Poorly made!!, 

[21:08] <deepdrive3254> yeah you can have imbalances like someone being a sniper and someone else having 
infantry weapons is an imbalance 
[21:08] <oneuglyrugby> froze? 

[21:08] <huffysan> Amature night. 

[21:08] <ccous666> BabyRage BibleThump PowerUpR BabyRage 
[21:08] <deepdrive3254> just as an example 

[21:08] <j_pepe> So it sounds like Phil is not liking the multiplayer? 

[21:08] <johngaltwho> Starcraft is what I think of when I think of balance 
[21:09] <cheekyfries> phil, play tetris instead :D 
[21:09] <johngaltwho> Tetris is no joke 



[21:09] <deepdrive3254> i remember when phil played tetris 

[21:09] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho i think of RUssian Gymnasts 

[21:09] <lvlpower> show me how to Tetris 

[21:09] <johngaltwho> @thatanonybear well now that you said it 

[21:09] <thatanonybear> TETRIS dspDeath 

[21:09] <convertedclone> He says the multiplayer is alright, but he hates a lot about it 
[21:09] <hindae> Almost out of ammo Phil 
[21:09] <oneuglyrugby> Tetris was invented by Communists 
[21:10] <cheekyfries> lul 

[21:10] <huffysan> Phil is competetive tetris player 

[21:10] <timboslicegb> letss be honest most of cod coding is in all cods including anamation cod needs a new 
ingine its not just sledge hammer 
[21:10] <huffysan> competitive" 

[21:10] <zombiebeer> how can you hammer and nail when machine guns are firing at you! 

[21:10] <johngaltwho> And people say communism didn't bring us anything 

[21:10] <oneuglyrugby> perhaps the only thing ever invented by Communists

[21:12] <kekon3> flamethrower dying is fucked up 

[21:13] <thiccbwoii> @hindae well...then lawbreakers is the perfect game for phil

[21:15] <smackhammerl> can’t believe you're still using the BAR lol 

[21:15] <kinggoken> cause he needed it. Baron Corbin is extremely bland on the mic and in the ring. 
@JohnGaltWho 

[21:15] <cheekyfries> yeah tbh this gun kinda seems boring 
[21:15] <ccous666> Kreygasm 

[21:15] <thiccbwoii> bcuz baron koras is a bad asa niguh 
[21:16] <thiccbwoii> thats y 

[21:16] <oneuglyragby> Phil does this in every Cod 

[21:16] <johngaltwho> @kinggoken I miss his days of squash matches on NXT 
[21:16] <thatanonybear> this is a Baron Corbin gun, it's BORING 
[21:16] <cheekyfries> lul 

[21:16] <hindae> Doesnt feel beefy like it used to, that BAR. STG is likely way better 

[21:16] <oneuglyragby> pick one gun and use it forever 

[21:16] <kinggoken> lrnao i forgot about those squash matches 

[21:16] <thiccbwoii> LUL 

[21:16] <smackhammerl> bring back mp40 scum 

[21:16] <yolodopper> cheer 10 so is it really better than all of the modern warfare games? 

[21:17] <smackhammerl> remember how op the ppsh was in cod 5? 

[21:17] <thiccbwoii> lmao smoke grenades 

[21:17] <oneuglyragby> WaW BAR dropped fools @hindae 

[21:17] <flybeast> dspFun 

[21:17] <hindae> It did indeed, fucking brutal rifle. 20 rounds of pain 
[21:17] <cheekyfries> that smoke grenade has a super small radius 
[21:18] <thatanonybear> COD 2 smoke grenades were OP 
[21:18] <cheekyfries> hammer the ground! 

[21:18] <cloudnoctis> lol

[21:18] <ccous666> LUL 

[21:19] <thiccbwoii> starting smoking again :( 

[21:19] <smackhammerl> cut down 

[21:19] <hindae> Kudos for actually playing the objective unlike about 90% of CoD players 
[21:19] <thiccbwoii> ya i know 

[21:19] <johngaltwho> Everybody treats objective matches like team death match. So frustrating. 

[21:19] <thiccbwoii> what a deviously addictive shit 
[21:19] <smackhammerl> No one has smoke equip prolly 
[21:20] <hindae> Huh, well done 

[21:20] <cheekyfries> @JohnGaltWho actually i think in this scenario, more ppl should've been killing the 
defenders 

[21:20] <cookiemonster414> nice SeemsGood 

[21:20] <johngaltwho> @cheekyfries it's really hard to take out the defenders from that position. They have all 
the advantages 

[21:20] <smackhammerl> this is cod. No one plays objectives kappa 

[21:20] <johngaltwho> Two big buildings with upper stories and Windows 

[21:20] <hindae> LOL that death tho 

[21:21] <vilky_p> phil is all happy now 

[21:21] <cheekyfries> true 

[21:21] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho shoot the windows :P 

[21:21] <oneuglyrugby> @johngaltwho to be fair, killstreaks really help in capping objectives 
[21:21] <thiccbwoii> lol 

[21:21] <johngaltwho> True. If only I was good enough to earn kill streaks 
[21:21] <smackhammerl> nice 

[21:21] <hindae> CoD is better when you stop taking it seriously in any way. 

[21:21] <thatanonybear> TALENT PREVAILS 

[21:21] <cheekyfries> gg 

[21:21] <cookiemonster414> nice nice.. 

[21:21] <thiccbwoii> cod is like arcade style fps 

[21:22] <smackhammerl> this team is so mad lol 

[21:22] <hindae> Someone just got ran over or some shit 

[21:22] <thiccbwoii> bf 1 is more realish i guess 

[21:22] <johngaltwho> They were on fire I believe 

[21:22] <oneuglyrugby> ideally you would have 2 people trying to get streaks, and the rest fighting for the 
objective i think 

[21:22] <thiccbwoii> oooo nice box breaking physics 
[21:23] <smackhammerl> is the flamethrower op in this game? 

[21:23] <johngaltwho> I’d rely on the snipers to earn the streaks 

[21:23] <cheekyfries> sure sledgehammer 

[21:23] <johngaltwho> Since they typically should die less 

[21:23] <thatanonybear> @JohnGaltWho would you rely on DSP as your sniper? 

[21:23] <thatanonybear> answer wisely 
[21:23] <cheekyfries> lul 
[21:23] <twilisparks> dood 

[21:23] <johngaltwho> @thatanonybear I'll be his spotter any day

[21:23] <vilky_p> Would you rather watch phil play this or player unknown? 

[21:24] <timboslicegb> phil is nott a sniper

[21:27] <oneuglyrugby> SWITCH GUNS TOO 

[21:27] <johngaltwho> IW got shitty after the two main dudes left 

[21:27] <johngaltwho> To go make titanfall 

[21:27] <neospartanhesperos9> Is there a reason why phil wanted to play COD there days in a row only, or does 
he just want to 

[21:27] <hindae> and Titanfall is just good, shame it died so fast though

[21:27] <oneuglyrugby> @johngaltwho goddamn shame 

[21:27] <timboslicegb> if not for sledge hammer mw3 would not been made 

[21:27] <kinggoken> Titanfall ended up being kind of meh...in my opinion 

[21:27] <johngaltwho> Well thry got fucked by activision 

[21:28] <cheekyfries> Fuck it. do it 

[21:28] <thatanonybear> PRESTIGE 

[21:28] <hindae> TF2 is amazing though, except for all the unbalanced weapons its a fantastic game 
[21:28] <oneuglyrugby> Never had more fun in a video game than in the early days of MW2 
[21:28] <cheekyfries> Dsp you a chick 

[21:28] <johngaltwho> MW2 was so good online. Despite the constant glitches 

[21:28] <cheekyfries> in the game i mean 

[21:28] <timboslicegb> most of iw devs left before mw3 

[21:29] <oneuglyrugby> Even the glitches were fun lol 

[21:29] <neospartanhesperos9> the SVT PogChamp 

[21:29] <timboslicegb> sledgehammer saved mw3 from being dropped 



[21:29] <smackhammerl> do you fight the Japanese in this game? all I’ve seen is krauts 

[21:29] <hindae> Because reskinning the same engine year after year to sate Activisions money hunger is boring 

as fuck to a real game Dev 

[21:29] <johngaltwho> Lol care package glitch 

[21:29] <oneuglyrugby> The Javelin glitch was hilarious 

[21:29] <kevingunn3r> Its all about battlefield these days when it comes to best FPS 
[21:29] <oneuglyrugby> The rock glitch 

[21:29] <johngaltwho> Eh. After battlefield 4 they lost a lot of reputation 
[21:30] <timboslicegb> bfl was not great 

[21:30] <gamemaster8814> @DarksydePhil it's a singe shot but it kills in 2 hits with anything above the hip. 

[21:30] <hindae> Meh, BF1 seemed kinda shitty to me, i played the campaign and immediately got bored 

[21:30] <oneuglyrugby> its was a goddamn race everytime to get in the rock 

[21:30] <johngaltwho> They should stop tucking around and make bad company 3 already 

[21:30] <timboslicegb> bf4 was last good bf game 

[21:30] <popsicolo> Uss [Alexis] Texas 

[21:30] <kinggoken> lol i was just thinking about bad company 2

[22:26] <gamemaster8814> I think its safe to say @DarksydePhil hates this game lol 

[22:26] <torglel 1> if its not super turbo, he hates it 

[22:27] <thiccbwoii> BlessRNG 

[22:27] <kushiyakitori> why he’d check something out for an explanation? to see the explanation lol 
[22:27] <darkmagicianl82> He's gonna complain the gun shoots too fast and runs out of ammo too fast. Rapid 
Fire on a 20 round AR 

[22:27] <johngaltwho> He likes shadow of war 
[22:27] <darkmagicianl82> 5-12

[22:32] <neospartanhesperos9> is it halo like 

[22:32] <cheekyfries> it can be fun if you like its gameplay style 

[22:32] <neospartanhesperos9> with vehicles 

[22:33] <kekon3> i'm more excited for the backwards compatibility tbh 
[22:33] <johngaltwho> It feels like halo cause bungie made it 
[22:33] <timboslicegb> xbox x is moree powerfulll then ps4 pro fact 
[22:33] <toast559> did he play wolfenstein? 

[22:33] <paddingtonbearl87> id rather buy the ps4 pro its 100 cheaper and playstations got great 3rd party 
support :D 

[22:33] <thiccbwoii> xbox one x is gd if u have a 4k tv 

[22:33] <cheekyfries> yeah it feels like halo but it has pretty small maps and 4v4 and no vehicles 

[22:33] <toast559> fuck 4k

[22:54] <crbandicOot> Of course shotgun wins close quarters, no shit 
[22:54] <johngaltwho> WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN MASOn!?!? 

[22:54] <nightbot> JohnGaltWho -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[22:54] <cheekyfries> mw4 would be interesting 

[22:55] <declan_reed> This game looks like it drops a lot of frames depending on the gun being used. 

[22:55] <superslygaming> 1 more game 
[22:55] <toast559> not OG iw 

[22:55] <carvercity96> If you had better internet on that kill, how would he not have killed you?

[22:55] <ijawd> KappaPride 

[22:55] <toast559> fuck black ops 

[22:55] <thekinginyellOw> damn, is there a single streamer who's actually enjoying this game? everyone I tune 
into is frustrated af 
[22:56] <ijawd> PJSalt 

[22:56] <sgt_blackjack> @TXstormSURGE it must be their fault it must be their fault it must be their fault 
SMOrc 

[22:56] <kekon3> is that true @TheKinginYellOw ? thats fucked 
[22:56] <ccous666> negative edge 

[22:56] <cheekyfries> @thesupervillain543 where dat sandwich at? Kappa 
[22:56] <zahvone> @TheKinginYellOw A lot of it is the awful launch. 

[22:56] <toast559> connection was actually better in 2000 

[22:56] <kekon3> I'm probably gonna try the game tonight and see for myself 

[22:56] <superslygaming> i only play cod for the lore 

[22:56] <zahvone> @TheKinginYellOw Another portion of it, is because of how bad the base engine is, STILL. 

[22:57] <johngaltwho> Dedicated servers. It's cause of peer to peer servers 

[22:57] <timboslicegb> correct phil 

[22:57] <kittyspank> bufferbloat 

[22:57] <toast559> Quake 3 engine. 

[22:57] <zahvone> Right now we're using peer2peer servers instead of the dedicated ones, because of the bad 
launch. 

[22:57] <kittyspank> internet was less latent back in the day 




[22:57] <kekon3> hey phil, down to play some unreal tournament? Kappa 
[22:57] <kevingunn3r> im finishing the campaign after this 
[22:57] <johngaltwho> COD always uses P2P don't they? 

[22:57] <superslygaming> 1 more 

[22:57] <timboslicegb> base engine is same since cod4 

[22:57] <n3shy> why rewrite code when people will buy it anyway? 

[22:57] <thekinginyellOw> nice dome shot 

[22:57] <toast559> its not actually dedicated servers tho 

[22:57] <cheekyfries> @Kekon3 lets do it, next patron goal, unreal tournament 99 and 04 with fans Kappa 

[22:57] <pikatits> danLol danLUL 

[22:57] <icedcoffee019> omg lol 

[22:58] <superslygaming> another 1 

[22:58] <kittyspank> hahaha 

[22:58] <johngaltwho> Peer2Peee isn’t dedicated. Quite the opposite 
[22:58] <toast559> dedicated host, game is still p2p 
[22:58] <zahvone> the game does have dedicated servers 

[22:58] <declan_reed> I understand that's also an issue. I'm saying that it seems that some guns are causing 
future input lag due to their animation. More appropriately I suppose I should say that since they didn’t normalize 
the frame data for firing animations, some weapons suffer from a discrepancy between the intended firing rate 
and the actual rate being achieved. 

[22:58] <zahvone> But right now it's p2p because of the launch. 

[22:58] <carvercity96> You had better internet than him 
[22:58] <timboslicegb> cod is still p2p only stats is server based 
[22:58] <kekon3> @Declan_Reed is this data? can I read this? 

[22:58] <johngaltwho> Too bad only six people play call of duty on PC 
[22:58] <kekon3> That sounds like a hella interesting problem 
[22:59] <ltpenguin22> that reaction time 

[22:59] <zahvone> @Declan_Reed It's also that, but the animations are biased toward clientside and not server, 
right? That's why killcams are always different 

[22:59] <jurassictunga> how are these legitimate kills now and not the last 4 matches? 

[22:59] <declan_reed> @Kekon3 I can’t remember where I read about it; it seemed to be datamined information 
regarding weapons of the same type. 

[22:59] <zahvone> Server is looking to register the bullet damage etc, but not the animations lol 

[22:59] <kekon3> then its probably up on reddit somewhere, thanks tho that sounds like an interesting read 

[23:00] <ijawd> we just turned back an hour 

[23:00] <convertedclone> LUL 

[23:00] <n3shy> never did like the perks in cod 

[23:00] <ijawd> its lam now 

[23:00] <johngaltwho> Fucking yay. Another hour of work 

[23:00] <kekon3> failure of game design is such an interesting topic, I'm always interested in learning how 
things tick 

[23:00] <declan_reed> I could understand it being an intended consequence amongst guns of the same type if 
there's also a discrepancy in the inherent amount of damage caused without modifications. 

[23:00] <cheekyfries> phil should start doing drunk streams 
[23:00] <declan_reed> But I don't know if that's the case. 

[23:01] <superslygaming> so hows phil liking the game? 

[23:01] <carvercity96> You missed 

[23:01] <cheekyfries> imagine this much salt but while drunk 
[23:01] <cheekyfries> that'd be amazing 

[23:01] <convertedclone> these aren't drunk streams already? :o 
[23:01] <johngaltwho> Phil is drunk on every stream I thought 
[23:01] <timboslicegb> omg i just went back in time Kappa 



[23:01] <sgt_blackjack> maybe CoD needs to do what AC did - take a break of a year so everyone of the 3 
studios gets more time to develope the game 5Yn” 

[23:01] <ijawd> Sledgehammer sucks X500 
[23:01] <cheekyfries> lol xD

[23:02] <sgt_blackjack> @JohnGaltWho maybe they need more maybe they are lazy or have difficulties at their 
job i dunno LUL 

[23:02] <carvercity96> not one legitimate death 

[23:02] <thekinginyell0w> it spawned him behind you, this game really should have been boycotted 
[23:02] <johngaltwho> If I did my job badly I’d get fired. Idk.
