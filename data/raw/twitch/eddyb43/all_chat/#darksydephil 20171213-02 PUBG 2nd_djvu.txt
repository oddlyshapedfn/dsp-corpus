[19:47] <chairmancaleb> @KingOfHypocrisy Can't say that I'm surprised in all honesty. 
[19:47] <assassinaltair7> Phil play assassins creed rogue 
[19:47] <bobdole332> wheres phil

[19:47] <paddingtonbearl87> AHHH praiiiise InuyoFace 

[19:47] <kingofhypocrisy> @ChainnanCaleb well he said he's getting divorced, not divorced yet but yeah 
[19:48] <smackhammerl> why am i TOXIC? 

[19:48] <rocthaice24> Lol this wcw music playing 
[19:48] <damntobi> DETOX 

[19:48] <bobdole332> yo @paddingtonBEAR187 whaddup 

[19:48] <mxavier91> They need to take a break from making the WWE2K games 

[19:48] <chairmancaleb> @KingOfHypocrisy Divorcing takes a while to finalize, but yeah, I'm not surprised if 
finally happening. 

[19:48] <assassinaltair7> WHAT IS R!!!?? Yesterdaya€™s stream was hilarious 
[19:48] <paddingtonbearl87> @bobdole332 sup buddy good to see ya 
[19:48] <thatanonyraccoon> They need to lose the WWE license 
[19:48] <sleepyreader> i really hope kh3 comes out in 2018 
[19:48] <smackhammerl> i get timed for that lol 
[19:48] <bobdole332> at least someone is 

[19:48] <rocthaice24> Need a new company making them the effort on my career was disgraceful 
[19:49] <sleepyreader> also that phil does a playthrough of birth by sleep or dream drop distance 
[19:49] <chairmancaleb> He won’t Sleepy. 

[19:49] <mxavier91> IMO the WWE games need to put more focus on the Story modes rather than the Career 
Mode 

[19:49] <bobdole332> he should replay bloodborne 

[19:49] <rocthaice24> One storyline and ita€™s not even voiced 

[19:49] <chairmancaleb> Phil really shouldn't touch KH3 in my opinion, he won't know what the fuck is going 
on. 

[19:49] <damntobi> but why tho 
[19:49] <smackhammerl> he will soon 

[19:49] <kaixp> Ita€™s not relevant enough to be played by him 

[19:49] <assassinaltair7> Phil is replaying bloodborne next year 

[19:49] <mxavier91> wait they're still making KH3 

[19:49] <bobdole332> ok good 

[19:49] <kingofhypocrisy> big throbbing dickhead 

[19:49] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @sleepyreader fall 2018 

[19:50] <kingofhypocrisy> dick lightning 

[19:50] <seansmegghead> i would've loved a Bloodborne run for crimbo 
[19:50] <assassinaltair7> Very christmasy 
[19:50] <rocthaice24> Worse game 

[19:50] <smackhammerl> did he fight moon presence on original bloodborne? 

[19:50] <damntobi> mass effect 2 or 3 replay 
[19:50] <elite878> Lmao 
[19:51] <assassinaltair7> Yes he did 
[19:51] <lvlpower> lol 

[19:51] <kaixp> Dona€™t see the point in replaying games imo 

[19:51] <paddingtonbearl87> imagine if you got a stuffed toy and it sang this InuyoFace 
[19:51] <rocthaice24> Dick lighting 

[19:51] <bobdole332> bloodborne is the greatest also hopefully i dont end up on a detractor vid 
[19:51] <assassinaltair7> Kai youa€™re a casual thata€™s why 
[19:51] <smackhammerl> lol 

[19:51] <assassinaltair7> Bloodborne is the best game in the world 

[19:51] <seansmegghead> i just want to see him go against Ludwig... and Kos

[20:07] <paddingtonbearl87> drop in the water maybe theres loot there InuyoFace 

[20:07] <bentboxer> phils background feels like downtown usa Christmas decoration 

[20:07] <extracheeez> it's just mind-blowing they released this on console in this state 

[20:07] <damntobi> nice slideshow 

[20:07] <mxavier91> OMG those Frames

[20:07] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> is this game on the ps3 

[20:08] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil I just can’t get over the production values of this game! dspWowdude 
[20:08] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> my dogshit PC from 2011 runs PUBG better than an xbox one...holy fuck 
this is bad 

[20:08] <solid_fantasy> Watch someone twist what Phil said into "fuck you I don’t appreciate tips"

[20:08] <paddingtonbearl87> ew that POP IN ms kk F mskkF mskkF 

[20:08] <aiursrage2k> hahha 

[20:08] <coralguy> lol 

[20:08] <amisbro> Thar be some pop in 

[20:08] <popsicolo> Someone coated the buildings in vaseline. 

[20:08] <assassinaltair7> Current state of gaming everyone 

[20:09] <paddingtonbearl87> the buildings are like MELTED candles 

[20:09] <mxavier91> Whoever ported this game should be ashamed of themselves 

[20:09] <georgetdawson> has he been enjoying or hating the game? 

[20:09] <popsicolo> Yes. 

[20:09] <chairmancaleb> I guess Crow's video was spot on with the pop ins. 

[20:09] <aiursrage2k> oh its on xbox 
[20:09] <chairmancaleb> That’s tumble. 

[20:09] <mickjones90> this game has worse pop in than most n64 games but I think it's pretty fun 

[20:09] <datoneguyweallknow> He hates it @georgetdawson 

[20:09] <xboxl_is_garbage> Was this game made in like 1990 or something? 

[20:09] <tcbeastmode> What kind of Xbox is Phil playing this on 
[20:09] <paddingtonbearl87> @xboxl_is_garbage LUL 
[20:09] <damntobi> textures should be way lower 

[20:10] <paddingtonbearl87> @xboxl_is_garbage i take it youre not a fan of the xbox? InuyoFace 
[20:10] <kingofhypocrisy> @TcBeastMode the dust one 
[20:10] <bobdole332> you guys r noovs 

[20:10] <amisbro> PUBG otherwise known as the "Best Insomnia Cure of 2017" 

[20:10] <chairmancaleb> @Xboxl_is_garbage Oh, the irony of your name LUL 
[20:10] <elite878> It’s indie developers hence the optimisation and 1990 look lol 
[20:10] <georgetdawson> @DatoneGuyWeAllknow are you kidding or being serious? 

[20:10] <assassinaltair7> I wish this was 720p 60fps instead of 1080p 30fps 



[20:10] <seansmegghead> so slow and clumbsy compared to pc 

[20:10] <extracheeez> is there any chance he has the graphics settings turned low? is that even a thing on 
console?

[20:10] <aiursrage2k> waste of space 

[20:10] <datoneguyweallknow> @georgetdawson serious if you were on stream earlier he really got pissed at it 

[20:10] <solid_fantasy> There are N64 games that look better than this 

[20:10] <thatanonyraccoon> @georgetdawson don’t take him at face value 

[20:10] <paddingtonbearl87> @assassinaltair7 480p 60fps would be acceptable compared to this 

[20:10] <bobdole332> this chat is a waste of space 

[20:11] <hilhnan811> They're not indie anymore, they've made boat loads of money off this shit, time to make 
the product look like it. 

[20:11] <kingofhypocrisy> then leave 

[20:11] <forcexkin> Super mario sunshine next? 

[20:11] <solid_fantasy> Graphics don’t make a game but this is hideous 

[20:11] <damntobi> n64 doesnt need render 

[20:11] <aiursrage2k> play mario sunshine 

[20:11] <bobdole332> you first i saw the vid you were in 

[20:11] <thatanonyraccoon> @KingOfHypocrisy dude's a troll, he just begged someone to gift him a sub 
[20:11] <elite878> @hilhnan811 I doubt they'd bother they've made a fortune so there's no need 
[20:11] <momimomi> CAHMAHWN DOOD 

[20:11] <paddingtonbearl87> @solid_fantasy frame rate makes a game though InuyoFace 

[20:11] <magicjerryfresh 11> Phil do you excuse the game at all cause it says early access all over it? Or do you 

think it isna€™t even in that state? 

[20:11] <aiursrage2k> ugh 

[20:11] <kingofhypocrisy> @Bobdole332 i don't make videos,what are u talking about 

[20:12] <cte900> since when did BTTV change the split chat to black and white when in dark mode? this looks 
awful i can't even read half the chat. 

[20:12] <xboxl_is_garbage> Dice should make a game like this with the frostbite engine. It would look so damn 
good. 

[20:12] <damntobi> early acces shitty excuse for pc games 8 yrs in the making 
[20:12] <solid_fantasy> It's the pop-in that annoys me most 

[20:12] <amisbro> alright serious question: What is the actual POINT of this game? 

[20:12] <chairmancaleb> @Magicjerryfresh 11 Someone said last stream that this game is officially releasing on 
the 20th, so that's a little....peculiar imo. 

[20:12] <bobdole332> no the video where you got called out by phil 
[20:12] <emryl> This game looked a lot better on my phone earlier... 

[20:12] <aiursrage2k> to drink some beer 

[20:12] <deepdrive3254> i guess to be the last one standing amisbro 

[20:12] <elite878> @amisbro to survive to the end. Like 100 players and last man standing basically 
[20:12] <deepdrive3254> its not supposed to be fun though 
[20:12] <deepdrive3254> LOL 

[20:12] <forcexkin> yeah its called escape from tarkov 
[20:12] <bobdole332> i am not a troll 

[20:12] <hilhnan811> EA would make this game pay to win so fuckin quick... 

[20:12] <imaidenr> now its easy win 

[20:12] <datoneguyweallknow> think of hunger games meets cod 
[20:13] <concretecasket> haha 

[20:13] <seansmegghead> phil getting monster hunter? 



[20:13] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil This flooded town reminds me of Pittsburgh in The Last of Us, 
except that game had good graphics whereas this game looks like an early PS3 game. 

[20:13] <assassinaltair7> Phil will win again 

[20:13] <paddingtonbearl87> imagine a walking dead game like this with a single player mode and refinements 

[20:13] <bobdole332> i like phil and dont assume shit like who he is dating @KingOfHypocrisy

[20:15] <amisbro> @Elite878 so is that what that "Blue wall of death" thing was about that Phil mentioned in the 
afternoon stream? 

[20:15] <assassinaltair7> I am a fan of phil but sometimes Ia€™ll watch TIHYDP for the funny moments instead 
of going through a series with over 100 episodes 
[20:15] <elzorrobot> what did i miss? 

[20:15] <elite878> @gettwobirdsstonedatonce only by about ten minutes of gameplay 
[20:15] <aiursrage2k> this game looks like ass 

[20:16] <thewisepolak> @DarksydePhil take the m4 it had more ammo 
[20:16] <hydralisk31> @Aiursrage2k It looks infinitely better on PC 
[20:16] <drilbit777> Game runs like ass on Xbox 
[20:16] <damntobi> check map see wall, stay in it 



[20:16] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Good

[20:16] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> cheer50 will you consider playing the medievil remaster once its 
released?? 

[20:17] <paddingtonbearl87> i remember renting that game 

[20:17] <amisbro> @Elite878 I had it on in the background and he kept mentioning about a blue wall so I was 
wondering what that was about so thanks for explaining the wall thing 
[20:17] <georgetdawson> they announced it at ps experience 

[20:17] <xboxl_is_garbage> A good pc port is going to be the forest, that game looks really dope 
[20:17] <elzorrobot> wow really? I love that game 

[20:17] <tupakaveli> @DarksydePhil right d-pad to equip grenades/molotov 
[20:18] <yayakaboom> Anyone else hoping that rumored Dark Souls remaster is true? 

[20:18] <damntobi> think remaster ages well? 

[20:18] <elite878> @amisbro cool NP. It’s an alright game some love or some really hate. It's fun if you play 
with friends in a squad 

[20:18] <assassinaltair7> Hey Phil are you gonna be playing the devil May Cry hd collection for PS4 when it 
comes out in March? 

[20:18] <assassinaltair7> I want a dark souls remaster or bloodborne 2

[20:18] <oooooar> bb2 pis 

[20:18] <kingofhypocrisy> This game seems like it's better to watch highlight videos of 
[20:18] <paddingtonbearl87> @kingofhypocrisy tru 

[20:19] <xboxl_is_garbage> I wish we had elder scrolls 6 and gta 6 already:( 

[20:19] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I heard about Dark Souls 1 for switch 
[20:19] <chairmancaleb> @AssassinAltair7 HD collection or PS2 classics? 

[20:19] <amisbro> @Elite878 I believe it. I'm not much of an FPS guy (I know this is 3rd but still) but I enjoy 
watching it for sure. I can see why its divisive though 
[20:19] <assassinaltair7> HD collection 

[20:19] <jewbacca2o3> @DarksydePhil cheerlO Does this game run like crap on the Xbox One i heard its like 
lOfps on Xbox One X. 

[20:19] <paddingtonbearl87> damn u can hear the bombin from far 

[20:19] <assassinaltair7> Ita€™s coming to PS4 in March 

[20:19] <amisbro> @KingOfHypocrisy I kind of have that feeling too 

[20:20] <elite878> @amisbro I'm not myself, more into RPG's but all my mates was on this and got hooked 
myself for a bit lol 

[20:20] <elite878> This runs on Anna 3 engine apparently 

[20:20] <paddingtonbearl87> fortnite on One X is buttery smooth InuyoFace 

[20:20] <amisbro> @Elite878 I getcha. Are you a Western RPG or Japanese RPG person 

[20:20] <damntobi> major graphics differance 

[20:21] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> 8x scope EU; 

[20:21] <solid_fantasy> What is this , Hunger Games 

[20:21] <elite878> @amisbro both but more western. I'm loving divinity sin 2 and been playing victor Vran too 
recently 

[20:21] <assassinaltair7> I thought this would be the game that made Sony fanboys rage but honestly I 
understand why theya€™re laughing lazy devs 

[20:21] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> jesus phil...columbine coat? lmao 
[20:21] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> ... coat LUL

[20:22] <rainycityradio> "Columbine Coat" gotta remember that one 
[20:22] <salt_fist> it was the chuckle 

[20:22] <imaidenr> @AssassinAltair7 lool so you taught this game is so good that the people who had 

Bloodborne to play on the PS4 be salty cause of it ? FailFish 

[20:22] <damntobi> persona 5 :( you wanna go to sleep pall simulator 

[20:23] <sb_tooshort> is this the guy that wanked on stream? 

[20:23] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> @ThatAnonyRaccoon he 

[20:23] <hydralisk31> @ShortNosesOnlyRescueTeens Dick and tit jokes only make your audience entertained 
for so long, he had to move to a new genre 

[20:23] <amisbro> @Elite878 I have Persona 5 but for some reason I get distracted with other games. Like I 
have Life is Strange I still need to finish 
[20:23] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> heh* 

[20:23] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> @sb_tooshort no 

[20:23] <211 trill> @assa@assassinaltair7 why would they rage fortnite battle royal is free for ps4 
[20:23] <assassinaltair7> No he was scratching his leg!!!!! 

[20:23] <rainycityradio> "scratching his leg" Kappa 

[20:23] <assassinaltair7> Fortnite is okay at best 

[20:23] <georgetdawson> is he dropping frames on stream or is it me? 

[20:23] <paddingtonbearl87> scratching mah CAWK mskkF 
[20:23] <imaidenr> and PUBG is trash 

[20:23] <rainycityradio> No, this game drops frames like a motherfucker 
[20:23] <hydralisk31> @georgetdawson game runs badly on consoles 

[20:23] <elite878> @amisbro first life is strange was good but second was god awful. Watched Phil playing it 
and it was a cringe of a story. Enjoy first though 5Y‘ □ □ 

[20:23] <211 trill> fortnite actually has action 

[20:24] <jewbacca2o3> Fortnite is WAY better than this game 

[20:24] <rickyberwick> sup 

[20:24] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> there was this itch on his leg that was annoying him for hours so he was 
orgasming in relief after scratching it 

[20:24] <systemerror45> fortnite is good on console, pubg is good on pc 

[20:24] <blk_mage_ctype> I feel like this game ought to have zombies in it. Just seems odd how all these houses 
are abandoned with gear left inside. 

[20:24] <georgetdawson> @Hydralisk31 i meant stream buffering 
[20:24] <kinggoken> The best damn stream on TWITCH 
[20:24] <hydralisk31> @georgetdawson looks fine to me 
[20:24] <clunkyd> pubg is sucks in general 

[20:24] <georgetdawson> @Kinggoken woah how many months is your crown? 

[20:24] <rainycityradio> Fortnite and PUBG are both cancer tbh 
[20:24] <jewbacca2o3> WOW this game is so boring OMG 

[20:24] <assassinaltair7> Jew youa€™re only saying that because you dona€™t have an Xbox or youa€™re 
poor pubg is so much better 

[20:24] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> phil is fucked if he gets into combat with that bloody 8x scope 




[20:24] <paddingtonbearl87> @kinggoken i appreciate your enthusiasm mskkHype mskkPerf

[20:24] <211 trill> @rainycityradio lay off the acid rain bro 

[20:25] <deepdrive3254> people are actually defending this game? 

[20:25] <deepdrive3254> lol 

[20:25] <imaidenr> @AssassinAltair7 keep it down you are dumb af 

[20:25] <amisbro> @Elite878 well I'll be getting to Before the Storm at some point but I liked the first game so 

far so I’ll have to see what Before the Storm does for me when I get to it 

[20:25] <assassinaltair7> Lazy devs suck though 

[20:25] <thatanonyraccoon> opinions are like assholes 

[20:25] <kinggoken> Thanks :) @paddingtonbearl87 

[20:25] <thatanonyraccoon> they should be hidden 

[20:25] <systemerror45> wtf @assassinaltair7 you relize how stupid that answer is 
[20:25] <paddingtonbearl87> :) 

[20:25] <hydralisk31> dunno which one I dislike more, PUBG or just mobas in general 
[20:25] <yayakaboom> Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.

actually are pushing this poorly optimized mess out there for Phil to suffer through... 

[20:25] <that_randy> Kreygasm 

[20:25] <paddingtonbearl87> good shot mskkS 

[20:25] <elipsion> improvement PogChamp 

[20:26] <systemerror45> fortnite and pubg are good games, but are good on diffrent platforms 

[20:26] <extracheeez> dspCowboy 

[20:26] <yayakaboom> Phil with those pumped up kicks. 

[20:26] <beatlesl2335> Get the car!! 

[20:26] <damntobi> in before first 



[20:26] <imaidenr> you took your time though 
[20:26] <smackhammerl> omg he should play godhand 
[20:26] <assassinaltair7> I wonder if they will fix this game 
[20:26] <kinggoken> God hand is gud 
[20:26] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Legit with a gun LUL 
[20:26] <deepdrive3254> with the columbine coat on too 
[20:26] <rainycityradio> Number 1 with a bullet 
[20:26] <clunkyd> that scope really helped 

[20:26] <hydralisk31> @AssassinAltair7 Probably not, blueballs already has most peoples money already 
[20:26] <paddingtonbearl87> ull probably enjoy this game the more "comfortable" u are with confrontation 
mskkPerf 

[20:26] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> @smackhammerl imagine the salt!! 

[20:26] <baylesstheg0> phil thats how you play the game.... 

[20:26] <smackhammerl> @nickyrickydickyanddawn95 fir

[20:26] <rainycityradio> awk awk awk 

[20:26] <paddingtonbearl87> mskkFail 

[20:27] <onesnortyboi> Better than another Nazi joke I guess 

[20:27] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> @smackhammerl that game is harder then the soulsborne series imo 

[20:27] <georgetdawson> cars more if you needed to move quicklu 

[20:27] <hydralisk31> @OneSnortyBoi Yeah at least this one won't get him banned 

[20:27] <rainycityradio> Hitler did nothing wrong Kappa 

[20:27] <smackhammerl> in a way 

[20:27] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ita€™d be funnier if Phil had the same gun too 
[20:27] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> u killed him because the car wasnt moving... 

[20:27] <baylesstheg0> phil people have mastered this game and they use cars every chance they get 

[20:27] <enterplayofficial> @DarksydePhil Wishing you a warm Christmas and lovely holidays, all the way from 

Holland! 

[20:27] <extracheeez> lol he wasn't moving!!!

[20:28] <paddingtonbearl87> @shortnosesonlyrescueteens lmao that is true mskkC 
[20:28] <elite878> Airdrops are just death 
[20:28] <beatlesl2335> shoot him down 

[20:28] <baylesstheg0> playing safe in pybg hardly ever works 
[20:28] <rjl7opticreaper> This game should be on ps4 

[20:28] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> theyd seen him even if the grass rendered idk why he thinks they cant see 
him LUL 

[20:28] <tupakaveli> Lol 

[20:28] <rainycityradio> playing safe gets me in the top 5 almost every time xD 
[20:28] <doomtrain84> wow what exciting gameplay! 

[20:28] <damntobi> tihdp still a thing? your leader was a sociopath 

[20:28] <butter_my_bread> spend half the game laying down like a corner hooker. Marvelous game dood 

[20:28] <imaidenr> you r dead 

[20:28] <backwoodz47> game is really fun other than lag 

[20:28] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> that 8x scope is gonna bite phil in the ass 

[20:28] <assassinaltair7> Pubg coming to PS4 as late as 2019 

[20:28] <kinggoken> Lmao @butter_my_bread 

[20:28] <paddingtonbearl87> @butter_my_bread lmao LUL 



[20:29] <hydralisk31> This game is really fun, sadly consoles can't run it properly, although that's devs fault, it's 
horribly optimized 

[20:29] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> now hes in close quarters with an 8x scope >_< 

[20:29] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> philllllll 

[20:29] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I could live in this house, looks nice 
[20:29] <calinks> [uptime 

[20:29] <assassinaltair7> The Xbox one can handle this game ita€™s the awful devs 
[20:29] <salt_fist> you can zoom in and out with 8 time scope 

[20:29] <paddingtonbearl87> phil u dont have to walk around like a creeper i think the footsteps are jus as loud 
from walking normally 

[20:29] <enterplayofficial> PC's can't run this well either...it's just a horribly coded mess, but great fun... 

[20:29] <imaidenr> wait until they kill each other 

[20:29] <okimas> did he even loot the dude he killed at the car? 

[20:29] <baylesstheg0> is his reaction time usually this slow when he plays games like this? 

[20:29] <rainycityradio> this house is nicer than my apartment 
[20:29] <backwoodz47> i just finished 2nd havent crashed yet 
[20:29] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> @BaylessTHEg0 yes 

[20:29] <assassinaltair7> The Xbox one could run this at 1080p 60fps look at halo 5 

[20:29] <hydralisk31> @ENTERPLAYOfficial I get steady 100 fps in medium settings, can’t even get close to 
that on console 

[20:29] <ipunchedsanta> Which Xbox is he playing on? 

[20:30] <yayakaboom> Better run, better run, outrun Phil's gun, lmfao. 

[20:30] <tupakaveli> pick the pan it'll save your ass... literally. 

[20:30] <kingofhypocrisy> houses are for squares, khandoes are where it's at 
[20:30] <tupakaveli> up* 

[20:30] <rainycityradio> khandoes? is that where I make quality khantent? 

[20:30] <enterplayofficial> @Hydralisk31 Oh you are correct, don't get me wrong, the PC runs this BETTER 

than the Xbox, but still, even on beastly systems, performance nowhere near perfect 

[20:30] <elite878> @assassinaltair7 PC' are struggling hold 60fps on this. It's do badly optimised. 

[20:30] <paddingtonbearl87> whats the problem, ur fine InuyoFace 

[20:30] <sb_tooshort> anyone have the link to DPS video of him begging for money?

[20:42] <kozatof> dspSexy dspSexy 

[20:42] <assassinaltair7> Bayless ita€™s not the consoles fault 
[20:42] <deepdrive3254> this game was made before fonite ragegaming 
[20:42] <plagueweilder97> @DarksydePhil are you exited for Soulcalibur 6? :) 

[20:42] <thatanonyraccoon> so forntite is the copycat 
[20:43] <rainycityradio> Fortnite ripped this game off xD 
[20:43] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Oh draw distance.... 

[20:43] <johntt96> is this a diashow? 

[20:43] <thatanonyraccoon> the led zeppelin, so to speak 



[20:43] <damntobi> yup 

[20:43] <baylessthegO> hi was first 

[20:43] <paddingtonbearl87> they BOTH COPIED hlzl 

[20:43] <rainycityradio> this game ripped off H1Z1 King of the Kill 

[20:43] <enterplayofficial> Really, all of these games stole the idea from Day Z tbh 

[20:43] <cte900> this game ripped off HiZl king of the hill 

[20:43] <asalings96> this game has so much more potential than fortnite with future updates 
[20:43] <kinggoken> Fortnite is better though 

[20:43] <magnusflamebeard> Oooh I want SoulCal 6 :D big fan since Soul Calibur 2 
[20:43] <ragegamingl24> their all garabge 5Y~,5Y~,5Y~,5Y‘< 

[20:43] <nightbot> RageGamingl24 -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning] 

[20:43] <strangezz> I dona€™t know how a game can copy a genre 

[20:43] <hellthurian> @BaylessTHEg0 Actually Anna had a mod for this before em all. 

[20:43] <cte900> damn beat me to it @RainyCityRadio 
[20:43] <damntobi> hlzl came with a cool zombie mode 
[20:43] <elite878> This game ripped off battle royal 
[20:43] <rainycityradio> :P 

[20:43] <thatanonyraccoon> @RainyCityRadio did that game do the same drop in from a plane, and the closing 
circles gimmicks? 

[20:43] <paddingtonbearl87> poppin InuyoFace 

[20:43] <systemerror45> battleground was forst created in anna 2 and 3, nothing ripped nothing off. its just a 
gamemode 

[20:43] <pcgamehunter> @Kinggoken I don’t think I heard you, what is better Kappa ? 

[20:43] <paddingtonbearl87> mary PoppinZ 
[20:43] <pcgamehunter> For the 45th time ? OpieOP 
[20:43] <ragegamingl24> all 3 of those games are trash 
[20:43] <calo_nord_> pawpin? 

[20:44] <rainycityradio> @ThatAnonyRaccoon I think so 

[20:44] <strangezz> PUBG is the only game allowed to have br any other game that has br is definitely a copy cat 
[20:44] <lvlpower> fortnight look better run better 

[20:44] <extracheeez> are there pubg modes with no guns, just fists and hand weapons? 

[20:44] <nighthunt01> this game ripped off Mario 64 

[20:44] <kozatof> @thatanonyraccoon dspShock 

[20:44] <thatanonyraccoon> @RainyCityRadio ahhh, that makes sense 

[20:44] <pcgamehunter> Also sup trashpanda KonCha 

[20:44] <rainycityradio> rainycSunsetPierceWink 

[20:44] <kinggoken> Fortnite way better than this 

[20:44] <kingofhypocrisy> this game is a gta clone Kappa 

[20:44] <jbowler21> hey guys, hi phil.dY™, 

[20:44] <damntobi> LUL 

[20:44] <seckslord> damn xbox version looks like mad ass i gotta say 
[20:44] <strangezz> It looks good on xbone x 

[20:44] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I thought that wall said Octomom 
[20:44] <damntobi> no it doesnt 
[20:44] <jewbacca2o3> Ps4 owns all 
[20:44] <chem_zegarra2018> Why is it the same map? 

[20:45] <rainycityradio> I run this game on PC on the lowest settings, this version looks exactly like it 
[20:45] <paddingtonbearl87> @jewbacca2o3 is this onps4? 

[20:45] <assassinaltair7> PS4 is not better than Xbox one 
[20:45] <elite878> There's only one map 

[20:45] <deepdrive3254> theres only one map in this game chem 
[20:45] <comfrtblynumb> well phil you missed a helmet, 



[20:45] <asalings96> I must say this game is wildly difficult but is still so much fun 
[20:45] <this_game_is_garbage> cheerlO Play Fortnite 

[20:45] <systemerror45> xbox pubg looks like shit, the draw distance is fuckin horrendous 
[20:45] <seckslord> and you get 3x the fps i bet 
[20:45] <strangezz> ever try pc ?? 

[20:45] <rainycityradio> There's only one map until full release 
[20:45] <kozatof> @deepdrive3254 howa€™s it been 
[20:45] <assassinaltair7> The games are better but not the system itself 
[20:45] <jewbacca2o3> No Ps4 has other games it will be on Ps4 in March tho 

[20:45] <pcgamehunter> Deep ban King I think his keyboard is stuck on "FORTNITE IS BETTER" Kappa 

[20:45] <deepdrive3254> sup kozatof 

[20:45] <rainycityradio> then there will be TWO 

[20:45] <extracheeez> can't stop the bum rush! 

[20:45] <lvlpower> @Chem_Zegarra2018 this the only map on xbox soon there be a new map 
[20:45] <deepdrive3254> pretty good 

[20:45] <damntobi> if only nintendo would stop making consoles, and sell its ips 
[20:45] <lickthese256> You should use full auto IMO very inaccurate 
[20:45] <cybersaint313> fortnight sucks balls 
[20:45] <kinggoken> Lmao 

[20:45] <chem_zegarra2018> Oh man. That sucks. Well there be more maps? Feels like one map is boring 
[20:45] <lickthese256> Shouldna€™t *+ 

[20:45] <comfrtblynumb> fortnie shit and this game is only pc fun 

[20:46] <jewbacca2o3> @DarksydePhil Can you play Fortnite it has 50 vs 50 this game is hot ass 
[20:46] <seckslord> at least 2 more 8x8km maps being released 

[20:46] <h0nneys> @stranGezz Does it have stable framerate and less popping in textures and buildings on X ? 

[20:46] <deepdrive3254> lol pcgamehunter 

[20:46] <strangezz> what does Phil usually play 

[20:46] <baylesstheg0> fortnites really good and really optimized 

[20:46] <blindkarevik666> PC just released a desert map 

[20:46] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I think they got Nintendo to use the draw distance engine from Skyward 
Sword 

[20:46] <rainycityradio> Fortnight and PUBG are both cancer imo 
[20:46] <blindkarevik666> or will be releasing soon, haven't played in a bit 

[20:46] <asalings96> this game is going to get updates to eventually catch up to PC like minecraft did when it 
came to xbox 

[20:46] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> cheer50 have you ever watched the tv show Hamtaro?? 

[20:46] <kushiyakitori> very surprised he hasn’t said anything about the devs yet 
[20:46] <pcgamehunter> King is worse his FPS is very low. SAD dspEw 

[20:46] <cte900> use that to your advantage and stand in the shadows, everyone has the same settings on console 

[20:46] <damntobi> remember ark survival on console LUL 

[20:46] <paddingtonbearl87> lmao nicky i remember that show 

[20:46] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 

[20:46] <bloodmoonthx> wooow what a great game 

[20:46] <damntobi> its never gonna get up to date on pc 

[20:46] <kozatof> @damntobi no way 

[20:46] <pcgamehunter> @KushiYakitori He probably doesn't even know who it is, so he has no target vector 
Kappa 

[20:47] <rainycityradio> >Adult Swim 

[20:47] <kozatof> I dona€™t believe ark was on console 

[20:47] <comfrtblynumb> you're missing quite a few items Phil, try to look better 
[20:47] <paddingtonbearl87> noooo it was a kids show on in the morning 
[20:47] <seckslord> is there mini 14 in xbox version? 



[20:47] <strangezz> no duh 

[20:47] <ragegamingl24> i just dont like it cause people can Utterly stay in one fucking spot and they can shoot 

u from super far and theirs nothing u can do about it 

[20:47] <kushiyakitori> @pcgamehunter lrnao. actually, I think you're right 

[20:47] <asalings96> mini 14 is on xbox 

[20:47] <kinggoken> Hamtaro was my shit yo 

[20:47] <smackhammerl> you ever seen bobobobobobobo? 

[20:47] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ark is on PS4

[20:47] <paddingtonbearl87> hamsters FUQING Is on adult swim

[20:47] <damntobi> cool concept tho 

[20:47] <kozatof> Dang 

[20:47] <asalings96> this is where you switch to FPS lol 

[20:47] <plagueweilder97> Fortnite looks and runs better than this overrated game 

[20:47] <pcgamehunter> Those asking him to play on PC clearly are new and have no idea how BAD an idea 
that is. 

[20:47] <paddingtonbearl87> how are YOU doin phil? InuyoFace 
[20:47] <rainycityradio> R.I.P 

[20:47] <cybersaint313> game volume is like 25% too loud 
[20:47] <calo_nord_> lol 
[20:47] <jewbacca2o3> Fortnite>PUBG 
[20:47] <kushiyakitori> no flank? 

[20:48] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Not sure, just seen it on the psn store 
[20:48] <bloodmoonthx> behind u 

[20:48] <rainycityradio> CoD WWII > PUBG & Fortnite Kappa 

[20:48] <pcgamehunter> Trust me, if he managed to get the game to work, his PC to stream and internet not to 

die. North Korea will then nuke Seattle OpieOP 

[20:48] <fireog420> this game is actually good on PC guys 

[20:48] <strangezz> @plagueweilder97 so just because it runs better means ita€™s a better game? 

[20:48] <fireog420> i promise 

[20:48] <kozatof> @plagueweilder97 cartoon graphics run better 
[20:48] <extracheeez> he’ll come from behind 
[20:48] <paddingtonbearl87> probably ran off 

[20:48] <butter_my_bread> they should of made them dance halls then the game wouldn’t be derviative dood 

[20:48] <paddingtonbearl87> had no healing 
[20:48] <plagueweilder97> both games all boring imo 
[20:48] <rainycityradio> A 

[20:49] <pcgamehunter> Andromeda is shit DansGame.just thought I’d chime in Kappa 

[20:49] <elite878> Lol forget this asshole 
[20:49] <pcgamehunter> No bethe ? good Keeepo 
[20:49] <pcgamehunter> Keepo 

[20:49] <fireog420> it does get boring running for like 20 mins just to die 
[20:49] <strangezz> then watch someone else? 

[20:49] <bloodmoonthx> phil what is your most embarrising moment ever on stream? 

[20:49] <paddingtonbearl87> @fireog420 yeah man 
[20:49] <paddingtonbearl87> if there was zombies in this 




[20:49] <damntobi> cod ww2 sucks just as much, 2 week unplayable, and still full of shit headquarter, spawn 
waits 

[20:49] <paddingtonbearl87> it would be dope 

[20:50] <asalings96> i must say the struggle of not having a vehicle sucks 
[20:50] <strangezz> thata€™s not br then? 

[20:50] <paddingtonbearl87> u shouldnt be able to jus hide 
[20:50] <bloodmoonthx> phil what is your favorite ice cream flavor??? 

[20:50] <yusukel4k> Play Escape from tarkav 

[20:50] <rainycityradio> Maybe they should add zombies to this Kappa 

[20:50] <lickthese256> If u push down on the d pad and hold it you can use your Bandages or first aid kit 

without going to your inventory menu 

[20:50] <calo_nord_> you just have to aim Kappa 

[20:50] <sekander> ya there should be boars u can shoot, like in warcraft 

[20:50] <paddingtonbearl87> ah nice shadows 

[20:50] <amisbro> watching NASCAR is more interesting and they just turn left for a couple of hours 

[20:50] <butter_my_bread> @damntobi i knew it would fizzle fast, the game's dying and once Treyarch's new 

game gets announced everyone will forgetcit exists 

[20:50] <pcgamehunter> It's part of the gameplay, you're suppose to keep an eye out for the enemy while 
traversing a huge map, it's the whole appeal of the game 

[20:51] <solar_vp> play more aggressive, this game was never designed for xbox lol 
[20:51] <strangezz> AA 

[20:51] <paddingtonbearl87> i mean its jus as repetitive 
[20:51] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Hey NASCAR has crashes 
[20:51] Abutter_my_bread> bowling is better too dood 

[20:51] <pcgamehunter> They should instead do like 500 players and spread them around automatically to make 
it more interesting 

[20:51] <h0nneys> @RainyCityRadio Lets dot it, it shall be named "Z-Battlegrounds" 

[20:51] <strangezz> This is high risk high reward 

[20:51] <blindkarevik666> I prefer it like this, if I just want a survival run I'll drop in the middle of nowhere, if I 
want a firelight I'll drop at school, military base, or sometimes Pochinki... although bombing runs seem to love 
Pochinki 

[20:51] <rainycityradio> @h0nneys Yeah Keepo 

[20:51] <damntobi> @Butter_My_Bread i skipped all the double jump cods, i played the others before,but this 

one isnt the one thats gonna save em 
[20:52] <sekander> headshot incoming :P 

[20:52] <paddingtonbearl87> @strangezz phil jus got rewarded a dirty white tank top for all his efforts LUL 
[20:52] <asalings96> 500 players? what server is gonna handle that? 

[20:52] <majinboo3> he needs to stop playing solo and play squad 
[20:52] <damntobi> too much attention on HQ and lootboxes 
[20:52] <bloodmoonthx> lots of stream snipers on this game watch out 
[20:52] <kozatof> @darksydephil try squad mode 

[20:52] <amisbro> Well let's look at it from this perspective: At least with that you get some noise and 
commentary but here there is nothing to really talk about so you legit could fall asleep with the controller in your 
hand 

[20:52] <pcgamehunter> When it's like a 27,000 km2 area 100 people ain't exactly much dspFacepahn 

[20:52] <elite878> @majinboo3 definitely, where this game is a lot more fun part of a squad 

[20:52] <pcgamehunter> Or whatever they scaled it down to 

[20:52] <majinboo3> squad is very fun 

[20:52] <qu4ck_> solo more fun anyway tbh 

[20:52] <majinboo3> sincew you just troll 

[20:52] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> who says 90 times out of 100 
[20:52] <butter_my_bread> unrewarding monotony this game rooREE 



[20:52] <this_game_is_garbage> @DarksydePhil is there any music in this game? 

[20:52] <paddingtonbearl87> isnt pubg on ps4? 

[20:52] <majinboo3> Solo is not fun at all just a clusterfuck 
[20:53] <rainycityradio> nope 

[20:53] <majinboo3> where one nigga wins by camping 
[20:53] <rainycityradio> PUBG is Xbox exclusive Kappa 
[20:53] <damntobi> carantan double xp, only map, LUL 
[20:53] <paddingtonbearl87> ohh ok 
[20:53] <strangezz> nah 

[20:53] <plagueweilder97> to think that this game almost won GOTY on TGA.... 

[20:53] <thatanonyraccoon> no music 

[20:53] <majinboo3> atleast squad you actually need teamwork 

[20:53] <enterplayofficial> So a $250+ headset only works with 1 console? Sorry but that is just stupid... 

[20:53] <beatlesl2335> you dont have to use a mic for it, you coulf try it 
[20:53] <damntobi> its so backwards 
[20:53] <strangezz> xbox exclusive? 

[20:53] <pcgamehunter> MingLee 

[20:53] <paddingtonbearl87> i thought it was early release on xbox 
[20:53] <strangezz> jk I know lol 
[20:53] <calo_nord_> is this on gameboy? 

[20:53] <kingofhypocrisy> this would be more interesting on a smaller map 

[20:53] <butter_my_bread> so potential trolls aren't a deterrent anymore, that's cool 

[20:53] <seckslord> @majinboo3 nigga i just got a chicken dinner from running over the last 3 people 
[20:53] <solar_vp> false it was rumored for oit 

[20:53] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> cheer50 are you aware of a potential stalker circulating an alledged photo 
of you at the mall with your gf?? 

[20:53] <blindkarevik666> Also, think of it this way too... there's a huge amount of people playing this version 
who have never played it before so they're playing it safe. It's a lot more hectic on PC since everyone knows the 
map like the back of their hand. 

[20:53] <kinggoken> Lol 

[20:53] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Oh well, we got Bloodborne, way better LUL 
[20:53] <solar_vp> it* 

[20:53] <kozatof> @nickyrickydickyanddawn95 thata€™s old friend 

[20:53] <godmodeenabled> no music, giant empty map, not enough players, shit framerate, bleh 
[20:53] <rainycityradio> "gf' 

[20:53] <mikej254> you don’t need a mic just try it 
[20:53] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> im worried about him 
[20:53] <majinboo3> he never goes to the high pop areas thats why 
[20:53] <paddingtonbearl87> @nickyrickydickyanddawn95 wtf mskkUH 
[20:54] <thatanonyraccoon> stalkers, nice 

[20:54] <majinboo3> if he lands in pochinki or military base it would be ogre in 1 minute 
[20:54] <asalings96> if he doesn’t get to a vehicle RIP 

[20:54] <rainycityradio> there's also the screenshot that shows his gf is a hired escort xD 

[20:54] <majinboo3> literally 30 niggas spawn there 

[20:54] <nickyrickydickyanddawn95> is it a real photo 

[20:54] <arnity> @NickyRickyDickyandDawn95 you just gonna piss him off

[21:05] <enterplayofficial> Disrespect got popular streaming this one game, and is now trapped in a situation 
where people will only accept him streaming PUBG basically, and he’s good at it...I don't find him entertaining

[21:06] <hokhmuch> try it 

[21:06] <h0nneys> @ENTERPLAYOfficial Actually he became popular playing H1Z1 and gaining additional 
audience due to pubg 

[21:06] <oooooar> oh phil ur actually really funny

[21:08] <blindkarevik666> As much as I love this game, I think the only way it’ll exit "Early access" is when its 
popularity dies down and they use "Fulll Release" as a last ditch to get players back. 

[21:08] <thebrokenlegs218> cheerlO I guess butthole games said to the players "Thanks for the money 
dummies". 

[21:08] <r2df> why is he crouch walking?

[21:08] <mis_diego> why not 

[21:08] <damntobi> he is like a lion

[21:12] <hOnneys> @beatlesl2335 I think there is no way this game is gotta be fun as long as there is no Aim 
assist and seperate servers for console only.

[21:18] <this_game_is_garbage> cheer 10 waste of $30 

[21:18] <pcgamehunter> Courts are only somewhat payable when the government is forcing you to stand at one

[21:18] <onehundredapm> he didnt fully reload LUL 

[21:18] <amisbro> No Trolling but I can see this game being a legit "boredquit" 

[21:18] <rtucker913> It's based on both skill and luck 
[21:18] <elzorrobot> Battle Royale in a game basically 

[21:18] <xeliza_> Controller needs an auto aim to be accurate 

[21:18] <elite878> Yea game sucks solo 
[21:18] <paddingtonbearl87> DESTINY 2 
[21:18] <datoneguyweallknow> I’d rather see more CoD 
[21:18] <damntobi> d2 sucks also 

[21:18] <dylantion> you should play some COD or Battlefront 2! 

[21:18] <qu4ck_> It is boring and the game sucks. It promotes patience and just playing in a boring way if you 
want to have a high chance of consistently making top 10 

[21:18] <pcgamehunter> True, but Minecraft actually did it well. These are pathetic in comparison. 

[21:19] <stillstream42> I think they ported the mobile port by accident. 

[21:19] <solid_fantasy> Let's make NFS Payback go rival 
[21:19] <rtucker913> You shouldn’t judge people on what they like

[21:24] <skiUjoker> sis is a semi auto use it like a sniper 
[21:24] <verakor> he drop all his ammo 

[21:24] <shintherobot> you can get a pc for less than a xbox that can run this game better 

[21:25] <this_game_is_garbage> people play this because they think its "cool" to play, but they all secretly hate 

it deep inside 

[21:25] <skiUjoker> sks* 

[21:25] <calo_nord_> im omw to ur house @damntobi Kappa 

[21:25] <butter_my_bread> @This_Game_Is_Garbage Sup dood rooHi 

[21:25] <this_game_is_garbage> sup butter 

[21:25] <damntobi> i know dood, bro girl homie, dont do that HEHEHEH ill convert to your believes 
[21:25] <rtucker913> Vests give you extra space too 

[21:25] <stillstream42> Microsoft should be investing their money in interesting Xbox Exclusives. Not PUBG 
and Minecraft. (Although, Cuphead is good) 

[21:25] <kingofhypocrisy> @Calo_Nord_ are you named after that bounty hunter from kotor? 

[21:25] <calo_nord_> yes 

[21:26] <elzorrobot> @This_Game_Is_Garbage lol kinda like high school gangs, which would explain the 
demographics of players here 

[21:26] <extracheeez> would love to see phil play cuphead 
[21:26] <kingofhypocrisy> thought the name looked familiar 
[21:26] <damntobi> he did 

[21:26] <thatanonyraccoon> imagine if someone took this forumla and actually made a good game out of it 
[21:26] <infinite_55> So, howa€™s Phila€™s second run of this? 

[21:26] <thatanonyraccoon> but with furries 

[21:26] <dylantion> I'm constantly mesmerized by the freaky Bob Ross hairdo of this dude. 

[21:26] <paddingtonbearl87> knapSAQ 

[21:26] <beatlesl2335> This port was a mistake, made people think a fun little indy project was awful 
[21:26] <lvlpower> @Extracheeez phil did play cuphead 
[21:26] <sidella434> So hows Phil Doing 
[21:26] <dudderasl3> FBtouchdown 

[21:26] <extracheeez> @lvlpower whoah... how long did he last? 

[21:26] <assassinaltair7> You cannot make a gaming pc with the price of a console. Maybe if the console was 



400 but rn current gen is 200 sometimes below 150 

[21:26] <thatanonyraccoon> @Sidella434 very well, the game crashes constantly 
[21:26] <damntobi> console problems, get highest textures, lowest fps 
[21:26] <dudderasl3> The game is good 

[21:27] <enterplayofficial> Phil seems to be getting demoralized to be honest, he probably would love to play 
anything else at this point... 

[21:27] <pcgamehunter> Um no they didn’t get highest textures, they got the worst too MingLee 

[21:27] <smackhammerl> @extracheeez he beat it 

[21:27] <assassinaltair7> Phil looks so bored 

[21:27] <damntobi> i know i was joking but i wasnt 

[21:27] <fatestayjedi> luptime 

[21:27] <plagueweilder97> try Rainbow 6 Siege intead 

[21:27] <pcgamehunter> If you look on the PC ver. The textures are infinitely better, here it's like someone ran a 
cloth over the png file OpieOP 

[21:27] <fatestayjedi> how long has phil been streaming the session? 

[21:27] <damntobi> they TRY to get highest textures, but killing fps 

[21:27] <infinite_55> cheer 100 I gotta take off. Good luck with the rest of the stream Phil! 

[21:28] <sidella434> @ThatAnonyRaccoon Well I admit the game look shitty but I never played a game like this 
before 

[21:28] <elite878> Fck don't play r6 another bore fest of a game 

[21:28] <nukacolaking> Just imagine the mobile version of PUBG.... MingLee 

[21:28] <paddingtonbearl87> better late than never InuyoFace 

[21:28] <skii_joker> I'm having fun on pubg xbox aiming is easy after playing it for a bit 

[21:28] <thatanonyraccoon> run over a child 

[21:28] <onehundredapm> only 1 tire shot careful 

[21:28] <lvlpower> @Extracheeez the bosses were frustrate to phil 

[21:28] <this_game_is_garbage> no music, no action, slow game play, generic 3rd person shooter... i dont think 

phil realizes nobody wants to watch this garbage 

[21:28] <plagueweilder97> @Elite878 much better than this.. 

[21:28] <fercho5596> no wheel LUL 

[21:28] <thatanonyraccoon> i mean a child playing the game irl 
[21:28] <arnity> Why are the wheels flying? 

[21:28] <extracheeez> oh fawk how did I miss Phil playing Cuphead... I see the youtube videos now. Got some 
watching to do. The game was frustrating for everyone. :) 

[21:28] <pcgamehunter> I'm guessing you never heard of ARMA or DayZ or any mods for battlefield or other 
games. This game is anything but innovative 
[21:28] <paddingtonbearl87> CRUISIN USA 

[21:28] <thebrokenlegs218> cheerlO phil ur car is missing a front left tire. 

[21:28] <elite878> @plagueweilder97 it is but for viewing wise it bores me personally

[21:29] <smackhammerl> is this offroad mission in need for speed? 

[21:29] <onehundredapm> gotta shoot 2 tires to ruin a car for the next player 
[21:29] <stillstream42> No spark effects on the missing tire? Lazy! 

[21:29] <damntobi> didnt he get in a reviewers list for cuphead 
[21:29] <plagueweilder97> @Elite878 this is worse m8 atleats r6 is action 

[21:29] <pcgamehunter> They were basically this with a different skin, some of which were way more polished 
[21:29] <butter_my_bread> @damntobi did he? that's news to me 




[21:29] <paddingtonbearl87> hit up the PAY N SPRAY 
[21:29] <paddingtonbearl87> get it repaired

[21:33] <idontdietobaboons> Why are you guys all hating on this game 

[21:33] <this_game_is_garbage> i dont understand how such a popular game with 10 million players has like 5 
people in this mpa 

[21:33] <backwoodz47> stfu bout the gm 

[21:33] <sirnoblex> @idontdietobaboons It's amazing on PC, not so much Xbox 
[21:33] <aldondrius> this game is so boring, walking simulator 

[21:33] <damntobi> we dont hate on this game but we hate on the execution of the game 

[21:33] <jewbacca2o3> Fortnite is so much better 

[21:33] <elite878> @idontdietobaboons cause it's average at best 

[21:33] <backwoodz47> petty mofos 

[21:33] <drowningfishl2> the game is overrated 

[21:34] <rtucker913> I don’t care what anyone thinks. This game is great 
[21:34] <damntobi> right 

[21:34] <roeygabay> This game looks better than fort nite cartoon azz 
[21:34] <paddingtonbearl87> @rtucker913 NOT on console tho InuyoFace 
[21:34] <sidella434> I cant wait for okami 
[21:34] <drowningfishl2> atleast in my opinion its overrated 

[21:34] <pcgamehunter> I'm not arguing I could care less about either of them, not gonna waste time on them ... 
[21:34] <ello_gov> @rtucker913 its just because a game is popular, it gets hate from everyone who doesn’t like it 
[21:34] <thatanonyraccoon> it's a great concept with underwhelming execution 
[21:34] <solidussnakex> @Sethl89 got a problem ? 

[21:34] <captain_tardigrade> this is a gamer’s game, it's not for casuals 
[21:34] <beatlesl2335> Seriously, yhe PORT sucks not the game 
[21:34] <rtucker913> Oh well I'm a PC person so 

[21:34] <idontdietobaboons> @sirnoblex I dona€™t have a pc and I have an Xbox this game is so fun especially 
cause I hit 1100 on NA Solos 

[21:34] <drilbit777> i think phil should just play this on pc lol 



[21:34] <paddingtonbearl87> @thatanonyraccoon well said 
[21:34] <damntobi> port A 

[21:34] <seth 189> just don’t understand what u mean

[21:34] <onehundredapm> open doors means looted usually 
[21:34] <cdownie28> dude pickup that grip 
[21:35] <ovenclean> phone 

[21:35] <fatestayjedi> @Drilbit777 i think he would have an even harder time against mouse users lol 
[21:35] <drowningfishl2> he could just play fortnite but ig not 

[21:35] <backwoodz47> i boughtt the gm becaus i enjoy it not because its popular bums 
[21:35] <cookie042> it's like putting csgo on xbox and wondering why nobody likes it. 

[21:35] <rtucker913> IDK if he even has a PC 

[21:35] <damntobi> yeah welll its console not pc 

[21:35] <sirnoblex> @Drilbit777 Apparently, his PC can't run it. 

[21:35] <roeygabay> I never played this game and I see why it was game of the year, the concept is really cool-1 
knew a hunger game type game would work 
[21:35] <sirnoblex> @rtucker913 Who Phil? 

[21:35] <captain_tardigrade> @Frankenfunk wait to hear this, consoles are for casuals as well unless it's just a 
side platform 

[21:35] <pcgamehunter> His PC can run it, he can't stream while playing tho 
[21:35] <cookie042> pubg is a pc game made for pc players 
[21:35] <rtucker913> OK well I think he might 

[21:35] <idontdietobaboons> @cookie042 A ton of people like idk what your on 
[21:35] <dudderasl3> Sometimes clothes make good cover 

[21:35] <sethl89> btw it can definitely run it based off of what ive hear dhis pc specs are 

[21:35] <butter_my_bread> dsp has a toaster not a PC 

[21:35] <hokhmuch> @DarksydePhil get to top 10 
[21:35] <elite878> @roeygabay this didn’t win goty 

[21:35] <cookie042> a lot do, sure, but it's not what most xbox players want 

[21:35] <hellthurian> Microsoft got cucked so hard by Bluehole. They took that money for the port and ran 
lmfao. 

[21:35] <drilbit777> he just needs a laptop to stream off it 

[21:35] <sidella434> Phil what are your thoughs aboout the game? 

[21:36] <pcgamehunter> Also this game crashes like man, he’d get owned by hardcore players and Phil honestly 
isn't patient enough to do basic tweaking needed on PC, so no he shouldn’t play on PC MingLee 
[21:36] <frankenfunk> So super smash bros is for casuals? 

[21:36] <cookie042> they will say things like "walking sim" "average game"

casual xbox player in mind 

[21:37] <onehundredapm> maybe if they add aim assist the game will be playable @ 30fps 
[21:37] <aldondrius> how does the building still stand if it's bombing, unrealistic, bad design

[21:41] <thatanonyraccoon> they'll get ya if it's a perfect zig zag 

[21:42] <pcgamehunter> @DarksydePhil Actually it's more like move sideways that way they cant aim on 
consoles Kappa

[22:10] <lthedeadcryl> nobody know what I'm talking about ever...ever. It's ok. 

[22:10] <blobbsuk> @omgzelda i know right, this shit is funny it's like watching babies tryin to play a game, i 
wish they would make this shit cross platform, what a slaughter fest that could be lol 
[22:10] <kekon3> muxylO Hey man, Street Fighter Collection in May. 

[22:10] <elite878> @britz94xd lol what? This is literally running at 20fps. Yes, yes it does run better on PC 
[22:11] <reggiejay> @DarksydePhil did you play the Resident Evil dies yet 
[22:11] <jewbacca2o3> Why does this sh*t look like its a Ps2 game? 

[22:11] <sidella434> Okami HdD is BETTER then this 

[22:11] <ta0g> you get max 30 frames on xbox, and I get a steady 100+ on PC, it looks way better on PC 
[22:11] <sethl89> A \ 

[22:11] <sethl89> A 

[22:11] <kinggoken> i'm legit laughing at the people that are complaining about the graphics 
[22:12] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Whata€™s the point of the speedometer? 

[22:12] <sethl89>ikr

[22:12] <sethl89> like what did they expect 

[22:12] <kinggoken> this game looks like crap even on PC 

[22:12] <pcgamehunter> Yeah yeah Fortnite is better we get it King Kappa 

[22:12] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Phila€™s going 64 kph 

[22:12] <kekon3> Graphics of the buildings could have been scaled back so that the game could run slightly 
better 

[22:12] <novaenforcer> @britz94xd Go onto a random PUBG game I bet theya€™re playing on PC the better 
version and are actually having fun because they have friends to play with lol 



[22:12] <sethl89> a cpu intensive game runs bad on xbox? who woulda thought 
[22:12] <tupakaveli> This stream chat has used the word frame rate a 1000 times 

[22:12] <kinggoken> the developer doesn't care either. They are swimming in their sea of money because of all 
the people that bought this. 

[22:12] <pcgamehunter> Might as well change your name to king of Fortnite Kappa 
[22:13] <britz94xd> fair enough 

[22:13] <ta0g> if you fall at like 134 I believe, you get a small boost to your drop 
[22:13] <mickjones90> muh frame rates 

[22:13] <mickjones90> play it on pc instead of this shit console known as xbone 

[22:13] <sethl89> ypu fall at 233/4 you get a boost downwards with the chute 

[22:13] <jewbacca2o3> Or get a PS4 baby 

[22:13] <sethl89> ill sitck to pc thanks 

[22:13] <blobbsuk> take the Mini .... lol 

[22:13] <elite878> @jewbacca2o3 and not play it at all :)

[22:14] <elite878> Same 

[22:14] <sethl89> yep, but i can run it well on medium-high settings at least 

[22:14] <ta0g> the game is actually really fun and addicting if you have friends to squad or duo with 

[22:14] <pcgamehunter> I think the only thing that needs to run in this game is you ... away.far away from it 

[22:15] <assassinaltair7> How long until battlefront 2 becomes a 10 dollar game 

[22:15] <blobbsuk> @clunkyd on test server its getting there ;) it's early access, not sure what ppl expect, its

[22:37] <resdizeix> Play a functional game 
[22:37] <diablo360x> Cri moar 
[22:37] <skorged_ice> fanboi 

[22:37] <nazraxx> it's an unoptimized piece of trash that you paid 30 bucks for... and you're defending it 
@diablo360x . May as well let someone shit in your mouth an praise it next. 

[22:37] <diablo360x> I've had one glitch in 30 matches. It 

[22:38] <diablo360x> s not finished, the developers makes that plain as day but it's still a blast 
[22:38] <nazraxx> you’re playing the console version correct? 

[22:38] <chairmancaleb> @diablo360x Using anecdotes as your argument? 

[22:39] <nazraxx> @diablo360x if you're playing the console version then i call bullshit on your last statement 
[22:39] <diablo360x> Me and my friends list and a lot of good impressions in threads on the net. It's a fun game, 
give it a try and you’d see 

[22:39] <chairmancaleb> The game is alright to me, I've seen it played on PC. 

[22:39] <chairmancaleb> But it's not something I have to go get. 

[22:39] <diablo360x> Was this Xblx? Not bullshitting. 

[22:39] <chairmancaleb> I'll catch it on a sale one day if it's still booming. 

[22:40] <diablo360x> I was the same way but my friends wanted me to play with, now I'm hooked 

[22:41] <diablo360x> Nothing but confirmation bias strengthened by a terrible streamer named phil, he makes 

the best games look like shit. 

[22:43] <darksydephil> idiot 

[22:43] <darksydephil> yes, its my fault the game sucks
