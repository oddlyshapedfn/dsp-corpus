[19:38] <darksydephil> bought jazz jackrabbit, fucking thing just crashes nonstop and i dont have the know-how 
or patience to figure it out. fixes on the net are incredibly complicated 
[19:39] <thatanonyraccoon> the day the music died :( 

[19:39] <darksydephil> so that leaves Christmas Nights, and Merry Gear Solid, and maybe elf bowling if i can 

get a version that isn't virus-ridden which i've yet to find 

[19:39] <thatanonyraccoon> viscera cleanup detail is a gr8 game at least

map and not above your hp bar if the update is right that one thing i noticed btw 
[19:47] <eternia_forever> @Elipsion ahhh 

[19:47] <suckasurprise> did the stream start yet? It's not loading for me if it has 
[19:47] <poopshortsjr> No. 

[19:47] <poopshortsjr> It hasn’t started. 

[19:47] <suckasurprise> ok thanks 

[19:47] <poopshortsjr> Phil has to re-install PUBG. 

[19:48] <flyeaglesfly01> Trolls here before fans LUL 
[19:48] <poopshortsjr> I'm planning on starting the new SOK. 

[19:49] <poopshortsjr> I'm going to try to get into Phil's good graces, and then back stab him. 

[19:49] <darksydephil> okay well i deleted and reinstalled so 

[19:49] <darksydephil> not much else i can do, it doesn't say theres another update available 
[19:49] <darksydephil> time to get started!

[20:03] <originjm> pubg xbox servers are DOWN 

[20:03] <aworldofglazeddonuts> to be fair the Grinch only hated people he liked Christmas 
[20:03] <titsonasnake> the Christmas beepis cometh 
[20:03] <skooma_dealer> i hate people too 

[20:04] <kozatof> @darksydephil By this Bane means that he was a nobody until he took on the persona of 
Bane, the reputation that surrounds him is what has made him infamous. The "mask" is not the respiratory device 
that pumps him full of painkillers, the mask is his image as a dangerous individual known the world over for his 
exploits. From this we can draw parallels with Bruce Wayne and Batman, the mask is an important theme 
throughout. 

[20:04] <travisvincent> I'm an orphan so Christmas stinks for me 
[20:04] <captcaveman4201> phil buy the track suit lol $5 
[20:04] <minnowpause> bugged visiual mechanic s 

[20:04] <lightkunl988> Hey, no censoring @Skooma_Dealer ! He's funny af 
[20:04] <skooma_dealer> i found a dirty Christmas game 

[20:04] <kozatof> @darksydephil If I remove the mask, if I expose you as nothing more than a man will it 
destroy the essence of what you are? 

[20:04] <skooma_dealer> @Lightkunl988 <3 

[20:04] <kozatof> @darksydephil It would be a traumatic experience to abandon what I am, an existential crisis 
of sorts that would be difficult to recover from. 

[20:04] <goldencolts> NotLikeThis 
[20:04] <skooma_dealer> HOMO lone 
[20:04] <travisvincent> : A ) 

[20:04] <kozatof> You're an important person, your reputation is large and your deeds are noteworthy. 

[20:04] <goldencolts> koza posting truefilm discussion of the dark knight 
[20:04] <bentboxer> homo alone = ice 
[20:05] <solid_fantasy> How DARE you 

[20:05] <skooma_dealer> I found a dirty Christmas game., you have to aim the candy caine up santas asshole 
[20:05] <flyeaglesfly01> Can you mute people from chat? 

[20:05] <kozatof> @darksydephil For you I am an important person, you are an agent of the CIA who has been 
actively hunting me. Our importance to somebody, our stature, our largeness is defined by the effect we have on 
them. To the average person Bane is not a "big guy", but to this agent he is large indeed.
