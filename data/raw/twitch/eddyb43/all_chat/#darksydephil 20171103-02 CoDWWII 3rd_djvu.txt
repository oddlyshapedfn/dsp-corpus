terrible servers?

[20:12] <conky89> But if it had a beta available then it should have been fixed. That is the point of things like 
betas 

[20:12] <eternia_forever> not bad phil you did your part cheer25 

[20:13] <kuronbohanta> phils problem on fps games is that he camps too much or moves too slowly, need more 
mobility man

[20:13] <always_reeemember> @kuronbohanta thats a drastic change he’d have to struggle a lot to learn how to 
play aggressive, would be fun to watch but not for him (until he got good)

[22:05] <christianoveras> funny as hell 

[22:05] <damongoose42> okay you kno what? there ARE actually a lot of good looking textures, but the 
combination of poor textures and good ones just makes it visually obnoxious 
[22:05] <thesupervillain543> this game sucks 
[22:05] <christianoveras> woah 
*05J <^ 23 , habibi> 

[22:05] <nightbot> za habibi -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning] 

[22:06] <thesupervillain543> overwatch is so far ahead of its time 
[22:06] <neospartanhesperos9> @DaMongoose42 true 
[22:06] <fatestayjedi> overwatch is dying 
[22:06] <thesupervillain543> no the hell it isnt 
[22:06] <thesupervillain543> why do you say that 
[22:06] <fatestayjedi> yea it is 

[22:06] <johngaltwho> Over watch isn't dying but it sure isn't growing 
[22:06] <za_habibi> they were asterisks :( 

[22:06] <normonaut> TF2 was ahead of its time 

[22:06] <damongoose42> Overwatch will live on as GSGO has, 

[22:06] <bowlofbran> there was 225k ppl watching the world cup earlier 
[22:06] <pikkay> why I can't see if I got the 1100 cod points anywhere? 

[22:06] <christianoveras> Debate Round 1. Go! 



[22:06] <neospartanhesperos9> buddy system 

[22:06] <thesupervillain543> @fatestayjedi why did you say ow is dying 

[22:06] <johngaltwho> League of legends gets millions of views per championship game 

[22:06] <eternia_forever> @fatestayjedi say it is not so i just got it not to long ago and have not played it as of 

yet 

[22:06] <dolladalabill> +250K watching world cup = dying LUL 
[22:06] <damongoose42> this gams sucks, debate won 

[22:06] <adam_frostburn> @DarksydePhil Your weapons rpm is incredibly low, probably only 1 shot hit him. 
Use a faster gun 

[22:06] <thekinginyell0w> lag compensation should not exist, if you have the faster internet connection to the 

server then you should have the advantage, that's all there is to it 

[22:07] <christianoveras> lol 

[22:07] <christianoveras> Debate of Overwatch 

[22:07] <thesupervillain543> only thing about it thats dying are the original masters who are pissed because 

theyre not the only ones any more 

[22:07] <za_habibi> Has Phil seen Boku no Piko hentai? 

[22:07] <johngaltwho> Host advantage has always been a thing. Since Halo 2 at least. 

[22:07] <thesupervillain543> OW has a very toxic pretentious community 

[22:08] <johngaltwho> OW will never be as big as Smite or League and that's about all there is to it. They have 

their audience but it will never grow exponentially 

[22:08] <kozatof> @thesupervillain543 go see lol community 

[22:08] <neospartanhesperos9> @thesupervillain543 i've seen it 

[22:08] <adam_frostburn> Lul smite 

[22:08] <thesupervillain543> seen what 

[22:08] <christianoveras> @fatestayjedi ??? 

[22:08] <bowlofbran> FeelsAmazingMan DoritosChip YUM 
[22:08] <neospartanhesperos9> every online gaming community is bad 
[22:08] <thesupervillain543> true 
[22:08] <fatestayjedi> @christianoveras ??? 

[22:08] <neospartanhesperos9> unlesss it's Splatoons Kappa 
[22:08] <eternia_forever> lol 

[22:08] <johngaltwho> Left 4 Dead had an amazing community 
[22:08] <za_habibi> DSP, do you watch anime? 

[22:08] <eternia_forever> splatoon 

[22:08] <thesupervillain543> bunch of pretentious pricks who cant fuck a bitch but wanna be assholes on a video 
game 

[22:09] <christianoveras> ??? idk lol 

[22:09] <fatestayjedi> L4D and Killing Floor some of my fav communities 
[22:09] <kozatof> @thesupervillain543 sounds like league 

[22:09] <damongoose42> their slow and over complex bullet algerhythms, and complex particles could be 
slowing things down. 

[22:09] <thesupervillain543> lmao 

[22:09] <johngaltwho> I met some of my best friends to this day on left 4 dead 

[22:09] <eternia_forever> few more 

[22:09] <christianoveras> Never quit 

[22:09] <ugetcrushed> Could of been worse OSsloth gg 

[22:10] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[22:10] <johngaltwho> I almost had an affair with a married woman due to left 4 dead >_> 

[22:10] <brody_conley> So does dsp have a thing for kids? Like wasnt his fiance in highschool? 

[22:10] <thesupervillain543> this game SUCKS 

[22:10] <za_habibi> VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo 

[22:10] <eternia_forever> never say die its now or never 



[22:10] <thesupervillain543> thing is i think battlefront is about to be worse 
[22:10] <normonaut> Brody conley are you in 2010 still? such creativity 
[22:10] <neospartanhesperos9> this is nice, no bs perks, no wall running or high jumping 
[22:10] <christianoveras> This is how 

[22:10] <johngaltwho> Battlefront could be good if it learns from the first 
[22:10] <christianoveras> ... 

[22:10] <christianoveras> you do it. 

[22:10] <thesupervillain543> @JohnGaltWho did you play the beta 

[22:10] <christianoveras> lol 

[22:10] <johngaltwho> I did not 

[22:11] <thesupervillain543> it was very clunky 

[22:11] <thesupervillain543> they completely reworked the gameplay 

[22:11] <johngaltwho> Damn that doesn't make me feel any better 

[22:11] <kozatof> @johngaltwho battlefront 2 is p2w crap 

[22:11] <eternia_forever> true assassin 

[22:11] <damongoose42> I know Battlefront is gonna be worse, but i'm a starwars fan to the core so I am 
obligated to hope it isn’t 

[22:11] <christianoveras> That BAR is gonna fire like crazy 
[22:11] <thesupervillain543> feels like running through water 
[22:11] <eternia_forever> damin 

[22:11] <johngaltwho> @kozatof that describes every game at this point 
[22:11] <christianoveras> actually that's a nice amount of recoil 
[22:11] <kozatof> @johngaltwho shadow wars!! 

[22:11] <johngaltwho> lol look 
[22:11] <johngaltwho> lololol 

[22:11] <damongoose42> Also assassin’s creed is fixing to take a turn for the worse 
[22:12] <fasteddyy> when are you going to play zombies 

[22:12] <johngaltwho> I'm curious about origins. Not enough to drop sixty three bucks on it though 
[22:12] <thesupervillain543> @JohnGaltWho the first battlefront wasnt bad there just wasnt enough content 
[22:12] <christianoveras> When he plays zombies 
[22:12] <za_habibi> How many viewbots are in this chat? 

[22:12] <johngaltwho> Agreed. It needed a single player mode and nobody gave a shit about the die maps 
[22:12] <fatestayjedi> won’t he do the co op zombies as usual? 

[22:12] <flyeaglesfly01> @za_habibi 2 

[22:13] <christianoveras> Is Rey a Kenobi? or nah.... 

[22:13] <thesupervillain543> They could easily just take the build from the first battlefront and just implant all 

content from the original battlefront II and it wouldve been a classic 

[22:13] <ugetcrushed> That gun has so little recoil NotLikeThis 

[22:13] <eternia_forever> lol 

[22:13] <damongoose42> cuz cod 

[22:13] <thesupervillain543> but they rushed it because they needed to tie it into the movie 
[22:13] <thesupervillain543> greedy fucks 

[22:13] <johngaltwho> I went back and played battlefront 2. Doesn’t hold up as well as I thought it would 
[22:13] <thesupervillain543> damn 

[22:14] <thesupervillain543> i put in at least 100 hours of single player game play on that game 

[22:14] <thesupervillain543> on psp and ps2 

[22:14] <christianoveras> The BAR is the ACR of WW2 

[22:14] <johngaltwho> But then again I tried to go back and play Hitman 2 and I just cannot 
[22:14] <eternia_forever> gordons alive ? 

[22:14] <eternia_forever> hes pressing buttons 

[22:14] <johngaltwho> After Hitman 6 I can’t go back to those clunky bad controls 
[22:14] <thesupervillain543> true 



[22:14] <thesupervillain543> gaming has evolved 
[22:14] <thesupervillain543> from a mechanics perspective 
[22:15] <neospartanhesperos9> hitman ResidentSleeper 
[22:15] <johngaltwho> Even watching Phil play Spyro 
[22:15] <damongoose42> not fps's tjp 

[22:15] <thesupervillain543> but then innovation has dissipated immensely 

[22:15] <damongoose42> *tho 

[22:15] <christianoveras> bald headed badass 

[22:15] <johngaltwho> It didn’t look nearly as fun as I remember it 

[22:15] <materiaxsmasher> Phil im madly in love with you 

[22:15] <thesupervillain543> its sequel after fucking sequel these days 

[22:15] <christianoveras> Agent 47 

[22:15] <johngaltwho> They're safe. Just like movies 

[22:15] <thesupervillain543> Dark Souls was the last great franchise 

[22:15] <johngaltwho> Hello 47. Welcome to Paris. 

[22:15] <christianoveras> Hello Diana 

[22:16] <neospartanhesperos9> @materiaXsmasher you're mad 
[22:16] <christianoveras> lol 

[22:16] <johngaltwho> Agreed. I've put hundreds of hours into soulsborne. Such a good series. 

[22:16] <damongoose42> large developement companies are getting more and more corrupt 

[22:16] <za_habibi> Is DSP in a relationship? I heard he had a gf 

[22:16] <materiaxsmasher> i cant control my heart sorry 

[22:16] <thesupervillain543> Even last of us 

[22:16] <christianoveras> John Wick is the best assassin really 

[22:16] <johngaltwho> Small ones are corrupt too. Once they realize how easy it is to bleed suckers out of 

money they will all use loot boxes 

[22:16] <thesupervillain543> wasnt original 

[22:16] <thesupervillain543> great narrative 

[22:16] <fatestayjedi> loot boxes NotLikeThis 

[22:16] <christianoveras> The Equalizer is ok too 

[22:16] <thesupervillain543> but the gameplay was arkham and uncharted 

[22:17] <johngaltwho> Last of Us had boring gameplay but amazing graphics and atmospher and story 
[22:17] <thekinginyellOw> switch to a Sub machine Phil 
[22:17] <convertedclone> ... 

[22:17] <thesupervillain543> oh thats another great franchise Arkham series 

[22:17] <thekinginyellOw> haha he ran right into the mortar 

[22:17] <johngaltwho> Yeah I loved Arkham Knight despite the flaws. 

[22:17] <materiaxsmasher> EleGiggle 

[22:17] <christianoveras> Justice League November 17th! 

[22:17] <thesupervillain543> I fucked around and played through Arkham City in one sitting 

[22:17] <damongoose42> the cod team has clearly never heard of strategic spawn placement and directional map 

layouts 

[22:17] <johngaltwho> I've also gotten all the riddler trophies in every game. 

[22:17] <ugetcrushed> SeemsGood 

[22:18] <johngaltwho> Except origins 

[22:18] <thesupervillain543> damn thats tough 

[22:18] <thesupervillain543> yeah origins sucked 

[22:18] <thesupervillain543> shitty spin off 

[22:18] <thekinginyellOw> call that shit 

[22:18] <johngaltwho> I liked it 

[22:18] <christianoveras> Done? @DarksydePhil 

[22:18] <johngaltwho> I liked the story twist. Surprised me. 



[22:18] <young_wobblez> Shooting a teammate :/ 

[22:18] <young_wobblez> yikes 
[22:18] <yusukel4k> pigroach 
[22:18] <yusukel4k> lol 

[22:18] <thesupervillain543> i didnt like the copy and paste development 
[22:18] <johngaltwho> Fair enough. 

[22:18] <thesupervillain543> the walking dead by telltale was a good series 
[22:19] <za_habibi> DSP, how are you? I heard you broke up with your gf recently 
[22:19] <thesupervillain543> lacking in gameplay but narrative was some of the best ive ever seen 
[22:19] <christianoveras> @DarksydePhil Seeing Justice League? 

[22:19] <johngaltwho> It depresses me far too much. I made it to episode four and couldn't go on 
[22:19] <young_wobblez> @za_habibi Oh look a troll. 

[22:19] <thesupervillain543> i feel you 

[22:19] <johngaltwho> He's a weak ass troll 

[22:19] <alexander_rossi> just watch a cam rip on pirate bay phil 

[22:19] <damongoose42> IE not spawning players within a certain vacinity, or placing spawn areas on opposite 
sides of the map, with cover placed accordingly, nothing of that sort, its just a constant double reacharound 
clusterfuck 

[22:20] <young_wobblez> Did you get the FG 42 yet? 

[22:20] <thesupervillain543> whatre some other good franchises of the next gen? 

[22:20] <christianoveras> Understood. 

[22:20] <thesupervillain543> not many tbh 
[22:20] <eternia_forever> no mods ? 

[22:20] <johngaltwho> I don't like pointe du hoc much 
[22:20] <johngaltwho> Bioshock 
[22:20] <damongoose42> Life is strange, 

[22:20] <johngaltwho> Metro 2033 
[22:20] <thesupervillain543> Bioshock is a fucking 
[22:20] <christianoveras> Dashie 
[22:20] <thesupervillain543> classic 

[22:20] <neospartanhesperos9> actually, i didnt know about the breakup and asked on stream and got called out 
as a troll, i just dont spend time on twitter and in people's life so i didnt know and asked on stream. 

[22:20] <christianoveras> DashieGames 
[22:20] <thesupervillain543> top 10 game ever 
[22:21] <damongoose42> heavy rain 

[22:21] <young_wobblez> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Why would he even speak on that on stream? 

[22:21] <damongoose42> beyond two souls 

[22:21] <johngaltwho> @neospartanhesperos9 you probably asked when it was new. This is not news at this 
point 

[22:21] <thesupervillain543> mm heavy rain yes 
[22:21] <damongoose42> SHAWN 
[22:21] <johngaltwho> God of War 

[22:21] <christianoveras> Heavy Rain Taxidermist DLC was awesome 
[22:21] <young_wobblez> People can’t use critical thinking lol 

[22:21] <enigmatheory> wait a minute. I know I'm late but all of these games you guys are mentioning are last 
gen 

[22:21] <johngaltwho> JAY SOn 
[22:21] <enigmatheory> what am I missing? 

[22:21] <neospartanhesperos9> it was a month after actually, i skippd a lot of stream 

[22:21] <ygfourhundred> Wtf dsp is playing a multiplayer game? Fuck your single player games 

[22:21] <damongoose42> jaySON 

[22:21] <thesupervillain543> haha JAY SON 



[22:21] <za_habibi> yeah, I don’t have twitter, so I'm lost when it comes to streamers’ lives 
[22:21] <christianoveras> Never made a sequel to Heavy Rain 
[22:21] <christianoveras> ... 

[22:22] <damongoose42> json 

[22:22] <johngaltwho> Yeah true those are all last ten 
[22:22] <convertedclone> "believe me" 

[22:22] <johngaltwho> Gen 

[22:22] <johngaltwho> What about outlast? That's a good next gen series 
[22:22] <young_wobblez> Phil turn colour blind assist on 
[22:22] <christianoveras> Walking Dead by Telltale! 

[22:22] <thesupervillain543> mm outlast 

[22:22] <thesupervillain543> im here and there on outlast 

[22:22] <enigmatheory> @JohnGaltWho Cool, just making sure I was right about what we’re talking about xD 

[22:22] <johngaltwho> Walking Dead was on 360 

[22:22] <nightbot> President of cheese land just tipped $2.00 

[22:22] <young_wobblez> it helps you see red or green better on enimies and teammates 

[22:22] <christianoveras> A President 

[22:22] <damongoose42> mm just telltale games in general 

[22:22] <montlair> cant believe cod has so many games that all look and play the same, like wtf why cant they 

upgrade their graphics engine? every cod games looks 0.5% better 

[22:23] <johngaltwho> Telltale hasn't released any next gen only stuff have they? 

[22:23] <thesupervillain543> A truth 

[22:23] <enigmatheory> This gen? Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild 

[22:23] <thesupervillain543> no 

[22:23] <christianoveras> Sledgehammer knows best 

[22:23] <thesupervillain543> because their graphics can be run by an atari 

[22:23] <convertedclone> Jebaited 

[22:23] <damongoose42> the first couple walking dead games didn’t do too many groundbreaking things 
[22:23] <ijawd> this game is a camping simulator i swear 

[22:23] <johngaltwho> There really haven’t been any killer next gen games besides Mario and Zelda. That's 
depressing. 

[22:23] <thesupervillain543> yep 

[22:23] <christianoveras> Wii Sports 

[22:23] <damongoose42> ooh, Until Dawn 

[22:23] <thesupervillain543> and the new ones look like shit 

[22:23] <christianoveras> lolol 

[22:24] <damongoose42> Kholat, 

[22:24] <johngaltwho> Until Dawn is good. 

[22:24] <thesupervillain543> no until dawn was not innovative 
[22:24] <johngaltwho> I also love the Virtual Reality titles 

[22:24] <enigmatheory> @JohnGaltWho Seriously, this generation of gaming hasn’t been great. The only saving 
grace is that we can go back and play all of the amazing games we missed 
[22:24] <thesupervillain543> RE& 

[22:24] <thesupervillain543> *RE7

[22:24] <iloveashnastyO> Fuck call of DUDDDY 
[22:25] <johngaltwho> We Xbox folks got fucked 

[22:25] <damongoose42> Until Dawn used many phsychological horror affects that were the perfect FU to bs 
lazy jumscare horror fams 

[22:25] <neospartanhesperos9> VR doesnt seem to make anything better

[22:25] <enigmatheory> @IloveashnastyO Stil not working? Damn thats terrible 

[22:25] <damongoose42> *games 

[22:25] <christianoveras> refund 

[22:25] <johngaltwho> It's not better but certainly different. Immersive in a different way 
[22:25] <iloveashnastyO> Yeah man this is redic 
[22:25] <damongoose42> that too 

[22:25] <thesupervillain543> i was looking forward to we happy few until i saw its an open world game 
[22:25] <thesupervillain543> need to return to linear games with open world qualities 
[22:25] <thesupervillain543> those are the best 

[22:25] <johngaltwho> I have we happy few. The only good part is the intro 
[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> spawning twins 
[22:26] <johngaltwho> Yes I'm sick of open world 

[22:26] <convertedclone> "Nothing I could do", what a timeless catch phrase 
[22:26] <thesupervillain543> @JohnGaltWho its out? 

[22:26] <dantemustdiee> LUL 

[22:26] <damongoose42> SWTOR has Award winning cutscenes 

[22:26] <gamemaster8814> @za_habibi I hate to say it but he's gonna say no. 

[22:26] <enigmatheory> The problem is that the games listed "walking dead and Until dawn" both have great 

stories, but the gameplay is lackluster. Gameplay makes a game 

[22:26] <christianoveras> Who's taking the last shot? LeBron, Curry, MJ or Kobe? 

[22:26] <johngaltwho> Nauseated. Unless you're gonna be the witcher don’t bother. 

[22:26] <convertedclone> PJSalt 
[22:26] <eazybayke> LuL 
[22:26] <trihard41iife> I spawn I die 

[22:26] <dantemustdiee> shot from the back panic shooting his teammate xD doesnt get old 
[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> LUL 
[22:26] <eternia_forever> I aim Eye Die 

[22:26] <johngaltwho> @thesupervillain543 I was able to buy a preview copy for thirty bucks on Xbox 

[22:26] <thesupervillain543> Curry 

[22:26] <thekinginyellOw> this game really is trash 

[22:27] <sleepyreader> i spawn i die i spawn again 

[22:27] <convertedclone> ... 

[22:27] <dantemustdiee> lolololol 

[22:27] <damongoose42> Anyone else Starwars Knights of the old republic mmo trash? 

[22:27] <coreypending> melee wouldnt have killed anyway. 

[22:27] <trihard41iife> 2009 dsp hype 

[22:27] <za_habibi> @Gamemaster8814 should I donate more? I just really want them to finally meet 
[22:27] <johngaltwho> KOTOR is not an MMO nor is it trash 
[22:27] <damongoose42> how is it not an mmo? 

[22:27] <christianoveras> "Butt Buddy" -DSP 2017 

[22:27] <johngaltwho> Don’t confuse KOTOR with the old republic. Totally different. 

[22:27] <ijawd> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp 
[22:27] <tulliuscicero25> what a baby 

[22:27] <convertedclone> nah, 10 bits is enough for a response. You'll have to wait for the end of the match 
[22:27] <enigmatheory> KOTOR is one of the best works of art in gaming history 



[22:28] <gamemaster8814> @za_habibi That wont help, im pretty sure. 

[22:28] <damongoose42> NO I did not mean the original one 
[22:28] <enigmatheory> KOTOR - 10/10 
[22:28] <thesupervillain543> its call of duty 
[22:28] <trihard41iife> @za_habibi what did he say to ur dono 
[22:28] <johngaltwho> You mean the old republic lol 

[22:28] <christianoveras> @DarksydePhil Will wait on campaign and zombies! 

[22:28] <damongoose42> thats lit too tho 

[22:28] <thesupervillain543> why do we keep giving them a pass 
[22:28] <thesupervillain543> stop buying this shit 
[22:28] <damongoose42> @JohnGaltWho yeah ur right 
[22:28] <johngaltwho> I’m done buying games day one 

[22:28] <thekinginyellOw> you at a disadvantage cause your not in a dorm living on top of one another like 

hampsters, sharing the same internet connection... that's what this game is geared towards 

[22:28] <flyeaglesfly01> Advanced Warfare 

[22:28] <za_habibi> @TriHard4Liife nothing yet idt

[22:28] <johngaltwho> It's sad what we've come to as longtime faithful gamers. It's a joke now. 

[22:29] <neospartanhesperos9> i actually liked Ghosts CoolStoryBob 
[22:29] <damongoose42> oh. Fallout did a lot 
[22:29] <za_habibi> maybe he missed my donation 
[22:29] <dankmemeking840> they did multiplayer for mw3 as well 
[22:29] <sleepyreader> whats the purpose of the hub world? 

[22:29] <gdayguy36> I spawn, i die 

[22:29] <trihard41iife> @za_habibi well he doesn't have viewer count so 

[22:29] <convertedclone> nah, he’ll get to it. you sent 10 bits

[22:29] <thekinginyell0w> Like I said, the activision memo is... you at a disadvantage cause your not in a dorm
