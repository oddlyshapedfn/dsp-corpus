[12:11] <bethemadeagle> phil playing a 2 hour game :D the whole game is a movie as well 
[12:13] <channel33> am i still banned? 

[12:13] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Phil likes those games for commentary purposes 
[12:13] <channel33> nope cool 
[12:14] <channel33> dspWowdude 

[12:16] <thenewfaceofcreation> All i heard is"phil got a new gf 
[12:16] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi bethe 
[12:16] <thenewfaceofcreation> And im like wut 
[12:17] <bethemadeagle> yes phil got a new gf 
[12:17] <bethemadeagle> other than that no details 

[12:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> Interesting since she hasnt been with phil at thanksgiving 
[12:18] <bethemadeagle> and phil is playing hidden agenda a 2 hour game 
[12:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> Whats the name of the gf 
[12:19] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> new waifu probably spent it with her family 

[12:19] <bethemadeagle> phil cant see her as often as he wants to cause he streams all day and she cant see him 
late at night 

[12:19] <bethemadeagle> that is why he is going on break 

[12:19] <thenewfaceofcreation> He says he only met her like 3 times in what 

[12:19] <channel33> is the break today? 

[12:19] <thenewfaceofcreation> 5 months i guess 

[12:19] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> detractors think she's early 20’s 

[12:20] <bethemadeagle> the break is on the 5th of december 

[12:20] <thenewfaceofcreation> Well anyway. Congratz for phil i guess 

[12:20] <bethemadeagle> im sticking with my 27 for the age 

[12:20] <bethemadeagle> lol 

[12:20] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> I'll go with 25 

[12:20] <thenewfaceofcreation> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz wut. You serious? 

[12:21] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 26 maybe 

[12:21] <thenewfaceofcreation> I will go that she is a sex doll Kappa 
[12:21] <bethemadeagle> of course you would 

[12:21] <bethemadeagle> delta people were trolling and saying it was kate and phil said it wasnt 
[12:21] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @thenewfaceofcreation imported from Japan 
[12:22] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> ? 

[12:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> Kate? 

[12:22] <bethemadeagle> katexo from this chat 

[12:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz maybe?:p 
[12:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> Thats dumb 
[12:22] <bethemadeagle> it is 



[12:23] <thenewfaceofcreation> Whats the name of the gf then 

[12:23] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @bethemadeagle people came to that conclusion because she's here most of 
the time, knew Phil was available and what times he is away from streaming 
[12:24] <bethemadeagle> but she has said she has a boyfriend since last year 
[12:25] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> could from split and kept it quiet 

[12:26] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> anyways we’ll never know who she is nor is it any importance to us 
[12:26] <bethemadeagle> yup 

[12:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> Just dont ask about it when phil is around 
[12:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> Gtab for sure if you did 

[12:27] <thedoctor5437> i thi nk its better if we never know who she is. we have who will track all over the 
internet to find her information as soon as phil even shows her face, its too risky 
[12:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @thenewfaceofcreation he'll get cheers about the subject still 
[12:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> keep her off cam unless it's her idea 
[12:28] <craigbl498> the game hes gonna play looks good 

[12:28] <thenewfaceofcreation> Maybe have her talk but not showing her face nor name 

[12:28] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Learn from the mistakes with panda

[12:32] <thenewfaceofcreation> Dammit phone 

[12:32] <darksydephil> so anybody know if this game runs at 30 or 60fps? im going to assume 30 
[12:32] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Google buying Twitch? LUL LUL LUL 

[12:32] <bethemadeagle> jim i saw a playthrough it was 1 hour 40 so yes its 2 hours and it is like a interactive 2 
hour movie 

[12:33] <theycallmejimbob> you said the same about the last guardian BetheMadEagle dspHmm 
[12:33] <bethemadeagle> last guardian was a load of shit that dont count

[12:33] <blk_mage_ctype> Probably 30. 

[12:33] <thenewfaceofcreation> Ignored question dood 
[12:33] <bethemadeagle> this is a interactive detective movie 
[12:34] <thenewfaceofcreation> Oh well :p 

[12:34] <darksydephil> TheNewFaceofCreation your question is incredibly dumb, unless you think google is 
going to buy out all of amazon, who owns twitch 
[12:34] <darksydephil> why would i respond? 

[12:34] <segregate> @Aproxymate i remember when she was a normal streamer lmao 

[12:34] <aproxymate> @darksydephil do you know twitch employees are coming out that it is a toxic place to 
work? 

[12:34] <bethemadeagle> phil plans on playing hidden agenda for 2 full streams if he does that he would play the 

game fully 4 times jim 

[12:34] <majinboo3> I really hate that word 

[12:35] <majinboo3> "|Toxic"

[12:35] <darksydephil> jesus can i get some pertinent questions lol 
[12:35] <theycallmejimbob> is it a PS4 exclusive BetheMadEagle dspHmm

first place. Especially one that revolves around games. 

[12:35] <bethemadeagle> jim i dont know might be 
[12:35] <theycallmejimbob> Live SwiftRage 

[12:35] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil im asking for your opioion. Whats wrong with it 

[12:36] <aproxymate> Well even if you don’t work directly for twitch, it should be concerning that twitch might 

be negatively affected on the whole 

[12:36] <bethemadeagle> watching the youtube vids of raw to know whats happening and elias is singing :D 
[12:36] <theycallmejimbob> :o here we go VoHiYo

[14:23] <doctorzzz> WutFave 

[14:23] <superbatcat> The narrator is Darksy calling it 

[14:23] <channel33> then fought in the DOA tournament 

[14:23] <djrunol> @dukaduka oh sorry, i forgot they were scissoring all night 

[14:23] <dukaduka> @DJRunol i have no idea, it might be on of those converging choices 

[14:23] <chrishansenlulzz> lol 

[14:23] <tomahawkings> This agression cannot stand, man 
[14:23] <gola2222> The game looks god so far 
[14:23] <rockstar0182> Riggs is suspicious acting 
[14:24] <channel33> not for 60$ 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> we only have 1 hour and 25 minutes left boys and girls 
[14:24] <markymark52> this is $60? wow 
[14:24] <tiefblauxl7> It’s like $15 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> and this game is only 5 parts long 



[14:24] <blk_mage_ctype> cheer 10 When is Spider-Man going to get involved? Clearly he's going to be in this 
because he's narrating the story. I’d recognize that voice anywhere. 

[14:24] <a_lern> @markymark52 full price 
[14:24] <pikatits> i hope we see some scissors danK 
[14:24] <lord_dink> cool graphics 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> bobbi phil would never headbutt me i am loyal 

[14:24] <channel33> the killer is simon. Simon has a lack of emotional depth that makes me think he has some 

sick shit inside his head 

[14:24] <dukaduka> they really didn’t like him 

[14:24] <tiefblauxl7> It's $19.99 on PSN 

[14:24] <super_slade> I saw Lethal Weapon, Riggs is crazy 

[14:24] <channel33> o ok 

[14:24] <doctorzzz> well it has good gfx and replay value so price is ok 
[14:24] <lord_dink> i don't trust asian girls, she's probably the big bad of this game 
[14:24] <markymark52> @a_lern no it's not I just checked. 

[14:24] <channel33> the price is right! 

[14:24] <grsicki> COVER YOUR EYES CHILDREN KappaPride

[14:26] <channel33> SPIDERMAN vs RADY ORTON 

[14:26] <chairmancaleb> Lol, that's where I'm assuming the game will go. The trapper wil be the least 
unexpected person.

[16:39] <jii_el> @monkeydonkeyape the challenging aspect can be seen as obtaining a particular result at the 
head based on the decisions you make, and the fail state would be "failing" to detect the Real Criminal in this

[16:43] <myathebeez> I liked until dawn tho... 

[16:43] <celestialgoose> I don’t think I’d be buying this game. If most of it's stuff involves a quick time event on 
cutscenes.
