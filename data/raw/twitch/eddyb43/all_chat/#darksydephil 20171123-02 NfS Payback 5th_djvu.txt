[19:46] <garsoba> I question the person who made these 
[19:46] <weaponjay> Some of the songs are like what lol 

[19:46] <neospartanhesperos9> So was i suppose to laugh at people being cheated of their land and walking the 

path from East to OK with bleeding, frost bitten feet, no thanks 

[19:46] <thatanonybear> @WeaponJay i know, i can actually wake a joke LUL 

[19:47] <thatanonybear> i'm doin gr8 fam tsosWave 

[19:47] <niionkai> Is my time calculation wrong, or is the stream supposed to have started already? Just asking 
to be sure.

[19:47] <weaponjay> @thatanonybear I was talking to Neo

[19:47] <montiblanc> NotLikeThis 

[19:47] <weaponjay> No neo you don’t have to laugh 

[19:47] <kaixp> This is like waiting for an E3 conference 

[19:48] <neospartanhesperos9> My brain just doesn't understand how anyone could think that's funny, so why 
make the joke, but whatever 

[19:48] <niionkai> Sounds like I'm right and the stream is a bit late... hope everything's okay on his end. 

[19:48] <drdoc89> who let the soul's out 

[19:48] <weaponjay> I saw a gif on Twitter with Native Americans tipping a table over with a bunch of 
thanksgiving food over. I thought it was great

[20:07] <kozatof> When 

[20:07] <blk_mage_ctype> cheer50 Someone seriously needs to do a remix of the "By Lameos" song you sang. 
Those remixes you've been playing during prestream setup/breaks are hilarious and there's so much material 
folks could work with. 

[20:07] <jannedaarcl35> i worked all day too :/ 

[20:07] <kozatof> @darksydephil you should do hate live 

[20:07] <ornightz> I had toated Bread and Butter .... I have frozen Turkey but I don’t fucking know a thing bout 
cookin that giant fuckin bird , My late muther knew how to do that but she passed away during the summer sighs 

[20:07] <niionkai> @Blk_Mage_Ctype Funny enough, I thought of doing exactly that. 

[20:07] <garsoba> !cheerl5 Phil, I think if you took yourself less seriously with fighting games, it could really 
help, seems to be where the most negativity comes from and probably most of the bans you do with your channel 
(Lol) 

[20:07] <coralguy> Yeah it beats the family coming over and clogging the shitter again 

[20:07] <garsoba> welk.thta didnt work

[20:08] <garsoba> cheerl5 Phil, I think if you took yourself less seriously with fighting games, it could really 
help, seems to be where the most negativity comes from and probably most of the bans you do with your channel 
(Lol)

[20:10] <kozatof> @darksydephil I made a hobos and dogs song for you from bully 

[20:10] <kozatof> Can you add it 

[20:10] <neospartanhesperos9> Canola oil DansGame 

[20:10] <suckasurprise> Phil’s fighting game streams are the best 

[20:10] <encelor> @kozatof send to his email 

[20:10] <kozatof> Please Phillips add my remix 

[20:10] <jannedaarcl35> Those people died out though :) 

[20:10] <theshadowl9872> no Phil I don’t want to hurt you Phil 

[20:10] <encelor> @DarksydePhil its not because they fucked up its because they can get attention from people 
that hate you 

[20:10] <paddingtonbearl87> lmao wow phil xecl 
[20:10] <encelor> attentionsluts 

[20:10] <cailancook> Hang in there Phil, things WILL get better 
[20:11] <jannedaarcl35> SoK is goneee 

[20:11] <niionkai> Phil, you have a huge support group, just look at this chat. You wouldn’t end up in a box. 

[20:11] <kozatof> Hey phil huge fan darksydephil I made a hobos and dogs song for you from bully 

[20:11] <hands_celebratory> lol 

[20:11] <encelor> and phil is easy to troll 

[20:11] <encelor> forgot that 

[20:11] <garsoba> yeah, at worst he’d be living in a corrugated cardboard box and people would play with his ball 
[20:11] <garsoba> ss 

[20:11] <theshadowl9872> easy to troll yes yes he is 
[20:12] <encelor> and phil does contradic him self a lot 
[20:12] <niionkai> Honestly, I really think Phil will be fine. 

[20:12] <fli2017> dont crash lol 
[20:12] <encelor> lacT 

[20:12] <neospartanhesperos9> Just cause SoK is dissolved doesn’t mean there aren't people still out there to 
carry out the objective. Look at IS and every other group- dissolved and someone always tries to rebuild or put 
back together the scraps 

[20:12] <kozatof> How are we supposed to send phil the remix song 
[20:12] <encelor> @kozatof his email 

[20:12] <thatanonybear> @kozatof upload to youtube then email him 

[20:12] <niionkai> @kozatof Good question, I think he has his email on his YouTube. 

[20:12] <kozatof> It is uploaded 

[20:12] <bentboxer> honor system? thats so 60's woman 
[20:13] <encelor> LUL 

[20:13] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 exactly, people would love to copy SOK and start a new group 
for harassing DSP 

[20:13] <kozatof> @darksydephil I sent you an email about a remix song you can add to prestream 
[20:13] <garsoba> i dont think anyone would dedicate the same amount of resources that SoK did 
[20:13] <encelor> sllverWut lacJ2 



[20:13] <garsoba> anyone else, that is 

[20:13] <thatanonybear> @garsoba there's a lot of creeps out there 
[20:13] <paddingtonbearl87> @garsobaud be surprised 

[20:13] <neospartanhesperos9> @ThatAnonyBear right, it sounds fucked up but it's happened before 
[20:14] <encelor> SoK remnants still take their time 
[20:14] <encelor> they rpolly changed name 
[20:14] <hands_celebratory> LUL 

[20:14] <cailancook> What was SoK's reason for 'disbanding' then? They just give up? 

[20:14] <encelor> most of them hoped to lacPride 
[20:14] <bentboxer> does anyone smell any bacon 

[20:14] <niionkai> Bleh, who cares about them other than to laugh at the hypocrisy? They're lolcows now.

[20:17] <kozatof> Konichwa Greetings from japan dsp-kun, darksydephil I sent you an email about a remix song 

you can add to prestream 

[20:17] <garsoba> i know, was kidding lol 

[20:17] <niionkai> @Gutty333 I would be too. I suspect a cool restaurant of family recipes is a safe bet. He did 
mention it at one point. 

[20:17] <paddingtonbearl87> quite the MOUF ON YA EntropyWins 

[20:17] <encelor> no loli's allowed either 

[20:17] <drilbit777> @encelor KonCha 

[20:17] <encelor> don't want chris hanson on me 

[20:17] <jannedaarcl35> Phil can always switch to an exclusive cooking with the king format :p 
[20:17] <kozatof> Hmmmm 

[20:18] <mokujin> why is he so salty over SFV. seems like there's an underlying issue. 

[20:18] <rbrezay> hey phil can you compare need for speed or forza? 

[20:18] <encelor> hey drilbit777 

[20:18] <gutty333> @Niionkai but how realistic is that vision becoming. It seems to me he is just riding this as 
long as possible. 

[20:18] <kozatof> Ey dsburnell. I made a REMIX SONG for you to add to PRESTREAM 
[20:18] <bentboxer> phil's fans will grow up have disposable income and donate to him, he's alright 
[20:18] <encelor> lacP hi encelor please take a seat sllverWut oh shitoo 
[20:18] <cailancook> @Mokujin Can confirm. SFV is just a shit game. 

[20:18] <paddingtonbearl87> @gutty333 real talk 

[20:18] <neospartanhesperos9> the license plate says 'ZEP', i feel like finishing that and saying 'ZEPHYR' 

[20:18] <niionkai> @Gutty333 I honestly couldn’t tell you. I've never opened a restaurant, so it really depends on 
the scaling, planning, and savings for it. 

[20:18] <paddingtonbearl87> shitty tur boh 
[20:18] <drilbit777> How have you been? @encelor 
[20:19] <encelor> good man you? 

[20:19] <bentboxer> restaurants have 75 percent fail rate 
[20:19] <rbrezay> mvc i is alson a flop, venmon sounds weird 

[20:19] <niionkai> *shrug* I know some people who have succeeded. Seemed pretty safe to me if you can keep 
it clean and simple. 

[20:19] <kozatof> HUGE FAN HUUUUGE Hey phil huge fan darksydephil I made a hobos and dogs song for 
you from bully 

[20:20] <kozatof> Leta€™s see if he sees that 
[20:20] <encelor> prolly not 
[20:20] <kozatof> He will 

[20:20] <jannedaarcl35> That could be his resteraunt name, "Cooking with the King" 

[20:20] <gutty333> @bentboxer yep that is true, also more cost associated with it. The most realistic scenario is 
he might ride the wave and cross fingers the loyal fans can still be there for the long haul.

you sleepy 

[20:24] <d_3rpin> but the car movements in paradise seemed a bit more fluid 
[20:24] <niionkai> Just reading that tells me this is going to be hard... 

[20:24] <d_3rpin> is there a road rage mode in this game?
