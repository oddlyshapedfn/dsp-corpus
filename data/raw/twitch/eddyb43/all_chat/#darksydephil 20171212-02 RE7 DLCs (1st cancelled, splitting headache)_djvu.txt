[10:53] <josephine_thompson> Its Death Grips! Courtesy of yours truly 
[10:54] <themahirotheorem> Greed is... MASSIVELY STRONG 

[10:55] <josephine_thompson> If someone had the username "ipreferapenne" would they get banned?

[10:56] <themahirotheorem> His chats must be full of them 



[10:57] <thenewfaceofcreation> full of what 

[10:57] <themahirotheorem> Ita€™s why he blocked comments on YouTube 

[10:58] <themahirotheorem> The comments reference things hea€™s said in the past 

[10:58] <xsade234> Would think blocking comments would have a negative effect on your search ranking 

[10:58] <themahirotheorem> People post stuff on his Instagram too 

[10:58] <themahirotheorem> It does. Hea€™s killing his own channels 

[10:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> ko gaming is dead, his vlog channel is dead

[11:45] <josephine_thompson> Glad you prefaced it with gently 
[11:46] <josephine_thompson> As opposed to violently :0 
[11:46] <bethelewd> gentle is not in my nature i like it RUFF 

[11:46] <themahirotheorem> If he doesna€™t respond drag him out of bed with a full nelson 

[11:46] <themahirotheorem> Then take him to suplex city 

[11:47] <bethelewd> i will do the coup de grace on him 

[11:47] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> give him the samoan spike 

[11:47] <bethelewd> but that would knock him out more 

[11:48] <themahirotheorem> Imagine Undertaker coming out of retirement just to give phil a last ride 
powerbomb

[11:48] <bethelewd> who says taker is retired NO ONE confirmed nor denied 
[11:48] <themahirotheorem> There are rumors of a match with Sting, yeah

[11:49] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> only thing that would wake phil up is a side boob pic from his red head 
NotATK 

[11:49] <bethelewd> that was rumored as soon as sting came to wwe 
[11:49] <bethelewd> nah that wouldnt wake phil 
[11:50] <media_snob> Good afternoon friends. 

[11:50] <themahirotheorem> I aina€™t got no side boob, but I do got some side poop. Ia€™ll serve him a 
bedpan filled with a hot lunch. 

[11:50] <bethelewd> he needs a full body pic with x on the nips and a thong

[11:52] <themahirotheorem> Bows head 

[11:53] * bethelewd tips his top hat 

[11:53] <gamemaster2003isdead> i will not bow 

[11:53] <themahirotheorem> How do I do that 

[11:53] <media_snob> @gamemaster2003isdead That's okay, nobody wanted to be here for you anyway. Just 
like your father. 

[11:53] <bethelewd> bow or suffer the lewd

[11:55] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> these overwatch skins are shit except for junkrat and sombra 

[11:55] <media_snob> So weird that I was thinking about Phil in juggalo makeup earlier. That should have been 

his halloween costume. 

[11:55] <themahirotheorem> I bet phil owns every icp album 
[11:55] <bethelewd> secretly goes around with his pimp cane 
[11:55] <josephine_thompson> Plot Twist: Phil has a hatchetman tattoo on his back 

[11:56] <media_snob> Plot Twist: All of his debts are really a result of severe crystal meth addiction, like your 
typical juggalo.

stream."

[12:22] <bethelewd> you sit on your hand until it goes numb then jack off 

[12:22] <media_snob> @encelor Lol, well the drugs I use fuck up the blood circulation in my arm. So it takes 
like 20 minutes to find a position not too painful to pass out in.

Netherlands to spend the week with him while claiming he can't afford his bills? 

[16:32] <media_snob> His drinking stream was yesterday? 

[16:33] <media_snob> josbornicus ain't nobody trying to get banned for that shit.

[17:57] <bausleyfred> music slaps 

[17:57] <pray4rock> FBtouchdown 

[17:57] <assassinaltair7> Real music 

[17:57] <blue_blur64> I love that TD emote 

[17:58] <darksydephil> oh you mean theo pop-up 

[17:58] <darksydephil> yeah the popups dont have emotes haha 

[17:58] <blue_blur64> :P 

[17:58] <damntobi> o/ 

[17:58] <assassinaltair7> When is bloodborne redemption run 

[17:58] <blue_blur64> So anyone else watching the Alabama polls right now? D: 

[17:58] <media_snob> Stream stuttering for anyone else? 

[17:58] <media_snob> Yeah blue blur. 

[17:59] <thankyoumrfriberg> @blue_blur64 me TriHard / monkaS 
[17:59] <blue_blur64> I'm scared brownSCARED 
[17:59] <jjbx22> pubg when 

[17:59] <media_snob> I'm not. I don’t have to live in Alabama. OpieOP 
[17:59] <pray4rock> pubg hype GTChimp FBpenalty 
[17:59] <imbadatdota2> i love u phil 

[17:59] <blue_blur64> But it affects the US though Media (I live in NY) 

[17:59] <assassinaltair7> Pubg is awesome 
[17:59] <majinboo3> Phil you ready for that P?UBG? 

[17:59] <jbowler21> what's pubg guys? 

[17:59] <thankyoumrfriberg> KKona I voted for Moore 

[18:00] <media_snob> The senate technically. Not enough to tip the majority. 

[18:00] <blue_blur64> @jbowler21 Player's Unknown BattleGrounds 
[18:00] <reloaded211> Singing with DSP! 

[18:00] <jbowler21> oh 

[18:00] <majinboo3> I want moore to win just to see the meltdown 
[18:00] <blue_blur64> Not that kind of affect media 
[18:00] <ass_blastor> Does Phil have an Xbox IX? 

[18:00] <assassinaltair7> No 

[18:01] <media_snob> Well, I'll always bet on the south to do some stupid shit. Especially having lived there 
once in my life. 

[18:01] <blue_blur64> It’ll affect how people outside the US view us overall, making it seem that we support the 
kind of person Moore is (allegedly but blatently obvious who he is) 

[18:01] <ass_blastor> he might have framerate issues with regular xbox on PUBG 
[18:01] <assassinaltair7> X only gives like 5 extra FPS 

[18:01] <media_snob> Electing a pedophile is like small potatoes in comparison. Especially when you had 
someone like David Duke holding office at one time. 

[18:01] <blue_blur64> who? 

[18:02] <wint3rmu7e> dsp with the hot freestyle 

[18:02] <majinboo3> too be honest most of the world is ass outside the us 

[18:02] <media_snob> White Supremacy, former Klan Grand Wizard. Was elected in Louisiana during the early 
90s IIRC. 

[18:02] <assassinaltair7> People dona€™t realise pubg isna€™t finished yet and they are trying to find a way to 
get it to 60fps 

[18:02] <blue_blur64> Well now I know why I don’t know him, I was born in 94 brownLUL 
[18:03] <zahvone> The music gets better everytime. 

[18:03] <media_snob> The people of the south aren’t exactly the brightest bulbs. Nor the most socially correctly. 



MingLee 

[18:03] <majinboo3> Also alabama is one of the most conservative states 
[18:03] <majinboo3> they will NEVER elect a democrat 

[18:03] <media_snob> Treating people with decency? Not molesting kids? What are you, one of the gays? 
[18:03] <blue_blur64> Hey, I follow youtubers that are pretty smart and live in Alabama DansGame 
[18:03] <thankyoumrfriberg> The election of a pedophile is not that much of a big deal because for the most 
part, most of the world’s government and elite are involved in secrecy surrounding children, drugs, sex 
trafficking etc. 

[18:03] <covetedseraph> So majinboo? 

[18:03] <assassinaltair7> When is the stream starting 
[18:03] <covetedseraph> That's the people's choice. 

[18:04] <majinboo3> same with Washington and democrats 

[18:04] <wint3rmu7e> most places dominated by religion arent generally too bright 

[18:04] <media_snob> At least they have the decency to pretend to hide the shit. MingLee 

[18:04] <majinboo3> Washington will always vote democrat but funny enough only Seattle is liberal in 

Washington 

[18:04] <majinboo3> but Seattle is also by far has the highest population in Washington 

[18:04] <ihav4gotn> dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp dspWowdude 

[18:04] <ass_blastor> i thought stream started at 6. Is it changed to regular 7:30 PM? 

[18:04] <media_snob> Except for retards like Anthony "Show You My" Weiner 

[18:04] <wint3rmu7e> i live in Seattle and there are way too many far left assholes everywhere 

[18:04] <katexo234> TPFufun 

[18:04] <blue_blur64> @thankyoumrfriberg More than just that though, there's also many comments he made 
(like getting rid of all the amendments after the 10th) 

[18:05] <majinboo3> Sounds good to me 

[18:05] <wint3rmu7e> thankfully there is tons of hood guys to balance it out 

[18:05] <thankyoumrfriberg> Dude my boy Moore talking about getting rid of the 13th amendment got me 
spooked TriHard 

[18:05] <majinboo3> Republicans are all savages 
[18:05] <majinboo3> they legit dont give a fuck 
[18:06] <media_snob> MingLee 

[18:06] <media_snob> @thankyoumrfriberg It's a states rights issue my colored friend. 

[18:06] <blue_blur64> Ok, I think we should take a break from the politics since he's about to start talking I'm 
assuming since no music is playing 

[18:06] <media_snob> Now get out of my town, it's 9 o’clock boy.

[18:08] <navels2> How much did you pay your "girlfriend" aka escort to stay with you over the long weekend?

[18:08] <control lerhog> airport detractor confirmed 

[18:08] <majinboo3> navel why would he pay an ESCORT from across the planet when he could just hire a

[18:09] <thankyoumrfriberg> ANELE sorry 

[18:09] <media_snob> Those police stings ain't no joke famo. 

[18:09] <wint3rmu7e> what bullshit airline was this? 

[18:09] <sirnoblex> Damin 

[18:09] <the_kimherlie_hrink> Probably Delta 

[18:09] <cardiacofficer> Usually they accommodate but it depends on the airline. 

[18:09] <sirnoblex> RIP 

[18:09] <vendatus> Jamaica Air TriHard 

[18:09] <katexo234> must be spirit Airlines LUL LUL LUL

[18:10] <freakout389> You do realize there is a lot going into letting a plane leave with hundreds of people on it 
rather than "If people do their JOB" You child 
[18:10] <tantamounter> vohiyo 150 
[18:10] <riley_212> What up 

[18:10] <media_snob> markymark isn't a troll, he's a regular MingLee 
[18:10] <media_snob> Just saying. 

[18:10] <control lerhog> ill comeback after this lore is over 

[18:11] <thankyoumrfriberg> All airlines are shitty and have fuck all service because the government and big 
companies don’t want people to travel or move around so that they become stuck in one place and have a limited 
education and salary. This is more than just an airline's misguidance/misconduct. 

[18:11] <chaosmiku> the nsa did 911 

[18:11] <majinboo3> That was legit the dumbest shit i have ever read 
[18:11] <majinboo3> and doesnt even make logical sense 



[18:11] <thankyoumrfriberg> Logical sense is a patriarchy 
[18:11] <media_snob> Mmm, again. No comment.

compensation back 

[18:23] <ben_megaman> It’d be cool to know what sort of games his new GF plays; I’d assume at least some are

mean LUL

[18:55] <pcgamehunter> The virus makes everyone have subtitles Kappa 
[18:55] <mickjones90> because Lucas was working for Umbrella 
[18:55] <the_elusiveone45> DSP playing PUBG on Xbone will be hilarious. 

[18:55] <the_elusiveone45> The hardware runs it like total dogshit 
[18:55] <pcgamehunter> Phug that 
[18:55] <londorgael> whatever 

[18:55] <assassinaltair7> Why would there be racist little kids on pubg lol 

[18:56] <media_snob> It looks like one of those budget games your grandma buys you because it's a video game, 
and you said you wanted a video game. 

[18:56] <kinggoken> thats just how it is 
[18:56] <pinkdam> cos pubg is the new cod 
[18:56] <kinggoken> A 

[18:56] <threedog64> Yeah especially on Xbone 

[18:56] <pcgamehunter> Chris is skeptical working for the company that releases a virus as often as Apple does 
iPhones? You don't say LUL 



[18:56] <threedog64> Why??? 

[18:56] <the_elusiveone45> @Media_Snob Especially since it's an early access title, lol 
[18:56] <assassinaltair7> Ia€™m enjoying it on Xbox 
[18:56] <londorgael> apple releases a new iphone every year? 

[18:56] <londorgael> thats normal 
[18:57] <the_elusiveone45> Clowns

[18:57] <dante_must_die_> lol 
[18:57] <kzaion> you're putting items in... 

[18:57] <pinkdam> don’t save too often you don’t want to run out of magnetic ribbons 
[18:57] <howlingwolfjoey> Glad everyone stopped talking about mario. and i’m glad it didn’t get GotY.

[18:57] <cte900> is the desert map on xbone? 

[18:57] <infantyellow> thats a yt shot 

[18:57] <assassinaltair7> Anyone excited for the devil May Cry hd collection coming to PS4? 

[18:57] <pcgamehunter> no 
[18:58] <howlingwolfjoey> no 

[18:58] <kinggoken> how come pubg on Xbone isn't 60fps? 

[18:58] <pcgamehunter> I wonder Kappa 

[18:58] <kinggoken> i would be excited for it if I didn’t already have it on ps3 @AssassinAltair7 

[18:58] <media_snob> Because you need the Xbox One X goy, now avaiable at a gamestop near you. 

[18:58] <blue_blur64> Because it's still an early access game on Xbox One 

[18:58] <serpentunderneath> I hate when games make you read 

[18:58] <pcgamehunter> Pretty sure even Xbox X can’t run it Kappa 

[18:58] <the_elusiveone45> @Kinggoken Xbone One's hardware is crap. 

[18:58] <pinkdam> but it's not even 30fps on xbox one x 
[18:58] <pcgamehunter> "Early access" OpieOP 
[18:58] <rebel_uccidere> Kappa 
[18:58] <vendatus> it's 30 on lx LUL 

[18:58] <media_snob> Shh, give it time goy. It's still early access. They're going to make it 60 fps. Kappa 
[18:58] <the_elusiveone45> maybe PUBG on consoles isn’t such a good idea. 

[18:58] <kinggoken> its disappointing they couldn’t get pubg 60fps on console 
[18:58] <pcgamehunter> "Shermly Shmacksess" 

[18:58] <pcgamehunter> Keepo 

[18:59] <doomtrain84> anyone else ejoying a nice spliff of some good old weed? 

[18:59] <thatanonyraccoon> @The_ElusiveOne45 it's probably more the software's fault, being a massively 
underdeveloped game 

[18:59] <assassinaltair7> It has to be 30fps on x because of Xbox one original players 
[18:59] <mickjones90> PUBG is meant to played on PC, xbone is a shit console tbh 
[18:59] <thatanonyraccoon> it can't see it being optimized much if at all 
[18:59] <serpentunderneath> I love good old weed 



[18:59] <assassinaltair7> PS4 is barely better theya€™re both okay 

[18:59] <pcgamehunter> PUBG is meant to be deleted along with the rest of steam greenlight Kappa 
[18:59] <thatanonyraccoon> and i dont even like xbone 
[18:59] <threedog64> Xbone is trash 

[18:59] <pcgamehunter> Yeah you should like it racoon you're both trash so Kappa 
[18:59] <media_snob> Xbone has all the best exclusive, like Forza, and... 

[18:59] <the_elusiveone45> I forgot Xbox One was still a thing. It's completely irrelelvant these days, IMO. 
[18:59] <thatanonyraccoon> WOOOW 
[18:59] <media_snob> ...Forza. 

[19:00] <thatanonyraccoon> im hurt, pc 

[19:00] <aragorio> Nobody likes Xbone and has a valid reason to do so 
[19:00] <pcgamehunter> @Media_Snob MingLee 
[19:00] <kinggoken> Xbone has Gears and Halo :) 

[19:00] <the_elusiveone45> The Switch will probably pass it in sales in a few years. 

[19:00] <kzaion> Steroids PogChamp 

[19:00] <azathothcult> they call it the xbone because it's the one console you don’t want 
[19:00] <assassinaltair7> Xbox is great I like it as much as my PS4 and pc 

[19:00] <micgelo09> @DarksydePhil bet umbrella is gonna kill ethan after they interrogate him OR make a die 
where he escapes umbrella 

[19:00] <pcgamehunter> @ThatAnonyRaccoon awww don't feel bad, have a half eaten candy bar Kappa 
[19:00] <dee2cee> yeee roids, get chris back to normal 
[19:00] <kzaion> Get Chris back on the roids 

[19:00] <the_elusiveone45> the 360 was a great console. Xbone is trash 
[19:00] <kinggoken> Switch will definitely pass Xbone in sales 
[19:00] <threedog64> Forza and (Awkward Silence) 

[19:00] * thatanonyraccoon nibbles the candy bar 

[19:00] <ass_blastor> cheerlO Did you buy any bitcoin or litecoin? 

[19:00] <dante_must_die_> most of the xbox exclusives are released on pc as well 
[19:00] <kinggoken> Forza, Gears and Halo :) 

[19:00] <dante_must_die_> no reason to get one really 

[19:00] <blue_blur64> Well seeing as how it already passed 10 million units sold @Kinggoken , I think it's 
obvious :P 

[19:00] <chmf030> Drop the files. 

[19:00] <assassinaltair7> Cuphead and pubg are console exclusives 

[19:00] <clunkyd> Why is nobody blaming the devs? A game that looks like last gen and cant even have steady 
30fps. LOL 

[19:01] <threedog64> Wtf 

[19:01] <katexo234> oh shit WutFace WutFace 

[19:01] <blue_blur64> But they're on PC too Assassin 

[19:01] <kinggoken> the devs are to busy swimming in money to make their game run silky smooth on consoles 
[19:01] <assassinaltair7> Console exclusive 

[19:01] <media_snob> His tax attorney in Connecticut low key swiped his bitcoins. 

[19:01] <pcgamehunter> Um you know the last two xbox exlusives this year are for kinect and some garbage and 
one came out like 4 months ago 

[19:01] <chmf030> They only take space in the inventory.

[19:01] <thatanonyraccoon> i think you can buy a partial bitcoin

sides. 

[19:19] <thatanonyraccoon> @majinboo3 when you’re running against Roy Moore, your campaign should be 
pretty easy

RE Fans who have been dissatisfied with the direction the series has been going.

[20:52] <pinkdam> he was blocking dude 

[20:53] <kushiyakitori> this isn't really a logical series so i dont think its a good idea to go hunting for logic here 
[20:53] <micgelo09> @DarksydePhil everything in resident evil biohazard is taking place before resident evil 1 
umbrella also specialized in viruses whoever made this seems more of a mold and umbrella couldve tried to take 
it for themselves 

[20:53] <bausleyfred> blame the game. Yaaaaas 

[20:53] <cte900> lol 

[20:53] <sundekal2> here we go again 

[20:53] <mose2118> I dunno, not feeling it, but thanks for mansplaining 
[20:54] <mose2118> @Micgelo09 see above 
[20:54] <threedog64> Get turned on 

[20:55] <dukaduka> this is an accurate representation of how it's like to live in the south 
[20:55] <emperorscrub> Those things are quite attractive 

[20:55] <thatanonyraccoon> yeah, some lumber was processed and made into a box 
[20:55] <thatanonyraccoon> then the box had a branch put in it 
[20:55] <emperorscrub> lrnao

[20:56] <concretecasket> ooo right in the balls 

[20:57] <mose2118> Why did 'realistic graphics' replace interesting or even common sense story? 

[20:57] <thecrowl21684> is he saying rabbit or rapid punches? 

[20:57] <emperorscrub> I thought i saw a slit between those legs 
[20:57] <cte900> when has RE ever been common sense? 

[20:58] <micgelo09> @mose2118 think about it didnt all this happen before the outbreaks in other countries 
because otherwise ethan wouldve been just trying to survive where he was and not come to save mia? 

[20:58] <concretecasket> hahaha @Emperorscrub 

[20:58] <demilorde> you get a tree branch u get a tree branch every 1 gets a tree branch 
[20:58] <thatanonyraccoon> @mose2118 +1 

[20:58] <thecrowl21684> if he's saying rabbit punches hes completely wrong 
[20:58] <thecrowl21684> rabbit punches are to the back of the head 
[20:59] * bethelewd hugs coon lovingly 

[20:59] <sethl89> How is this one more boring than the Chris one

[20:59] <mose2118> @CTE900 But RE5 was really awesome with way crappier graphical power 
[20:59] <bethelewd> :)

likes it 

[21:09] <gutty333> is he playing pubg tonight? 

[21:09] <georgetdawson> yes 

[21:09] <sethl89> He might George he plays fighter games a lot when they come out and multiplayer shooters

[21:13] <cazzacl> Ajit Pai is a good man with a wife and kids 
[21:13] <sethl89> No he is not 

[21:13] <jv5_guy> Capcom should release res evil boxing 

[21:13] <forcexkin> Are you going to be playing Super Mario Sunshine today? 

[21:13] <madibased> Any beginner traps in this DLC? 

[21:13] <sethl89> He says net neutrality hurts the sick....what a joke of a man 

[21:13] <thatanonyraccoon> @Sk8rSlim it's def not specific to your region, people in other continents have 
mentioned problems 

[21:14] <sethl89> Nope, you kill everything with ur fist

[21:14] <leewanner> Hahaha Panclarks??? 

[21:14] <jv5 guy> Netneutrality is what keeps many sites alive 
[21:14] <sethl89> A 

[21:14] <cazzac 1> net neutrality isn’t that bad guys 
[21:15] <fallenl570> A 

[21:15] <sethl89> Exactly, that's why like 98% of the internet wants to keep it 
[21:15] <thatanonyraccoon> i haven’t heard someone who isn’t a millionaire defend net neutrality 
[21:15] <madibased> What you drinking @darksydephil 
[21:15] <thatanonyraccoon> i think i have that backwards 

[21:15] <sethl89> Net neutrality is what keeps us from getting buttfucked by corporations 
[21:15] <jv5_guy> The other 2% needs to fuk off 
[21:15] <sethl89> Yeah coon lol 
[21:15] <sethl89> Exactly 

[21:15] <thenewfaceofcreation> You trolling right 
[21:15] <emperorscrub> Make some shoes out dem gadas 
[21:15] <thatanonyraccoon> yeah, lol

[21:16] <f_on_yo_bit> how much longer till he plays pubg? 

[21:16] <sethl89> Cazzac ur bad b8 
[21:16] <leewanner> Is this a boxing game? 

[21:17] <jv5_guy> Letjust hope dec 14th is the win for the internet 
[21:17] <thatanonyraccoon> @LeeWanner Resident Evil Punch Out 

[21:17] <sethl89> Why would anyone want to pay more for the service they already are currently using. It's 
literally a waste of money 

[21:17] <kingwhiterabbit> When's the PUBG stream? 

[21:17] <sethl89> After this die hopefully 

[21:17] <clunkyd> its too late for that 

[21:17] <georgetdawson> whats happening on the 14th? 

[21:17] <kingwhiterabbit> Any estimate on how much longer he has to beat this? 

[21:17] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi there btw 

[21:17] <sethl89> The vote to keep or abolish net neutrality 

[21:17] <sethl89> Hey face 

[21:17] <chairmancaleb> @Sethl89 Right now, that's all hear say. Nothing is confirmed. 

[21:18] <thatanonyraccoon> @georgetdawson either nothing, or your internet is ruined forever 

[21:18] <sk8rslim> companies already came out said theyre ready to charge for fast lines if it gets repealed 

[21:18] <thatanonyraccoon> make your choise 

[21:18] <jv5_guy> Brw we already pay 4 internet by our providers so y pay more 
[21:18] <forcexkin> BUGGED MELEE 

[21:18] <cazzacl> you really need packaged internet i mean Pajit is right some people pay for access to internet 

that they dont use some people will save money 

[21:18] <sethl89> It's not hear say man what u talking about 

[21:18] <forcexkin> DOOD 

[21:18] <leewanner> People worried about the removal of Net Neutrality must not know that there was no such 
thing before 2015 and the internet was just as good if not better. 

[21:18] <cte900> crouch fight 

[21:18] <chairmancaleb> @Sk8rSlim Yeah? Mind sharing those links? 



[21:18] <thenewfaceofcreation> @ThatAnonyRaccoon i want the memes to stay so 

[21:18] <threedog64> Rip 

[21:18] <dukaduka> gotta crouch punch 

[21:18] <dukaduka> crouch punch into sweep 

[21:19] <seth 189> Net neutrality has been a thing since the internet started but want formally recognized by the 
FCC until 2015 

[21:19] <pinkdam> net neutrality is a psyop 

[21:19] <lightkunl988> Hey Guys HeyGuys is PubG still happening today? Gotta start work in 3 hours :( 

[21:19] <malebox85> EleGiggle 
[21:19] <sethl89> We've always had ot 

[21:19] <georgetdawson> its so confusing about net neutrality, just like politics haha 
[21:19] <thatanonyraccoon> i dont remember internet being better pre-2015 
[21:19] <malebox85> This game is a masterpiece 
[21:19] <thatanonyraccoon> maybe the same, but better? 

[21:19] <sethl89> Yeah 

[21:19] <chairmancaleb> @Sethl89 It very much is. Everything has been shouted by alarmists that are looking 
at the pessimistic side of something that could or could not happen. 

[21:19] <cazzacl> you use the internet a lot thats why it annoys you, you know you'll have to pay more lol 
[21:19] <sethl89> Chairman o can literally show you isps fucking people over seas 
[21:19] <thatanonyraccoon> @georgetdawson it literally is politics lol 
[21:19] <threedog64> Why is net neutrality suddenly important in 2017? 

[21:19] <sk8rslim> search Comcast net neutrality rules should pop up. 

[21:19] <sethl89> Can I send pics over twitch? 

[21:20] <threedog64> Like why'd he do this? 

[21:20] <chairmancaleb> @Sethl89 Does overseas have anything to do w/ the U.S? 

[21:20] <thatanonyraccoon> @Sethl89 in chat? no 

[21:20] <sethl89> Verizon blackmailed netflix into paying more so their customers don’t get throttled and make 
shows load slower 
[21:20] <sethl89> Yes 

[21:20] <dukaduka> @threedog64 because the government in the us actually starting doing something about it 

and then everyone freaked out like the idea never existed before 

[21:20] <sethl89> Because they don’t have net neutrality 

[21:20] <sethl89> That's why 

[21:20] <thexgardener> turn for up? 

[21:21] <thexgardener> fov 

[21:21] <chairmancaleb> @Sethl89 Different ISP's and countries work differently. 

[21:21] <xboxl_is_garbage> Message DarksydePhila€™s chat... 

[21:21] <sk8rslim> sadly thats the isp i have., and only option in my part of Chicago., and for them to change 
their standpoint quickly on fast lines is a big red flag.. 

[21:21] <sethl89> It's console homie 

[21:21] <chairmancaleb> Again, wait and see. QUit freaking out. 

[21:21] <nutsackilla> Blackmail? 

[21:21] <jiujitsuferret> Dooooooooooooooooood 

[21:21] <danielpagetos> Watched DSP since his dead space 1 video, good to know he is still punch shit like a god 
[21:21] <georgetdawson> is it a vote in u.s. only? 

[21:21] <thexgardener> @Sethl89 o gawd 
[21:21] <malebox85> Does Phil do drunk streams? 

[21:21] <sethl89> Ikr 

[21:21] <jv5_guy> Even the creators of the internet is against it 
[21:21] <chairmancaleb> Lol, creators of the internet? 

[21:21] <chairmancaleb> And who might they bay, Jv5? 

[21:21] <jiujitsuferret> G 



[21:22] <sethl89> It's something to be worried about, I don't wanna pay more for what I already have 
[21:22] <thatanonyraccoon> @ChairmanCaleb A1 Gore 
[21:22] <thexgardener> Reined created the internet 
[21:22] <thexgardener> Reynad 

[21:22] <leewanner> Well the good news about the removal of net neutrality is that the alarmists will be proven 
wrong now - because things are just going back to pre-2015, and it's gonna be great. 

[21:22] <sethl89> Why should I have to pay for example 4.99 a month for social media apps, and another 4.99 
for certain popular websites 

[21:22] <thatanonyraccoon> Pay the millionaires more so they can be billionaires 
[21:22] <thatanonyraccoon> "free market" 

[21:22] <jiujitsuferret> Ack ack ack 

[21:23] <chairmancaleb> @LeeWanner And it also helps smaller ISP's, but apparently there's "literally" no 
benefit whatsoever LUL 

[21:23] <sethl89> Having a dot is a li nk appearently 

[21:23] <sk8rslim> its not even the paying more part thats the worst., if this passes it effects the rest of the 
worlds connections to us based sites... 

[21:23] <malebox85> PMSTwin 
[21:23] <jv5_guy> So basically slow twitvh 
[21:23] <nutsackilla> Neutrality = y2k 

[21:23] <sethl89> Have you ever used an isp that was a victim of a slow lane before? 

[21:24] <sethl89> It sucks ass 
[21:24] <malebox85> Slow lane? 

[21:24] <sethl89> Yes 

[21:24] <threedog64> The US is dumb af 

[21:24] <sethl89> A 

[21:24] <dehumanization> reddit was pushing net neutrality hard so it must be a bad thing 

[21:24] <malebox85> Whata€™s slow lane 

[21:24] <danielpagetos> Phil PUT on some boxing gloves 

[21:24] <threedog64> Im moving to Canada 

[21:24] <georgetdawson> sit down, be humble 

[21:24] <jv5_guy> Internet isnt broken dont fix it 

[21:24] <kozatof> PLAY PUBG 

[21:25] <sethl89> A slow one is basically your connection being slowed down to a website in favor for another 

person with a different isp 

[21:25] <kozatof> not this shit 

[21:25] <sethl89> And yes play pubg 

[21:25] <kozatof> Pubg when 

[21:25] <chairmancaleb> @threedog64 Have fun paying all of your income with high taxes. Oh, and you can't 
just simply move to Canada. There are a lot of pre-requisites. 

[21:25] <kushiyakitori> so until how long is he playing? 

[21:25] <cazzacl> why should people have to pay for internet access they dont use if someone only uses Social 

Media why should they pay for overall coverage 

[21:25] <nutsackilla> Neutrality is about billionares not consumers 

[21:25] <sk8rslim> moving to Canada doesnt change your connection to US based site if the repeal passes lol 
[21:25] <georgetdawson> please dont tell me im gpnna stay up and hes not gonna play pubg 
[21:25] <kozatof> @darksydephil why you playing this garbage

[21:26] <super_skyhawk_x_> Phil is screwing furries lol 

[21:27] <leewanner> Just curious - give me a 1 if you favor so called Net Neutrality and a 2 if you oppose it. 

[21:27] <emperorscrub> Of course Phil puts a song with him in it on Kappa 

[21:27] <sethl89> These die's are garbage man been waiting and watching for like 2-3 hours :( 

[21:27] <sethl89> Oof 
[21:27] <kozatof> 69 

[21:27] <screion> without net neutrality even people like Phil are in danger of having to sign expensive business 
internet contracts for streaming 

[21:27] <concretecasket> nowhere near "I spawn I die" but still good 
[21:27] <leewanner> I like the sonic song haha 

[21:27] <malebox85> @kozatof 13 fps isna€™t enjoyable let them patch it first 
[21:27] <threedog64> $3.50

[21:28] <malebox85> @sethl89 ita€™s on test mode right now I know 
[21:28] <mose2118> @Screion Yup, Net neuter will kill Phil 
[21:28] <kozatof> @sethl89 what did he say before the break 

[21:28] <sethl89> The consoles have garbage cpus and there's only so much u can do it horribly unoptimized for 
cpus 

[21:28] <sethl89> Dude the game comes out of early access on the 20th 
[21:28] <threedog64> Putting NN aside for a sec, wtf is this song?
