[12:21] <jackwhite202> is Moira good? 

[12:21] <breath321> Is he gonna end up quitting NFS? 

[12:22] <bethemadeagle> overwatch ugh 

[12:22] <thenewfaceofcreation> @jackwhite202 well. Moria is shitty spin off of mario so.. 

[12:22] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> I can see him quitting if the races fuck him over again 
[12:23] <jackwhite202> Today is all about the Infinity War Trailer 
[12:23] <thenewfaceofcreation> Inb4 rage quits dood 

[12:23] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Infinity war trailer spoils those who haven't seen Thor yet 



[12:24] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> LUL 
[12:24] <breath321> I don't even know what Infinity War is so 
[12:24] <breath321> I guess I'm spoiler proof 
[12:24] <breath321> ah 

[12:24] <jackwhite202> Thanos vs Hulk must happen 
[12:24] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> some film for nerds 
[12:25] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Blonde black widow LUL 
[12:25] <majinboo3> People still get hyped over marvel movies lol 
[12:25] <majinboo3> that shit has been played out 

[12:25] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> well they have to something to look forward after the shit DC put out 
[12:25] <jackwhite202> everyone and their mother is hyped for Infinity War 
[12:26] <majinboo3> it cant live up to the hype 

[12:26] <majinboo3> im calling it now it will be a massive dissapointment 

[12:26] <breath321> Overwatch has aim assist on console? didn’t know that 

[12:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> compared to justice league, infinity war has every chance 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so I completely forgot to upload the unboxing of my a40 mod kit and the installation 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so im doing it right now 

[12:27] <darksydephil> then the stream will start 

[12:27] <darksydephil> its almost done 

[12:28] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> McCree has aim assist? no way DansGame 
[12:28] <majinboo3> Phil what did you think of the avengers trailer? 

[12:28] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> cool SeemsGood 
[12:30] <bethemadeagle> i loved the avengers trailer 
[12:31] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle me too brother 
[12:31] <bethemadeagle> better than whole justice league movie 
[12:32] <theycallmejimbob> kekon hype VoHiYo 

[12:33] <jackwhite202> wonder if Thanos will gather all six gems in Infinity War 

[12:33] <jackwhite202> or if they will save that for Avengers 4 

[12:33] <darksydephil> okay stream time 

[12:33] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> well it is a 2 parter 

[12:33] <jackwhite202> not anymore 

[12:33] <theycallmejimbob> cya kekon KonCha

[12:35] <bethemadeagle> hey delta

[12:35] <thatbritishlad_> :) 

[12:35] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock here we go 

[12:36] <bethemadeagle> majin you know infinity war is only part 1 right part 2 is infinity gauntlet 
[12:36] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> I'm guessing they look to reboot a few characters after infinity wars 
[12:36] <majinboo3> so, is horizon zero dawn a ps4 exlusive i literally have never even heard of this game 
[12:36] <jackwhite202> bethe is not part 1 and 2 anymore 

[12:36] <bethemadeagle> they have a bunch of movies planned in between the 2 movies though 
[12:37] <jackwhite202> marvel said they have 20 movies in development 
[12:37] <bethemadeagle> jack i still think thanos will be the main bad guy of both though 
[12:37] <jackwhite202> thats a lot 

[12:37] <majinboo3> Im gonna have to call bs on that one 
[12:37] <jackwhite202> you can search it up

[12:37] <bethemadeagle> they have a captain marvel movie happening 

[12:37] <jackwhite202> they did say that 

[12:37] <bethemadeagle> a new spidey movie 

[12:37] <bethemadeagle> black panther 

[12:37] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Gooners above Spurs LUL 

[12:37] <wxrxaxtxh> all of the movies will be shit, nothing will compare to the Nolan trilogy. 

[12:38] <bethemadeagle> prob doctor srange part 2 
[12:38] <bethemadeagle> and guardians 3 

[12:38] <majinboo3> too many sequels and not enough original content for me 
[12:38] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle they said the captain marvel is set in the 90s 
[12:38] <theycallmejimbob> Pochettino out dspAngrydsp

[12:40] <bethemadeagle> these poor unfortunate souls 

[12:40] <theycallmejimbob> Phil should be sponsored by Selsun Blue dspHinm 
[12:40] <wxrxaxtxh> so is DSP gonna do demon souls? servers close in jan 

[12:40] <bethemadeagle> jack i think all the avengers will try and fight him all at once but will prob fail at first 

and im sure he will get ALL the stones in the gauntlet 

[12:41] <aproxymate> Yesterday's YouTube rant was epic 

[12:41] <rayneepsilion3> sound good? I need that money I really do 

[12:41] <wxrxaxtxh> Alright 

[12:41] <bethemadeagle> before somehow the guardians spidey and avengers team up to kill em 
[12:41] <wxrxaxtxh> anybody use BTTV? 

[12:41] <darksydephil> well in hte mainstream marvel universe, nobody has ever been beaten while wearing the 
gauntlet 

[12:41] <darksydephil> they have to be fooled somehow to get it off of them to lose

another movie in the Dark Knight universe 

[12:42] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Will thanos cry ’death my love' when he gets defeated? LUL 
[12:42] <bethemadeagle> we cant hve tacos everyday

see Robin in action 

[12:44] <kushiyakitori> @WxRxAxTxH Its what I am using for dark mode, deleted messages, extra emotes and 
other custom options for the site. Check it out if bttv isn’t working for you currently

[13:00] <me_god> "I heard you must make a new game + in order to start the die" :P 

[13:00] <haytuff> im sure youll do great 

[13:00] <bethemadeagle> jack you dont know if they can or not i mean in the marvel universe people have been 
stopped with all the stones 

[13:00] <majinboo3> anyone with all the stones of the infinite gauntlet is effectivly unstoppable 
[13:00] <dkpgames> Im hyped for wwe sims 

[13:00] <jackwhite202> in the comics when thanos got all the stones he wiped out half the universe with a finger 
flick 

[13:00] <bethemadeagle> but they were pretty stupid 

[13:00] <majinboo3> Even if you ort me had the gauntlet we would be overpowered 
[13:00] <ornightz> A highly Smashed face Phil after 3 glasses of Shine 
[13:00] <fluttershyl970> has the Christmas goal been reached yet? 

[13:01] <ashfordian2015> Moonshine!! 

[13:01] <bethemadeagle> jack yeah that is true 
[13:01] <wxrxaxtxh> CHUNK 

[13:01] <me_god> goal reached 

[13:01] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Need for Salt 

[13:01] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle well someone who gathers all stones becomes omnipotent 
[13:01] <theycallmejimbob> You play more racing games in 2018 Phil dspHmm 



[13:01] <chrishansenlulzz> @wouldyoulikesomeballz lol 
[13:01] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle omnipotent = OP 

[13:01] <bethemadeagle> but dont forget dr strange can time travel right so if anything bad happens he can go 
bck or no 

[13:01] <me_god> phil play classic nfs underground 1, 2 and most wanted! 

[13:01] <butter_my_bread> reviewers didn’t have trouble beating NFS 

[13:01] <chrishansenlulzz> Lol he can time travel due to the time gem 
[13:02] <nicoklk2> just play the game ResidentSleeper 
[13:02] <aloofone> call of duty has lootboxes as well 
[13:02] <plizzat5> invisible wall 

[13:02] <dkpgames> Another question, FighterZ says January on Internet but in psn 6/30 

[13:02] <bethemadeagle> jack you do realize that all it tkes is one of the stones getting loose and dropping out to 

stop him having full power and that could easily happen 

[13:02] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe what were they thinking

[13:03] <khaosrayne> does no one remember having to grind and grind on FF7 ? 

[13:03] <bethemadeagle> and if the heroes get one stone the others will be easier to get after 
[13:03] <khaosrayne> that was a thing., it was needed 

[13:03] <glorytobeh> you dont HAVE to grind in FF7 unless you wanna do the superbosses 
[13:04] <chrishansenlulzz>.

[13:28] <bobbi_ling> delta go hate on someone else, i dont care enough 
[13:28] <thackmypushy> You need to upgrade to Playstation 4 pro! 

[13:28] <dkpgames> That was a long load screen 

[13:28] <glorytobeh> I’d say comfort and long life. Thats what I’d look for 
[13:28] <scoopula> R1 
[13:28] <me_god> no ammo 

[13:28] <wxrxaxtxh> @TheNewFaceofCreation he/it wants to be a mod so bad lmfao 
[13:28] <paddingtonbearl87> @thackmypushy does the pro inprove framerate?

[13:28] <stuart360> Is everyone elses Twitch all messed up colour wise? 

[13:29] <bobbMing> these socks 

[13:29] <scoopula> Hold x while highlighting a weapon to craft ammo 

[13:29] <zahvone> @Glorytobeh Comfort and long life. I’d suggest sennheisers or bose. Cheaper I would go for 
HyperX, Turtlebeach, or Astro 

[13:29] <bethemadeagle> i heard they have a bear machine in this die :0 

[13:29] <zahvone> @Glorytobeh Generic answer unfortunately, but that's all I can suggest. 

[13:29] <vendatus> it's basically AC Kappa 
[13:29] <thenewfaceofcreation> "Socks" 

[13:29] <theycallmejimbob> dspFun 

[13:29] <zahvone> Or audiotechnica 

[13:29] <sardarkh> It's easy phil, you point & shoot 

[13:29] <wxrxaxtxh> FUF 

[13:29] <paddingtonbearl87> WHYYY? mskkS 

[13:29] <kushiyakitori> level 35? wonder if that might be too low for the die 
[13:29] <bethemadeagle> jim 10 deaths deal?!?! 

[13:29] <thackmypushy> Not in Zero Dawn. But definitely with Monster Hunter World! 

[13:29] <glorytobeh> @Zahvone no, not generic at all thank you I will look into those brands 
[13:29] <allntzz> 8 whoppin months? naiss 
[13:29] <paddingtonbearl87> oh 

[13:30] <marshmelons> its about 40 hours long, a very thick meaty veiny game 

[13:30] <butter_my_bread> they just nerfed the end all be all armor of this game. I borrowed it and played on 



very hard after the recommendation from a YTuber/streamer who worked on the official guide. Im excited for 
the complete Edition with the die on disc to arrive in the next week so I can finish it 
[13:30] <bethemadeagle> dspFacepahn 

[13:30] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Spurs are in 7th place LUL LUL LUL

[13:30] <bethemadeagle> i give up 
[13:30] <princegl03> So I preordered pubg today 

[13:30] <zahvone> @Glorytobeh My favorite brand overall is Audiotechnica. Relatively cheap as well, great 

audio signature, loud with no distortion, easy to drive, etc etc 

[13:30] <bobbi_ling> on what beth 

[13:30] <kushiyakitori> nope 

[13:30] <kushiyakitori> lol 

[13:30] <marshmelons> even at level 35 its gonna be tough, this die feels like bloodborne at times 

[13:30] <zahvone> @Princegl03 Enjoy it 

[13:30] <bethemadeagle> on trying to talk to jim he not listening 

[13:30] <stuart360> Ah Dark mode was on for some reason

[13:31] <princegl03> Thanks @zahvone 

[13:31] <zahvone> @Princegl03 Inb4 first game is a win. 

[13:31] <kushiyakitori> Unless the missions scale, he is going to have a hard time since the quest levels are 

higher than the normal game ones 

[13:31] <scoopula> How do you turn off dark mode?

[13:31] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock Bobbi 

[13:31] <thackmypushy> But more games in the future will definitely improve with the Pro. Even for 1080p 
screens there will be better textures, drawdistans and framerate! 

[13:31] <scoopula> @stuart360 Thanks 

[13:32] <kushiyakitori> he doesn't have infinite fast travel? hmm 

[13:32] <ornightz> cheerlO You love to Pop off a Couple swear words whenever a Specific Game riles you up , 
What's your Most Iconic Swear ? 

[13:32] <ellietsantiara> @darksydephil Remember you can craft arrows on the go 

[13:32] <zahvone> @ThackMyPushy I think if resolution is being pushed, 1440p is more logical than 4k 

currently on console. Even on PC actually. 

[13:32] <wxrxaxtxh> Ozil > Eriksen 

[13:32] <zahvone> @ThackMyPushy I agree, however.

[13:37] <zahvone> Oh yeah, Onimusha was sick 

[13:37] <ellietsantiara> @darksydephil Remember that if you see yellow colored ledges, it means you can climb 
them 



[13:37] <bobbi_ling> this game is downgraded beth. too simplified 
[13:37] <dkpgames> Who made these robot birbs 
[13:38] <katexo234> oh shoes Phil 

[13:38] <bobbi_ling> paul heyman made the robot birds according to the lore 

[13:38] <bethemadeagle> bobbi i tried morrowind and said fuck it im going back to oblivion :D 

[13:39] <dkpgames> Nice a great manager snd scientist 

[13:39] <zahvone> Alright gonna play Elite: Dangerous while I watch. 

[13:39] <bobbi_ling> you are too dumb to play morrowind beth 
[13:39] <stuart360> This kind of looks like Skyrim on PC graphics wise 
[13:39] <korewasugoi> @stuart360 nothing close 

[13:39] <me_god> ... tentacles! I'M IN 

[13:39] <bethemadeagle> a least i tried give me credit damn it 

[13:39] <zahvone> @stuart360 I see what you mean. Better textures in this game, though. 

[13:39] <stuart360> Nah its close,c not quite Skyrim standards but its close 
[13:39] <marshmelons> pc users are blind lrnao 
[13:39] <eldeadmariachi> He means Heavily modded 

[13:39] <bobbi_ling> when did you try morrowind? you only play on playstations 
[13:39] <korewasugoi> @stuart360 this looks like garbage compared to Skyrim modded 
[13:39] <korewasugoi> ofc 

[13:39] <marshmelons> the damage control is too funny 

[13:40] <korewasugoi> why play vanilla when there are mods 

[13:40] <scoopula> Skyrim looks like garbage compared to this are you kidding. 

[13:40] <stiliqn007> CoolStoryBob cool noises bro 
[13:40] <bobbi_ling> another lie beth 
[13:40] <dkpgames> Cuz my pc is bad? 

[13:40] <bethemadeagle> i tried it a couple weeks ago on my shit pc which cant run games on it :D 

[13:40] <stuart360> I have to agree, my modded Skyrim looks better than anything though. It kind of put 

proffesional devs to shame really 

[13:40] <bobbi_ling> liar 

[13:40] <bethemadeagle> so i said fuck that 

[13:40] <zahvone> I can't wait to experience the next iteration of the bethesda game engine 
[13:40] <zahvone> Seriously 

[13:40] <bethemadeagle> it was a laggy piece of crap 
[13:40] <ellietsantiara> Look for yellow ledges 
[13:40] <bethemadeagle> so i deleted it 

[13:40] <marshmelons> its crazy how this ps4 exclusive makes so many pc fanboys so insecure 
[13:40] <calo_nord_> fuck bethesda 

[13:40] <zahvone> the only issues I have with it, are that the engine becomes dated so quickly. :( 

[13:40] <vendatus> these graphics are worse than Skyrim on switch LUL 

[13:40] <bethemadeagle> my pc couldnt handle it 

[13:41] <zahvone> What's wrong with bethesda? lol 

[13:41] <dkpgames> Thats because theres 6 years of mods for skyrim 

[13:41] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @zahvone day one bugs, broken mechanic? 

[13:41] <eldeadmariachi> @stuart360 Yeah, some ENB makes Skyrim look so perfect 
[13:41] <vendatus> Keepo 

[13:41] <stuart360> Eh?, this would be a very average looking PC game to be honest 

[13:41] <zahvone> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz I'll take bugs and broken mechanics over lootboxes and 

microtransacs 

[13:41] <bobbi_ling> enb = epic name bro 
[13:41] <zahvone> ENB is interesting. 

[13:41] <ass_blastor> the snow graphics in this are amazing 
[13:41] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> same 



[13:41] <stiliqn007> these graphics remind me of Mario 64 SlyJeremy 
[13:41] <ass_blastor> Skyrim is 8 bit compared to it 
[13:41] <korewasugoi> Looks outdated already 
[13:41] <korewasugoi> damn 

[13:42] <eldeadmariachi> @zahvone Nothing don’t listen to them 
[13:42] <divanerasmus> DLC and loot box hype 
[13:42] <katexo234> the lighting dspSurpriseddsp 

[13:42] <stuart360> Rise of the Tomb Raider on PC maxed looks a couple of levels above this to be honest, plus 
60fps to boot 

[13:42] <zahvone> Lol, we can all agree that while bethesda games are often quite buggy and broken 
[13:42] <zahvone> They are indeed FANTASTIC games, usually. 

[13:42] <marshmelons> tomb raider looks like a 360 game even on pc 
[13:42] <bethemadeagle> kate you going to play this? 

[13:42] <vendatus> ohai Ashley Burch aka Chloe aka Tiny Tina Kreygasm 
[13:42] <eldeadmariachi> @zahvone Poooound 
[13:42] <me_god> @marshmelons woah there. 

[13:43] <stuart360> Sony fanboys really do live in a bubble dont they, they are getting as bad as Nintendo fans 
[13:43] <katexo234> of course bethe I played the game why not play the die 

[13:43] <zahvone> I only wish they would broaden their HORIZON and push beyond simply just fantasy and 
post-epidemic sci-fi lol 

[13:43] <marshmelons> damn these pc fanboys get butthurt so easy 
[13:43] <bethemadeagle> stuart huh i dont live in a bubble 
[13:43] <zahvone> @stuart360 What's a ninteendo 
[13:43] <deepdrive3254> so this is skyrim now? :D 
[13:43] <korewasugoi> Botw mechanics 
[13:44] <korewasugoi> kek 

[13:44] <vendatus> bethe confirmed Bubble Boy LUL 
[13:44] <bobbi_ling> dragons ruined skyrim 

[13:44] <bethemadeagle> deep well if you think cold snowy mountains as skyrim sure 

[13:44] <eldeadmariachi> @stuart360 I never understand the "I love this console but I hate the others" I consider 
myself a PlayStation fan and yet I enjoy Xbox and Nintendo 

[13:44] <me_god> @marshmelons i’m talking about the game, rottr has insane graphcis 

[13:44] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi Agreed. I'm a fan of video games. 

[13:44] <iconicmasterl> Yu gi oh encore marathon stream HSVoid 

[13:44] <stuart360> Nah you’re cool bethe, i just mean the ones that think every exclusive is some how 'the best 
looking game ever made', when in reality they look quite average to PC games 
[13:44] <marshmelons> rottr looks awful though, even ffl 3 looks better 
[13:44] <bobbi_ling> skyrims tombstone says "dragons ruined me" 

[13:44] <hobbsl017> @deepdrive3254 skyrim is lOOOOOx better with more depth 
[13:44] <deepdrive3254> horizon zero dawn was great 

[13:44] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi The problem is that once you get a PC and game on it a little bit, you start 
to understand how limited consoles are - not by power but by possiblities 

[13:44] <scoopula> There is no PC game that looks better than this. Higher resolution doesn’t make a game look 
better. 

[13:45] <vendatus> ehh it was alright 

[13:45] <me_god> @marshmelons not true, too much snow, but where there's no snow, it's brilliant 

[13:45] <bethemadeagle> bobbi calm down 

[13:45] <stuart360> lol Scoopula thanks for proving my point 

[13:45] <korewasugoi> Console games look like med-high settings on pc 

[13:45] <marshmelons> its kinda sad when a pc fanboy gets so insecure over a game that undermines thousands 
of dollars of investment 

[13:45] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi I can stream, listen to music, watch videos, read books, chat, etc etc and 



game at the same time on PC. But on console it feels...normal. 

[13:45] <lvlpower> did Phil have to pay for this die 

[13:45] <eldeadmariachi> @zahvone Yeah I get that. I have a gaming pc too but not that powerful to fully run 
these games 

[13:45] <zahvone> It’s to the point in which I barely enjoy video games anymore lol 

[13:46] <scoopula> @stuart360 I would be mad too if I bought $2000 worth of PC parts and sub worse 

performance than a $300 console 

[13:46] <stiliqn007> bugged eye mechanics 

[13:46] <vendatus> HZD is basically future FC Kappa 

[13:46] <zahvone> Nothing is satiating my focus 

[13:46] <fr2styi> Buggy eyes 

[13:46] <marshmelons> even pc fanboys dont wanna play pc games 
[13:46] <wxrxaxtxh> bugged? 

[13:46] <lvlpower> I'm gonna final out 

[13:46] <zahvone> LOL @marshmelons Yes! How true, sadly. 

[13:46] <kushiyakitori> R3 
[13:46] <shlnn> R3 ? 

[13:46] <bobbi_ling> its usally piss4 vs xbae one dspHmm 

[13:46] <me_god> @marshmelons well, most of them are controle-to-pc ports 

[13:46] <aloofone> look at the controls in the menu? 

[13:46] <imaidenr> frost 

[13:47] <stuart360> Actually my PC was A£500, and its more powerful than the X. Keep up the lOyo PC memes 
though 

[13:47] <marshmelons> could you imagine investing thousands of dollars on pc hardware only to spend more 
tijme watching ps4 games lol 

[13:47] <eldeadmariachi> @marshmelons I don’t play in my pc that much because I find my consoles con 
comfortable, my PC is really noise comparex to my ps4 
[13:47] <korewasugoi> used pc parts yo 

[13:47] <zahvone> I love the PC platform - for how modular it is and everything I can do with it. But my friends 

have ps4 and that's completely fine. It's easier for them financially 

[13:47] <korewasugoi> people dont know that Pc can be built from used stuff 

[13:47] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi Believe it or not my PC is somewhat beefy and damn near silent. In fact 

you can’t even hear my PC at all, partially due to the case having foam inside but, still lol 

[13:47] <dooley258> The Xbox one x is not nearly as powerful as MS wants you to believe 

[13:47] <bobbMing> your friends are casul 

[13:47] <korewasugoi> not some off the shelf shit 

[13:47] <zahvone> and I have 8 fans. 

[13:48] <lvlpower> Yes Phil spend money on this die 

[13:48] <scoopula> I wouldn't use used PC parts unless you like your PC to be covered in Cheeto dust 
[13:48] <kushiyakitori> ... what difficulty is this? 

[13:48] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Consoles aren’t blessed with Gaben steam sales though 
[13:48] <stuart360> Once you get used to mods (and higher rewsolutions and framerates obviously) its hard to 
go back to consoles, and i was a console gamer for 20+ years 
[13:48] <zahvone> Are you ready for a miracle ? 

[13:48] <eldeadmariachi> @zahvone Cool, I'll upgrade my pc oncel have more money. My PC Have 5 

coolmaster fans thats why is noisy

[13:49] <vendatus> Jimbob you're screwed LUL 
[13:49] <me_god> use ropes! 

[13:49] <pedropatriciol991> *i dont remember how to play the game* blames the game 
[13:49] <lvlpower> full price $19 unless his got ps plus it's $14 

[13:49] <butter_my_bread> PC is a money pit. you're always just chasing benchmarks 

[13:49] <katexo234> jimbob whyyyy 

[13:49] <zahvone> @stuart360 My biggest comparison for the whole console - PC argument isn't graphics at all. 
It's always framerate, and the amount of content you can consume at once. 

[13:49] <kushiyakitori> LOOK IN THE MENU 
[13:49] <pray4rock> Use the trip wires traps 

[13:49] <marshmelons> even "pc gamers" spend all their time watching console games cos theres nothing on 
there 

[13:49] <bethemadeagle> jim I FUCKED YOU SO HARD 
[13:49] <bobbi_ling> play NITW instead 

[13:49] <kushiyakitori> lrnao the game explains your equipment well 

[13:49] <bethemadeagle> i am not ashamed 

[13:49] <kushiyakitori> you have more than 4 weapons 

[13:49] <kushiyakitori> look at the damn menus lol 

[13:50] <channel33> why the fuck are you playing this shit? 

[13:50] <me_god> @Zahvone the main pc argument is freedom of choice. 

[13:50] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi I believe mine does as well. I have a Ryzen cpu so it should be quite noisy 
considering I'm using the default cooler... this case is incredible. VERY silent. 

[13:50] <dominonova> As long as you are having fun on the platform you are playing on why does it matter? 
[13:50] <aloofone> this could be a fast playthrough 

[13:50] <zahvone> @me_god That's a better choice of words actually. Thank you 

[13:50] <me_god> :) 

[13:50] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Man city drawing LUL 

[13:50] <stuart360> PC is not a money pit at all, its just another console fanboy myth. My PC was A£500 (with a 
980ti), and my old PC had a Q9650 cpu and thats over 9 years old now, it still ran games fine 
[13:50] <zahvone> @DominoNova It shouldn't. Everyone should enjoy it - the biggest issue is cross-platform. :(I 
[13:50] <dooley258> I dona€™t like the pc community, too many hackers and pirates 
[13:50] <korewasugoi> Pirates make it bad? 

[13:50] <katexo234> bethe don't get too cocky 

[13:50] <bethemadeagle> my weapons dealt with every situation gimme my trip wires, my tear and flame arrows 
and my hardpoint arrows 

[13:50] <zahvone> @dooley258 That is a fair point. 

[13:50] <korewasugoi> free games

[13:50] <stuart360> That is true Dooley unfortunately 
[13:50] <darthradovanviking> lol yeah that damn pc comunity 
[13:50] <bethemadeagle> fuck em all up 



[13:51] <bethemadeagle> kate maybe i am getting too cocky 

[13:51] <dooley258> But therea€™s no question that pc is the best option for gaming 

[13:51] <zahvone> People still hack and cheat on console though lol. Like using a keyboard and mouse on 

console for FPS games is just bullshit but 

[13:51] <zahvone> Ehhh 

[13:51] <me_god> the 1st mistake console only gamers do , is assuming you buy a pc with "I want the best 

graphics!! 11!" objective 
[13:51] <kingcruz713> cheerlO 
[13:51] <deepdrive3254> take it out 

[13:52] <darthradovanviking> I hope you are joking dooley it think it would be a bit unfair to call everyone 
using pc a community :D 

[13:52] <dooley258> I use mouse and keyboard for shooters on consoles yeah 

[13:52] <bethemadeagle> pc is the best option for gaming but you cant shit on switch, xbone or ps4 just because 
you got a super duper upgraded high tech pc that is not fair at all 
[13:52] <vendatus> Fortnite cheaters LUL 

[13:52] <kingcruz713> been following you since the fallout 3 days 

[13:52] <stuart360> But you opnly need an 13 and a 750ti to beat XB1 and PS4, and thats like a LOOOOOOW 
end PC 

[13:52] <me_god> communities do not exist. 

[13:52] <eldeadmariachi> @me_god Yeah. I actually bought a pc because on the long run you save lots of 

money with the steam sales 

[13:52] <popsicolo> "Aloy, I'll knock your teeth in. Get me some sausages! RBRBRBRBBR!" -Rost

[13:52] <bausleyfred> @KingCruz713 thats a long time, i been following since street fighter hd remix 
[13:52] <scoopula> I have an i7 and a 1080 and console is still better looking 
[13:52] <bobbi_ling> you have a job beth 
[13:52] <kozatof> DOOLEY 

[13:52] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil you arn’t a big fan of the horizon hype train why play the DLC ? is it 
now beter somehow ? 

[13:52] <kozatof> DOOLEY BOMB 

[13:53] <marshmelons> if pc had actual games that werent just early access indie shit like pubg then maybe it 
could be taken seriously 

[13:53] <deepdrive3254> well bethe has a kid now bobbi 

[13:53] <bethemadeagle> bobbi so doesnt mean i can affor a xbone or switch or a good pc 
[13:53] <popsicolo> BeThe, I'll knock your teeth in. Get me some sausages! RBRBRBRBBR! 

[13:53] <aloofone> youre gonna need to learn how to fight anyways, not smart to skip enemies you may have to 
face in the future 

[13:53] <eldeadmariachi> @bethemadeagle That's how fanboys thinks. I personally dont hate any game or 
console. 

[13:53] <stuart360> There are a 100 times m ore PC games than console games, thats just flat out wrong 
marshmellow 

[13:53] * bethemadeagle gives pops all the sausages he wants 
[13:53] <popsicolo> :sausage: 

[13:53] <sardarkh> Just 40x explosive tripwire and you are good to go 
[13:53] <bethemadeagle> i dont hate oc either 

[13:54] <bethemadeagle> games maybe who knows bobbi makes me hate em more than most 

[13:54] <me_god> you can't play the best version of f.e.a.r. and crysis on console ;) 

[13:54] <vendatus> Pops really likes his meats TriHard 

[13:54] <marshmelons> inide shovelware on steam greenlit made by some random Chinese dude jacking off 



doesnt count 

[13:54] <breath321> Are we actually having a PC vs console discussion right now? It's pretty widely accepted 
that PC is better, but console is more convenient and intuitive 
[13:54] <popsicolo> This reminds me of New York last winter. 

[13:54] <kittyspank> ahh 

[13:54] <bethemadeagle> pops oh cool now im even more cold 

[13:54] <butter_my_bread> @stuart360 i would feel inadequate if i didn’t make a splash with a 17 6700 1080ti 

and that would be a lot of money for barely 4K 60 fps even tho id probably opt for 1440p 120fps especially for 
Multiplayer games but then I'd have to buy the monitor to boot, i just dont know when the right time is to jump in 
and I don't care about pc exclusives, ya know? 

[13:54] <popsicolo> Sweating in the snow WutFace 

[13:54] <sardarkh> Oh yeah. This is a game.Not fucking lootboxes 

[13:54] <eldeadmariachi> Wow wall text 

[13:54] <popsicolo> That sweat's gonna freeze WutFace 

[13:55] <ellietsantiara> Ugh, chat is taking about stupid off topic bullshit as always, nice 
[13:55] <bethemadeagle> pops you can sweat in cold places dont look likt that 
[13:55] <vendatus> too much snow last year Pops dspPepe 

[13:55] <butter_my_bread> I have an addictive personality lmao 

[13:55] <popsicolo> Outlander? Is this Morrowind? KappaHD 
[13:55] <popsicolo> RED MOUNTAIN 
[13:55] <eldeadmariachi> Vol-Kano 
[13:55] <wxrxaxtxh> KappaPride 

[13:55] <darthradovanviking> you're review tech USA are you not? @Butter_My_Bread 

[13:55] <zahvone> I don't think 4k is even a good goal for people to hit right now unless you're a content creator 

or content consumer of the heaviest degree 

[13:55] <dooley258> This looks impressive for a ps4 game 

[13:55] <scoopula> 4K is still a gimmick 

[13:55] <popsicolo> I know you can sweat in the BeThe. I'm saying that that sweat is going to freeze. 

[13:55] <breath321> Yeah when console can barely make it to a stable 60fps, 4k is a pretty ridiculous think to go 
for 

[13:55] <thebigtjl337> lmao 

[13:55] <thenewfaceofcreation> @EllietSantiAra oh shut up 

[13:55] <ass_blastor> @Butter_My_Bread Have you ever opened your door to take a step outside your house? 

[13:55] <zahvone> I think 1440p should be more than enough right now for most people to aim for. At least if 

you're aiming for graphics, aim for framerate lol 

[13:55] <vendatus> It's Mordor we must save Talion LUL 

[13:56] <zahvone> Talion! 

[13:56] <stuart360> Butter my bread, my PC has a I56600K, 16gb DDR4 Ram, and a 980ti, which can max out 
any game atl440p and even 4k. You dont need to spend as much as you thi nk to have a PC capable of blowing 
away modern games 
[13:56] <breath321> thing, even 

[13:56] <dooley258> I have a 4K oled tv and I can assure you that games look amazing in 4K 
[13:56] <dooley258> Even when ita€™s not true 4K 
[13:56] <popsicolo> Is this Solstheim? popsicSmug 

[13:56] <zahvone> I know games look great in 4k - it's just not economical for most people right now 

[13:56] <butter_my_bread> @ass_blastor why don’t u ask phil that if we’re throwing stones and yes of course i 

have smartypants :P 

[13:56] <breath321> @dooley258 Yeah I'm sure they look amazing, but it would be much much better to have 
better performance in consoles, rather than more better graphics and an even lower fps 

[13:56] <zahvone> and when console gamers try to make the move into PC, they just see 4k and then they see 
the "price to performance" ration and back out 

[13:57] <dooley258> You can get decent 4K tva€™s for a few hundred dollars 



[13:57] <popsicolo> The really got the frosty winter night aesthetic down really well. 

[13:57] <eldeadmariachi> I never understand why people lose their shit over 4k. 1080p is more than fine for me 
[13:57] <me_god> try 4k :D 

[13:57] <korewasugoi> whoever said "4k is a gimmick" is an idiot 

[13:57] <stuart360> Like i said, its not even the better graphics that make the PC so great, its the mods. Mods 

just transform games 

[13:57] <pray4rock> 4K and HDR 

[13:57] <darthradovanviking> it is fine when you are used to 1080p but if you have gotten used to 4k you wil tell 
the difference 

[13:57] <zahvone> No one said 4k was a gimmick 

[13:57] <ellietsantiara> the game de selected the quest marker 

[13:57] <zahvone> I'm saying that for the average consumer and gamer, 4k is ECONOMICAL. 

[13:57] <aloofone> i only play at 1080p 60fps so my 4790 with a 1060 is fine for me 
[13:57] <dooley258> I agree, mods are amazing 

[13:57] <bethemadeagle> pops you doubted son interactive entertainment how dare you, im joking before people 
say im a fanboy 

[13:57] <zahvone> Especially if it's your first or second build 
[13:57] <ass_blastor> what resolution is 4K? 

[13:58] <breath321> 4k itself is not a gimmick, PC has had 4k gaming for a long time, the gimmick is consoles 
focusing on 4k when they should be getting their hardware up to far, whenever a cheap PC already outperforms 
them 

[13:58] <bethemadeagle> people too sensitive 

[13:58] <vendatus> I wonder if Aloy has frosty nips right now dspPepe 
[13:58] <scoopula> 4K is like 3D TV 
[13:58] <scoopula> It will be gone in a year 
[13:58] <bethemadeagle> ven of course 

[13:58] <grsicki> people like 4k because there is a noticable difference and looks very sexy 
[13:58] <scoopula> 12K is where it's at 

[13:58] <butter_my_bread> @stuart360 u can emulate Zelda BotW at 4K 60fps now 

[13:58] <zahvone> Lootchests! 

[13:58] <bobbi ling> mods let me be a child killer SeemsGood 
[13:58] <popsicolo> I need to be able to see all of Aloy's pores. 

[13:58] <azotherian> @DarksydePhil why not use Cyber Monday to get better parts slowly for a better PC? 
[13:58] <divanerasmus> loot box hype sumFail 

[13:58] <stuart360> Yeah the Pro and the X should just do 1440p (for new games). The X could then have 
higher settings and possibly better framerates 

[13:58] <zahvone> @Azotherian Don't have the money for it right now 

[13:58] <deepdrive3254> now theres gonna be people demanding phil upload in 4k at 60fps 

[13:58] <butter_my_bread> puts buying a switch into perspective if you're weary of Mario titles, i do love my 

mario kart and Smash tho 

[13:59] <vendatus> Aloy the poor mans Ygritte LUL 

[13:59] <popsicolo> "My name's not Nora. It's Aloy!" -Aloy, of the Nora 

[13:59] <stuart360> Already did it Butter My Bread, it barely even used any resources as well which is pretty 
funny when you see how hard it pushes the Switch 

[13:59] <ass_blastor> 4k isn't really 4k, its 2k, 2160p. Saying 4K is same as saying 1080p is 2k 
[13:59] <bethemadeagle> ven who was ygritte again i remember that name 
[13:59] <popsicolo> They're doing a Maori Haka PogChamp 
[13:59] <nnif> Live shot from America in 2050 

[13:59] <azotherian> I bought a GTX 1050 Ti for $130, that's not too bad 
[13:59] <popsicolo> WRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY

[14:00] <stuart360> Ass Blaster its the 3840 part that they use to say '4k', you’re right though 
[14:00] <lvlpower> that sounds like they were trying to make some music 
[14:00] <darthradovanviking> ok that sound is too scary for me 
[14:00] <vendatus> You know nothing Bethe

[14:00] <popsicolo> Foreign cultures are scary NotLikeThis 

[14:00] <zahvone> @Azotherian It’s true that it's not a ton of money - but I don’t think he's even thinking about 

being a pc streamer or gamer at all so lol

[14:00] <grsicki> @Azotherian that's cool i ordered my 1080 waiting for it patiently kills :( 

[14:00] <vendatus> burd 

[14:00] <azotherian> @Zahvone just offering a suggestion 
[14:00] <bethemadeagle> pops nah this game is better 

[14:00] <breath321> @Azotherian PC doesn't know how to use a PC for gaming, he's had issues before, didn’t 

try to fix them and just shit talked PC as a platform and stopped trying 

[14:00] <korewasugoi> ruining the moment phil 

[14:01] <breath321> @Azotherian DSP doesn't know how to, even 

[14:01] <zahvone> @Azotherian Oh, no I understand lol. Just joining the conversation is all. I'm actually due for 
a gpu upgrade. 

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> ARATAK MY MAN 

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> we will get to know this guy well 

[14:01] <vendatus> it's Hiccups dad LUL 

[14:01] <ass_blastor> 4K is just a marketing term for people who aren’t familiar with what resolutions are 
[14:01] <azotherian> @Breath321 it makes sense. Before I built my own PC, I had an out-of-the-box wahnart pc 
[14:01] <divanerasmus> you witnessed corpse hijacking 
[14:01] <azotherian> so I know the feels 

[14:01] <stuart360> Actually i’d prefer Phil to just stick to consoles for playthroughs. PC's can still be a bit tricky 
problem wise. I do wish he had the money to get the Pro and X though 
[14:01] <azotherian> @Zahvone I am upgrading from a 560 Ti I bought 6 years ago 
[14:02] <i_spawn_i_die> Why is Seamen white?

[14:02] <zahvone> @Azotherian I bet that 560 is better than my RX 480 

[14:02] <breath321> @stuart360 Yeah he won't be able to fix any issues with PC if he has them, and will just 
complain endlessly, it's best if he sticks to console 
[14:02] <bobbMing> lewd art pops 

[14:02] <grsicki> KappaPride give me that popsicle @Popsicolo 

[14:02] <popsicolo> This isn't the first lewd art I've done today either, Bobbi. 

[14:02] <stuart360> Ass Blaster yeah but its more because if 1080p was lk and 2160p was 2k, people would 
thi nk that 2k is just twice as good, where in reality its 4 times the resoltion over 1080p 
[14:03] <azotherian> oh no @Zahvone. according to GPUBoss, yours is better than mine 
[14:03] <bethemadeagle> jjimbob liverppol, man city, everton, chelsea and arsenal all won today and rooney

not great performance.

[14:04] <popsicolo> Burgrend looks like a younger version of my grandfather. 

[14:05] <azotherian> @Zahvone I'm sorry to hear that, is it just because of a manufacturing issue, or is it a 
known issue with that brand/model?

[14:06] <azotherian> @Zahvone my video card that I am getting is a PNY - XLR8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 
Ti 4GB GDDR5 

[14:06] <bobbi_ling> twitch says im invisible 

[14:06] <breath321> @bass619 he only interacts in pre-stream 

[14:07] <me_god> during a cutscene? ok 

[14:07] <me_god> i can see you bobbi 

[14:07] <zahvone> 1050 huh? That's a nice healthy upgrade from the 560. Hope you enjoy it! :) 

[14:07] <darkone667> @bass619 come on man he works his ass off 24/7 he has no energy left to interract with 
chat 

[14:07] <ellietsantiara> How is he gonna interact if everyone's talking stupid shit that has nothing to do with the 
game? lol 

[14:07] <bethemadeagle> oh well you are invisible on my screen but i can still see you here

[14:08] <breath321> @EllietSantiAra Maybe comment his thoughts on what people are discussing, it's hard to 
talk about the stream whenever the game is not really popular and Phil isn’t giving much commentary 



[14:08] <azotherian> @Zahvone thanks. I can give you my 560 Ti if you want a replacement gpu

[14:09] <ellietsantiara> No, if Phil sees the chat is talking about random off topi shit, he's just gonna focus on the 
game 

[14:09] <zahvone> @Azotherian I appreciate it, but you might be better off keeping it as a backup gpu. You 
never know! 

[14:09] <zahvone> @ratchefanl2 Welcome welcome 

[14:09] <bethemadeagle> the shamans path is the main quest though 

[14:09] <breath321> I'm upgrading my CPU, GPU, mouse and mousepad for Christmas, getting an i7, and a 1080 

ti, still deciding on mouse and mousepad though

[14:09] <zahvone> @Breath321 When you get that intel cpu, make sure you update your bios 100% to the 
newest update. There was a huge security issue with intel cpus 
[14:09] <bethemadeagle> hey ratchefan 

[14:10] <me_god> I’m 23 but I died twice, good thing I quicksaved 

[14:10] <popsicolo> Something needs to happen first.

[14:10] <d_801> what are you doing then?? 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> well phil not much is happening right now in the game so nothing to talk about 
[14:10] <zahvone> @DarksydePhil What do you think is the next big thing for game engines? Lighting? Texture 
rendering? Sound? 

[14:10] <i_spawn_i_die> @DarksydePhil you received a tip 

[14:10] cbutter_my_bread> @breath321 i guess u did ur due diligence and ur motherboard is compatible? 

Changing a motherboard is something ive heard ppl are kinda leery about doing 

[14:10] <me_god> just the tip? 

[14:10] <hands_celebratory> im 64 

[14:10] <ratchefanl2> wow this new twitch layout sucks

[14:11] <amypinkgirl21> Hello friends

forget he's doing this for Youtube audience as well 
[14:11] <zahvone> Hello @amypinkgirl21 

[14:11] <breath321> @Zahvone Yeah I've had a Radeon RX 460, a lot of people warned me about that. 

@Butter_My_Bread Yep, won't be having to change my motherboard to get the i7 

[14:11] <hands_celebratory> anyone wanna meet? 

[14:11] <me_god> have you heard you can be permabanned, from fortnite, for "streaming hostile, hateful 

behaviour"? 

[14:11] <amypinkgirl21> How everyone doing today 

[14:11] <breath321> @Zahvone As in switching from AMD to Intel GPU 

[14:11] <darkone667> his audience is 300-350 ppl that are here on stream 

[14:11] <marshmelons> i love when a console game is so good even hardcore pc fanboys get so upset over it 



[14:11] <darkone667> same ppl are his yt audience 
[14:11] <korewasugoi> less than that 

[14:11] <zahvone> @Breath321 Alright just making sure! :). I currently have a Ryzen 1700 and it's fantastic so 
far. Hope you enjoy your new setup. :D 

[14:12] <breath321> @marshmelons I don’t see anyone upset in the chat really, and I’ve never heard of the game

[14:20] <azotherian> what alcohol is phil drinking for his "7+ hour marathon"? 

[14:20] <wxrxaxtxh> @Azotherian gin 

[14:20] <azotherian> @WxRxAxTxH he drinks that like it was water. Needs something stronger 
[14:21] <me_god> ropes!

[14:21] <concretecasket> Tetris in 4k 

[14:21] <wxrxaxtxh> @Azotherian i agree he needs to add some lean 
[14:21] <bobbi_ling> does wraths twitch pic look like a cheeto? 

[14:21] <paddingtonbearl87> UHHHHHHH mskkBird 

[14:21] <bethemadeagle> oh yeah all the machines a demonic in this game which is the same as corrupted 
[14:21] <breath321> It's pretty good yeah 

[14:21] <bethemadeagle> i cant wait until he finds newer TOUGHER machines 

[14:21] <stuart360> To be fair, the falling snow looks good, not so much the deformation on the ground though. 
ROTTR looks better for that 
[14:21] <bobbi_ling> kane? 

[14:22] <marshmelons> daemonic in this game makes them insanely aggressive like a frenzied monster in mh4u 
[14:22] <direwolfsif> L3 slows time 

[14:22] <popsicolo> I heard the game devs watched nature documentaries as inspiration for the game's art style. 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> bobbi maybe but i mean kane isnt tough he got destroyed by braun 
[14:22] <me_god> yeah, you could draw penises in ROTTR 



[14:22] <azotherian> Have you guys seen the Witcher 3 water effects 
[14:22] <paddingtonbearl87> STOOPID shhnow 
[14:22] <azotherian> ? 

[14:22] <marshmelons> rottr looks worse though and its way more boring 
[14:22] <bobbi_ling> but hes da big red machine 
[14:22] <paddingtonbearl87> mechaniqs 
[14:22] <azotherian> so sweet and pretty cool 

[14:22] <popsicolo> Imagine how bad this would look if you were still using your camcorder, Phil. 

[14:22] <bethemadeagle> pops why not i mean they got nothing better to do 
[14:22] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil hiya phil hope the days been good

[14:23] <paddingtonbearl87> mskkF 
[14:23] <doctorzzz> to see the indicator 

[14:23] <marshmelons> too many people get distracted by lara's ass to notice the ps2 graphics 
[14:23] <paddingtonbearl87> scanning 
[14:23] <bobbi ling> kane x undertaker yaoi 

[14:23] <stuart360> Marshmelolow unless you have played the PC version, you can't talk. It looks a couple of 

levels above this. Stop being so close minded 

[14:23] <vendatus> I want the South Park DLC now LUL 

[14:23] <breath321> @stuart360 It's bait, just ignore it 

[14:23] <azotherian> @stuart360 he be a console pleb. Let us ignore his trolling ways 
[14:23] <doctorzzz> kill that dude 

[14:23] <me_god> at least he just acknowledged lara's ass 

[14:23] <popsicolo> This is what it's going to look like when I go up into the hills to look for Krampus next 
month. 

[14:24] <doctorzzz> its a quest item 

[14:24] <marshmelons> rottr on pc is just the 360 port upscaled, gta vice city had better textures than that trash 
[14:24] <me_god> ass > resolution 

[14:24] <stuart360> But he;'s the reason why we have the 'PC master race' stuff, because of people like him 
[14:24] <bethemadeagle> isnt this PS exclusive though 
[14:24] <vendatus> yes 

[14:24] <azotherian> PS Exclusive = will be released for the other consoles next year 
[14:24] <bobbi_ling> all ps exclusives are casul single player games LUL 
[14:24] <popsicolo> Apparently they even rendered the grass under the snow. 

[14:24] <marshmelons> pc is so good everyone would rather watch console games 

[14:24] <breath321> @BetheMadEagle We’re talking about the PC version of Rottr I think, but idk if this is ps 
exclusive 

[14:24] <roguepixy> you know you can hide in the grass, the sparkly ones by crouching 

[14:25] <me_god> @Azotherian only Japanese ps exclusives 

[14:25] <bethemadeagle> PS exclusives are actually good though so its ok 
[14:25] <doctorzzz> RIP 

[14:25] <vendatus> next week D2 die the following week Okami HD VoHiYo 

[14:25] <marshmelons> rottr wasnt even open world and they still couldnt make the snow look good 

[14:25] <bethemadeagle> also most dont get cancelled 

[14:25] <breath321> I wanted to get a PS4 to play Bloodborne but since it's locked at 30fps I don't think tis worth 

[14:25] <me_god> #thisisnotdarksouls 

[14:25] <bobbi_ling> bloodborne is worst souls game 
[14:26] <scoopula> bloodborne isn’t a souls game 

[14:26] <stuart360> Playstation exclusives over the last 18months have been good to be fair. I jus6t think Sony 



fans need to remember that 95% of games released are multiplatform. 

[14:26] <breath321> Plus I don't wanna pay the price of a PS4 for a Bloodborne machine, I don't care for any of 

the other PS4 exclusives 

[14:26] <bobbi_hng> as i said 

[14:26] <bobbi_Hng> worst souls game 

[14:26] <doctorzzz> the difficulty they added for the die is really cool, ultra hard is really punishing 
[14:26] <marshmelons> why doesnt phil play the big pc exclusives that just came out? like...urn...nvm 
[14:26] <kinggrub73> Hey, Bloodborne is 100 % awesome, worth the price of the console by itself. 

[14:26] <me_god> nvm? 

[14:26] <darkone667> bloodborne nominated gotye 

[14:26] <scoopula> doesn't make sense, but I wouldn’t expect anything else 
[14:26] <azotherian> I have just started to play through DS1 on steam 
[14:27] <bobbMing> bloodborne had very bad pvp for a souls game 
[14:27] <azotherian> and I just killed the wolf 
[14:27] <roguepixy> stealth kill from red grass 

[14:27] <bethemadeagle> stuart yes i understand that and i also understand that oc is always going to be better 
but that doesnt mean PS or XBONE cant try their best 

[14:27] <breath321> @marshmelons PC has had a lot more exclusives than both consoles throughout the years, 

not that you know that, or was serious about your comment though 

[14:27] <popsicolo> Bloodborne PVP was swell. Cannon meta. popsicSmug 

[14:27] <doctorzzz> well all fututr xbox games are on pc anyway 

[14:27] <thesupervillain543> when is bloodborne 2 coming 

[14:27] <marshmelons> only exclusive game on pc is the waiting game 

[14:27] <scoopula> there are no exclusive PC games, only early access beta tests you pay for 

[14:27] <breath321> Most FPS games are basically PC exclusives since using keyboard and mouse on console is 

bannable since it's basically cheating 

[14:28] <me_god> crysis 

[14:28] <lvlpower> @thesupervillain543 new year 

[14:28] <direwolfsif> Phil could buy way more powerful weapons with all those shards 

[14:28] <azotherian> @Breath321 I wouldn't waste your username on marsh because he doesn't understand that 
console are essentially lower grade PCs 

[14:28] <bethemadeagle> microsoft own pc and xbone so yeah pc and xbone exclusive instead of just xbone 

[14:28] <popsicolo> The birds are chirping RlyTho 

[14:28] <marshmelons> pc is bad even the mobile port of pubg runs better 

[14:28] <stuart360> I'm only messing a bit Bethe, i just find Sony fanboys have been obnoxious over the last 4 
years. 

[14:28] <lvlpower> @thesupervillain543 Next year 

[14:28] <breath321> @Azotherian Yeah I know, but someone might believe the shit he's spouting, so I just 
responded to clear it up 

[14:28] <bobbi_ling> i wanna play dbd on pc so i can be the best nurse in the world dspCowboy 

[14:28] <scoopula> It comes with the territory of having the best console 

[14:28] <bethemadeagle> stuart ok 

[14:29] <bethemadeagle> bobbi then buy it simple 

[14:29] <bobbi_ling> console fps dspEw 

[14:29] <marshmelons> pcfanboys literally get offended by games they cant play, kinda sad 
[14:29] <wxrxaxtxh> Xbox is the best box. 

[14:29] <breath321> @Bobbi_Ling Playing FPS with a controller is like playing Street Fighter with a keyboard, 
literally unplayable 

[14:29] <azotherian> @marshmelons tbh, console gamers get upset when they have their games locked at 30fps 
[14:29] <bethemadeagle> wrath why you gotta say these things starting a console war now 
[14:29] <me_god> marsh is distracting the chat on purpose 

[14:30] <marshmelons> this game would be on pc if pcs were powerful enough to play it. 



[14:30] <stuart360> Sony fanboys need to remember the first 2 years of this gane when we had all the 'PS4 has 
no games' memes. This stuff goes in cycles. 

[14:30] <azotherian> @WxRxAxTxH nu-uh! The Xbox 360/2 is the best! 

[14:30] <me_god> it's an anti-dsp cospiracy 

[14:30] <breath321> @me_god agreed 

[14:30] <bobbi_ling> hey ps4 had knack Kappa 

[14:30] <bethemadeagle> DIE DIE DIE dumb birds 

[14:30] <marshmelons> xbone had no games for the first two years. 

[14:30] <thesupervillain543> this game is an L 
[14:30] <scoopula> xbone has no games now 

[14:30] <bethemadeagle> bobbi knack 1 was good i boycotted knack 2 

[14:31] <stuart360> And DriveClub Bobbi, oh how i enjoyed their salt all over the bad reviews that game got lol 

[14:31] <me_god> how do you do slow motion here? 

[14:31] <scoopula> click in the right thumbstick 

[14:31] <djrunol> damn dude the game is very very loud during action 

[14:31] <bethemadeagle> drive club was shit though 

[14:31] <marshmelons> cant be as bad as super luckys tale, the mario odyssey killer 
[14:31] <bobbi_ling> LUL

[14:32] <thesupervillain543> youre very very loud during ur mom LUL 

[14:32] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil do you like the game more because of thr DLC or unsure ? 

[14:32] <stuart360> Yes Bethe but fanboys acted like it was an amazing game and the reviews were wrong etc. 

[14:32] <me_god> wow she crafter 30 arrows during combat! what a champ 

[14:32] <bethemadeagle> fanboys will fanboy 
[14:32] <me_god> crafted

[14:34] <azotherian> @zaxbys_sauce nahp because people always want to show their e-peens 
[14:34] <bobbi_ling> this game starts wars in chat, turn it off 

[14:34] <marshmelons> its really fun especially the bikes they added, plus no lootboxes and me 

[14:34] <breath321> @zaxbys_sauce Marshmellow is the only console war person, wouldn't call one person

[14:35] <azotherian> @me_god no, they are sticky 

[14:35] <marshmelons> pc fanboys just get so triggered whenever phil plays a ps4 exclusive, theyre like the 
manlets of gaming 

[14:35] <paddingtonbearl87> sounds yummy 
[14:35] <bobbi_ling> her hair should be snowy dspHmm

something funny, that bait would get many more people 

[14:39] <paddingtonbearl87> i wonder how many marshmellows he can stuff in his mouth at once 
[14:39] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Sell your One X 30fps and get a 1080. enjoy 
[14:39] <paddingtonbearl87> mskkF 

[14:39] <azotherian> @Breath321 maybe he should say he has a girlfriend, that would really add to the trolling 
bait 

[14:39] <bammbino> @BetheMadEagle what do you rank higher., this or ACO? 

[14:39] <mrcuban305> what is the game about? 

[14:39] <me_god> fucking snow

[14:40] <doctorzzz> imo this game was way better than aco 



[14:40] <doctorzzz> story was good and not so repetetive gameplay 
[14:40] <doctorzzz> also combat is good 

[14:40] <bethemadeagle> but assassins creed origins cause i like assassins creed too much 
[14:40] <marshmelons> i still cant believe this is on hardware that cost 200. a pc at that price wouldnt even be 
able to run a psl emulator 
[14:40] <katexo234> dspFun

[14:41] <bammbino> @marshmelons in house studios get the most funding 

[14:42] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @marshmelons true, my 1070 can’t get 20fps on Sega megadrive games on 
Steam 

[14:42] <bammbino> @marshmelons this engine is for HZD ground up but will be used in death's stranding and 
more! sony coughed up alot of $$$$ 

[14:42] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> it wouldn't handle this shit 

[14:42] <bethemadeagle> you kill enemies they spawn more you hurt enemies they heal em so towers need to be 
taken out or overrided first

[14:46] <theycallmejimbob> Solidus beat the system :o 

[14:47] <kushiyakitori> @Bammbino giving himself a challenge I guess, which is probably not ideal since the 

enemies are a bit tougher here and the quests go beyond his level 

[14:47] <marshmelons> its gonna be so entertaining when he gets to a later mission 

[14:47] <bammbino> speaking of challenge., i’d love to see phil return to Nioh LOL

[14:47] <me_god> no he just goes for the strategy he’s more comfortable with, and forgets everything else in

greatest goal of all time

[15:19] <markymark52> no crafting 
[15:19] <markymark52> I believe 

[15:19] <marshmelons> @DarksydePhil you need to buy it from a merchant, it require 10 fatty meat 
[15:19] <cookiemanster530> And EA says that gamers don’t like Single Player games as much these days 
[15:19] <bethemadeagle> ascii dick pics lagging up my stream fucking trolls 
[15:19] <markymark52> no faty meat I was mistaken. 

[15:19] <markymark52> from merchant 
[15:20] <oakslsapws> you get it from a merchant 

[15:20] <stuart360> Studios want to brainwash you into believing that people dont care about single player 
games anymore. Its just easier for them to sell MP die and microtransactions 
[15:20] <cookiemanster530> Pretty much 

[15:20] <bethemadeagle> YOU NEED TO BUY THE GOLDEN FAST TRAVEL PACK FROM STORE 
[15:20] <bethemadeagle> im late :( 

[15:21] <cookiemanster530> That's why Bethesda won't make Elder Scrolls 6 for another 10 years. They make 

enough milking Skyrim 

[15:21] <sethl89> same, what's up everyone 

[15:21] <oakslsapws> why doesnt he get any new skills? 

[15:21] <deepdrive3254> that sucks bethe :( 

[15:21] <bethemadeagle> i dont mean late for stream i meant late to tell phil but hey seth 

[15:21] <stuart360> To be fair, the orig version of Skyrim sold like 25mil coppies. Ridiculous for that type of 

game 

[15:21] <sethl89> oh lol but heyo 

[15:21] <deepdrive3254> yeah i haven't checked my whispers in about a month 
[15:21] <cookiemanster530> I wish they'd make another Elder Scrolls like Daggerfall 
[15:21] <bethemadeagle> stuart it was hype at the time 

[15:22] <shega_ace> they keep re releasing it but i don't think much of it, still played it but wasn’t wow 
[15:22] <bethemadeagle> deep it does suck and it freezes the damn stream and chat so i cant do shit 
[15:22] <oakslsapws> this die is quite hard 

[15:22] <stuart360> 25mil copies for a RPG series that started on the PC. Its pretty crazy Bethe in todays world 
of COD, GTA and FPS games 
[15:23] <bethemadeagle> true stuart 

[15:23] <cookiemanster530> I wish that COD would go away tbh 
[15:23] <cookiemanster530> I don’t see the appeal 

[15:24] <bethemadeagle> the appeal is kid fanboying over it and begging parents to buy it for em every year 

[15:24] <zaxbys_sauce> cod sucks now 

[15:24] <goldencolts> cheer 100 

[15:24] <zaxbys_sauce> Bo2 was the last good one 

[15:24] <shega_ace> so i've been living under a rock for this game what is this game roughly about i'm getting 
Fallout vibes 

[15:24] <bethemadeagle> and parents give in and get it for em day 1 
[15:24] <stuart360> COD2 is still my fave lol 

[15:24] <cookiemanster530> I like that chics hair, but damn she could use some make up. 

[15:25] <oakslsapws> its about humans going back to the stone age 
[15:25] <bethemadeagle> they get the 150 bucks game with collectibles and everything :D 
[15:25] <deepdrive3254> thats why when i play cod i find 5 year olds yelling in their mic bethe 
[15:25] <katexo234> TPFufun TPFufun 



[15:25] <lvlpower> @bethemadeagle That ture on release date all mom bought call of duty for there kids 
[15:25] <bethemadeagle> deep yes 

[15:25] <above7waves> This is some great commentary. Highly entertaining stuff. I can’t believe you suckers 
pay for this clown to live 5Y~, 

[15:25] <cookiemanster530> Lmao 

[15:25] <bethemadeagle> kate will buy cod for her kids when she has some and they grow up 
[15:25] <stuart360> lol that $100 tip triggered the trolls, just like clockwork 
[15:25] <katexo234> *dances with Deep_Drive * 

[15:25] <marshmelons> thia 
[15:25] <zaxbys_sauce> detractor alert 
[15:26] <zaxbys_sauce> dispatch the dood bots 
[15:26] * bethemadeagle dances in the mooooooonlight 

[15:26] <marshmelons> this guy is the best fighting game player in Connecticut 
[15:26] <katexo234> bethe no I won’t I don’t think kids should be playing cod 
[15:26] <bethemadeagle> kate but your kid willl beg you for it 

[15:26] <stuart360> Its funny reading that troll pos, i mean he must of been watching himself to even know 

about the tip. Dumbass 

[15:26] <cookiemanster530> lol 

[15:26] <katexo234> I don’t care bethe no means no 

[15:27] <m arshm el ons> sok really are pathetic. 

[15:27] <sethl89> i wouldn’t mind kids playing COD as long as they were mature but it seems maturity is a dime 
a dozen these days 

[15:27] <popsicolo> This is what Fallout 4 could've looked like if Bethesda used a good engine. 

[15:27] <bethemadeagle> kate what if your kid steals your credit card and buys it their self when you not looking 
[15:27] <stuart360> SOK dont even exist anymore. Phil outlived them, oh the irony lol 
[15:27] <theycallmejimbob> :o BetheMadEagle 

[15:28] <sethl89> yeah lol, or didnt take away almost all rpg elements :,( 

[15:28] <bethemadeagle> jim it could happen 

[15:28] <katexo234> well bethe they are are getting an ass whoppin 

[15:28] <popsicolo> No skill checks NotLikeThis 

[15:28] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[15:28] <sethl89> YEAH like wtf 

[15:28] <sethl89> no skills 

[15:28] <sethl89> no traits either, premade backstory and only 4 dialogue options at a time 
[15:28] <bethemadeagle> what i would do is grab the damn disc and make em watch it burn 
[15:29] <deepdrive3254> an ass whoopin of a lifetime kate and wouldn’t be able to enjoy whatever they bought 
[15:29] <cookiemanster530> All fallout games have a pre made backstory. 

[15:29] <deepdrive3254> i don’t understand how some parents think their kids stealing from them is no big deal 
[15:29] <sethl89> not to the extent of fallout 4 
[15:29] <katexo234> deep LUL LUL 

[15:30] <popsicolo> "You can be a soldier or a lawyer"-Todd Howard popsicSmug 

[15:30] <bethemadeagle> a ass whoopin lets them have the game still so making em watch it burn into dust will 
teach them not to do it and they wont have anything to play 
[15:30] <lvlpower> Sonny Strait 
[15:30] <businessdude> thsi a DLC? 

[15:30] <popsicolo> Yes. 

[15:30] <businessdude> tnx 
[15:30] <lvlpower> yes 

[15:30] <sethl89> lol and sadly those are the only options, you could use the alternate start mod but it doesn’t 
matter because the story is set behind finding ur son the whole time which sucks donkey ass 
[15:30] <deepdrive3254> LUL 
[15:31] <deepdrive3254> that was a bad idea 



[15:31] <bethemadeagle> but in fallout 3 you was looking for your dad the whole game 
[15:31] <sethl89> LUL 
[15:31] <deepdrive3254> almost 

[15:31] <sethl89> yep, i have the same story gripe with fallout 3 in addition to fallout 4 

[15:32] <chaosalltheway> this part sucks DansGame 

[15:32] <katexo234> @popsicolo where did you get the idea to nam 

[15:32] <popsicolo> "My dad is Liam Neeson. He's probably fine. Lets go fight aliens and also go to Pittsburgh" 

-The Lone Wanderer 

[15:32] <zaxbys_sauce> conn orn gord88 

[15:32] <deepdrive3254> yes swing your sword phil 

[15:32] <stuart360> To be fair to Bthesda, i dont know many people that play Elder Scrolls and Fallout for the 
stopry, its all about the side content. The story missions make up like 5-10% of the game 
[15:32] <katexo234> jump Phil jump LUL 

[15:33] <bethemadeagle> i play skyrim and fallout for all the fun side missions and they have a lot 
[15:33] <chaosalltheway> you need to go up 

[15:33] <popsicolo> I didn’t want a name with a bunch of random letters and numbers Kate so I made a 
username that almost sounds like something @katexo234 

[15:33] <sethl89> that's why i preferred new vegas because with an alternate start mod, the story was so loose 
you ccould start off in allegiance with a faction and beat the game with them or do it yourself or mr house it 
didn’t matter you had the freedom of choice which i loved 

[15:33] <bethemadeagle> and in skyrim and fallout 3 and 4 i completed most of em 
[15:33] <chaosalltheway> danPuke 

[15:33] <bethemadeagle> i also did the story which was ok 
[15:33] <bethemadeagle> and i viewed all the endings 

[15:34] <sethl89> yeah the story in fallout 3 3i just ignored and love the game, but with 4 i just can't due to the 

lack of rpg elements and mediocre shooting 

[15:34] <bethemadeagle> my name dont have numbers 

[15:34] <sethl89> they just took 1 step forward and 3 steps back which sucks 

[15:34] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[15:34] <popsicolo> Very cerebral popsicSmug 

[15:35] <shega_ace> what are the enemies in this game?

[16:07] <thatanonybear> there"s a wet effect, but it only triggers when she hears Phil talking dspSexy 
[16:07] <marshmelons> it plays better than tomb raider, you can at least roll in this 
[16:08] <thatanonybear> @theycallmejimbob you like weezer? nice! PogChamp 

[16:08] <dukaduka> because it's rise of the tomb raider but instead of being a girl with a lot to live up to raiding 
tombs, you are a girl with a lot to live up to raiding tombs AND hunting machines

[16:11] <theycallmejimbob> :o BetheMadEagle that sounds like you 
[16:11] <breath321> Yeah I also thought this game was nothing special 
[16:11] <bethemadeagle> jim i know 
[16:11] <bammbino> @BetheMadEagle KappaPride ??? 

[16:12] <marshmelons> its way better than tomb raider and far cry though 
[16:12] <djrunol> it is a non-sexualized female protagonist phil. it is game of the millenium 
[16:12] <bethemadeagle> gimme humble pie already 20 mins left he isnt dying 8 more times 
[16:12] <bethemadeagle> bammbino :P 

[16:12] <stuart360> Phil saying what i said earlier, a certain fanbase always overhypes their exclusives 
[16:12] <breath321> @marshmelons In your opinion, in most peoples opinion it isn't, since the game is so 
ignored by most people 

[16:12] * theycallmejimbob gives BetheMadEagle humble pie 

[16:12] <dooley258> Oh yeah you get bonus gear if you complete sets of collectibles 

[16:12] <pinkdam> does aloy put anyone else in mind of leonardo dicaprio? 

[16:12] * thatanonybear snores in Eagle’s ears 

[16:12] <marshmelons> most people actually agree considering it scored higher on metacritic 
[16:12] <bammbino> @Breath321 ?????? dude the game was compared to Witcher 3 and still is 
[16:12] <bethemadeagle> stuart but in this case it was true 
[16:13] <bammbino> @Breath321 i highly doubt you own this game 

[16:13] <blue_blur64> @Breath321 It's still a GOTY nominee, so it must've done something right 

[16:13] <chaosalltheway> It really is W3 

[16:13] <bethemadeagle> fine bear i wont be near you 

[16:13] <thatanonybear> :/ 

[16:13] <blue_blur64> Although I don’t think it deserves the spot when Breath of the Wild is right there 
[16:13] <marshmelons> and its a goty nominee, while xbox has nothing 

[16:13] <uncircumcisedjevv> cheerlO @DarksydePhil do you worry about your eye sight? have you heard 
about gunner glasses? 

[16:13] <bammbino> @marshmelons hit the nail on the head! 

[16:14] * bethemadeagle goes and puts sound cancelling earphones on and cozies up to bear 
[16:14] <blue_blur64> oh yeah, 4 out of 5 games this year for nominees are all exclusives xD 
[16:14] <stuart360> Big budget AAA game gets nominated for awards, well i never 
[16:14] <zaxbys_sauce> oh here we go again 
[16:14] <kushiyakitori> console war chats are the worst lol 

[16:14] * thatanonybear makes up with Eagle, then makes out with Eagle KappaPride 
[16:14] <bethemadeagle> mmhmm 

[16:14] <breath321> @Bammbino Lmao I don’t own it because I've seen a lot of people play it and thought it 
was mediocre at best, chill, this is all subjective, I'm not claiming to have the correct opinion or anything 
[16:14] <popsicolo> I just use f.lux at night. 

[16:14] <marshmelons> no nominee for divinity a pc exclusive lol 
[16:14] <blue_blur64> We were doing a console war? nappyThink 
[16:14] <kushiyakitori> @blue_blur64 is that a new emote? 

[16:14] <djrunol> @Uncircumcised_Jevv phil should be worried about his eyesight, yesterday in hidden agenda 
he was looking for footprints on the wall and ceiling, he is blind af 
[16:15] <dukaduka> maybe you should update your glasses OpieOP 
[16:15] <dukaduka> @DJRunol OpieOP 

[16:15] <chaosalltheway> another dumb white man danTriggered 

[16:15] <blue_blur64> yup, came out yesterday. Everyone was spamming it in excitement :P 




[16:15] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil you gotta admit that HZD came out at a good time tho.. February-March is 
usually a DEAD month for games 

[16:15] <kushiyakitori> @blue_blur64 nice, didn't even know 

[16:15] <stuart360> Divinty is actually a really good RPG, but a game like that will never get nominated, not 
enough money and hype behind it 

[16:15] <marshmelons> if persona 5 can get a nomination anything can. people just dont care about pc games 
[16:15] <dukaduka> if pubg wins goty, it will end the console wars once and for all 

[16:15] <kushiyakitori> most PC exclusives are never really hyped. PCs are celebrated for a lot of other things 
instead 

[16:16] <bammbino> bammbino says " oh fuck" LOL 
[16:16] <dooley258> Mario is probably going to win goty 

[16:16] <blue_blur64> duka, even the devs think other games deserve it more than they do :P 

[16:16] <bammbino> LMFAO 

[16:16] <chaosalltheway> LUL 

[16:16] <zaxbys_sauce> Mario should win 

[16:16] <bammbino> dspGlitch dspGlitch 

[16:16] <theycallmejimbob> dspGlitch 

[16:16] <marshmelons> the main problem is all the pc gamers spend more time watching console games cos 

they re just better 

[16:16] <dukaduka> GLITCH 

[16:16] <thatanonybear> NITW GOTY All Year Every Year 
[16:16] <breath321> Is marshmelons still trying to bait? Jesus christ 
[16:16] <blue_blur64> brownLUL 

[16:16] <stuart360> Marshmellow plese sont start again lol 

[16:16] <dukaduka> @ThatAnonyBear it probably will win indie game of the year (i think its nominated) 

[16:17] <marshmelons> only trolls think this game is bad. your bait is worse 
[16:17] <breath321> I left and came back and he's still at it 

[16:17] <blue_blur64> Ok, now marshmelons is really trying to start a console war xD

[16:17] <bammbino> @BetheMadEagle one thing this game has over ACO is animations! aco has some cool 
ones but got old quick 

[16:17] <zaxbys_sauce> fl3 may win since its popular 
[16:17] <kuronbohanta> this is fucking shit LUL 
[16:17] <thatanonybear> no 2nd stream :( 

[16:17] <bethemadeagle> true bammbino 

[16:17] <stuart360> He actuially stopped trolling, but Phil said this game is average so he’s triggered again 
[16:17] <nightbot> Th3g4m310v3r just tipped $1.00 

[16:17] <dukaduka> @ThatAnonyBear i just know of the game awards but there are probably a lot more 
nominations for it, including music 

[16:17] <marshmelons> i dont anything, i only respond when i see poeple talking shit. 

[16:18] <chaosalltheway> Gotta admit this is better than TR DansGame 
[16:18] <kushiyakitori> People like different stuff. It happens lol 
[16:18] <bethemadeagle> bear phil need to get hair cut man 
[16:18] <stuart360> Phil speaks the truth 

[16:18] <bammbino> i dont think phil wil touch BF1 ever again after that lag fiasco 

[16:18] <blue_blur64> However, Zelda coming out a week after made the hype die down a bit 

[16:18] <breath321> "only trolls think this game is bad" Yeah, just call anyone that has a different opinion trolls 

and ignore them, that's a good mentality to have. 

[16:18] <marshmelons> pc fanboys still here getting upset over a game they cant play, pathetic lniao 



[16:18] <bammbino> sigh., how low DICE has fallen 

[16:18] <infamousecondson> Hey phil, which episodic game will you play first? 

[16:18] <chaosalltheway> he was 

[16:18] <thatanonybear> @BetheMadEagle ahh, new girlfriend likes short hair NotLikeThis 

[16:19] <kushiyakitori> they already give you the idea of what you'll get if you do this mission 

[16:19] <marshmelons> just call anything you disagree with bait and stay oblivious to your own hypocrisy 

[16:19] <bethemadeagle> silent nope nintendo games dont affect ps4 exclusive 

[16:19] <bethemadeagle> bear hmm 

[16:19] <dukaduka> incoming Jebaited 

[16:19] <breath321> @marshmelons The difference is the stuff you're saying is factually incorrect, it's not a 
different opinion, if s just wrong, the things about PC games looking worse than console ones 
[16:19] <blue_blur64> Oh yeah, I forgot that this game is an exclusive. I thought it was multiplatform for some 
reason 

[16:19] <kushiyakitori> I bought both and enjoyed both 
[16:19] <bethemadeagle> i got both too 
[16:19] <dooley258> I love the backstory of this game 
[16:19] <marshmelons> this troll still baiting 

[16:19] <breath321> But whatever, at this point I'm just taking the bait 

[16:19] <uncircumcisedjevv> cheerlO @DarksydePhil If I wanted to send you a present for Christmas, do you 
have shipping address? 

[16:20] <stuart360> Phil literally saying everything i said earlier, Phil knows his stuff 
[16:20] <chaosalltheway> 5 min loadings tho 
[16:20] <gato_twitch> WHY AM I TOXIC ?? 

[16:20] <deepdrive3254> right this is a ps4 exclusive...thats why bobbi constantly shits on it whenever it comes 
up 

[16:20] <bammbino> @stuart360 did you get nioh for pc? 

[16:20] <stuart360> Yep Bammbino 

[16:20] <dukaduka> @dooley258 i like the post apocalyptic restart, but the characters in this game, excuse my 
language, are ass 

[16:20] <stuart360> Haven’t finished it though 

[16:21] <marshmelons> friendly reminder, dps goty for 2016 was uncharted 4. another ps4 exclusive, thats gotta 
hurt 

[16:21] <bammbino> @stuart360 is it everything you thought i’d be for PC or were you let down by controls 
and/or port issues? 

[16:21] <popsicolo> This guy's nip isn't pointy enough for what he's wearing and where he is. 

[16:21] <chaosalltheway> great dialogues danLol 
[16:21] <blue_blur64> and then the gift is actual shit Kappa 

[16:21] <stuart360> Well i have a decent PC so i could brute force the game. I used a 360 controller as well so 
had no real control problems 

[16:22] <bammbino> @marshmelons alot of the game franchies that Phil has covered during his entire legacy on 
YT often hit hit GOTY list 

[16:22] <bammbino> @marshmelons he had issues with ACO, but i doubt he’d drop it from 2017’s goty list 
[16:22] <breath321> @Bammbino NFS Payback will be Goty Kappa 
[16:23] <bammbino> @stuart360 thats good man, i am hapy you were able to finally play it 
[16:23] <bammbino> @Breath321 LMFAO 

[16:23] <stuart360> I really like Uncharted Marshmellow, although i still think Uncharted 2 is the best 
[16:23] <rorke47> when's bloodborne? 

[16:23] <kushiyakitori> I think Uncharted 2 is the best as well 

[16:23] <blue_blur64> stuart, did you know you can use PS4 controllers with steam now? :P 
[16:23] <chaosalltheway> @Rorke47 Bmaco plan to announce new games on 15th dec 
[16:23] <blue_blur64> nobody was talking about Bloodborne Rorke 

[16:23] <marshmelons> i think the vehicles and the swinging mechanic make uncharted 4 more fun 



[16:24] <stuart360> It is unoptimized on PC thopugh Bammbino, as usual for us PC gamers. Thankfully a good 

gpu can brute force the game 

[16:24] <bethemadeagle> uncharted 4 is the best 

[16:24] <rorke47> no i’m wondering when phil's doing his bloodborne redemption run 
[16:24] <chaosalltheway> never danLol 

[16:24] <blue_blur64> He never said he was doing one though... 

[16:24] <rorke47> oh ok 

[16:24] <chaosalltheway> salt is till strong in him 

[16:25] <bethemadeagle> he prob will 

[16:25] <dukaduka> did he not finish bloodborne? 

[16:25] <rorke47> i really want to see him beat ludwig 

[16:25] <stuart360> I didn’t like that there seemed to be a lot less action in Uncharted 4, especially compared to 

the gauntlets in Uncharted 2 and the 2nd half of Uncharted 3 

[16:25] <blue_blur64> He did beat bloodborne, just not the die 

[16:25] <gamemaster2003isdead> cheerlO am i late 

[16:25] <dukaduka> @Rorke47 yeah that's not happening 

[16:25] <chaosalltheway> not beating the best die on PS4 is a crime tho 

[16:25] <breath321> What is Phil playing on his second stream btw?

[16:35] <thatanonybear> let's not mention old one, and have some tact when talking about new gf 
[16:35] <goldencolts> cheerlOO 

[16:36] <breath321> @ThatAnonyBear Why not mention the old one though? 

[16:38] <thatanonybear> because they've both moved on, and this isn’t the platform to discuss her in retrospect 
[16:39] <breath321> fair enough I guess, I'm just kind of bothered by how Phil calls her "My ex" or "My then 
girlfriend" instead of calling her by her name lmao 
[16:39] <businessdude> I miss her tho 

[16:39] <breath321> Like it was always "Leanna My Girlfriend" instead of just Leanna 
[16:40] <businessdude> @Breath321 phil loves using adjectives words
