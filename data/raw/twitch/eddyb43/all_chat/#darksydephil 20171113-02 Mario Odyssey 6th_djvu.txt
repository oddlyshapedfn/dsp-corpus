[19:51] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84RxK4NlwfE 
[19:51] <samrlaseter> @theasianentrepreneur yeah but stupidly high income tax. Would prefer no sales tax over 
9% of my income getting stolen 

[19:51] <sprank_n> @DarksydePhil People on the subreddit posted links that showed a number of cancelled pre 
orders of the game lol 
[19:52] <nolbert87> holy fuck 

[19:52] <sirnoblex> Yeah, one of the most disliked comment on reddit. 

[19:52] <nolbert87> what cunts 

[19:52] <haikugay> @Sprank_N Pretty sure it was like 70,000 cancelled pre orders last time I saw lol

[19:52] <sprank_n> @haikugay thats what i saw too

credits for completing campaign and stuff

[19:53] <vendatus> yeah getting death threats is funny 5Y‘ □ □ 

[19:53] <sprank_n> @DarksydePhil apparently around 70,000 pre orders were cancelled within a day 
[19:53] <theasianentrepreneur> Hey fuck @SamRLaseter in BC its 12% sales tax plus $7000 Property Tax on a 
$1 mil home. AND since we are a liberal province and govt income tax is rape. 

[19:53] <eternia_forever> got that fast knowledge @ThatAnonyBear 

[19:53] <haikugay> EA is a business not some indie dev funding a passion project on kickstarter, of course 
they’d rather nickel and dime us rather than make something good 

[19:53] <nukacolaking> I'm getting battlefront 2 for less than $30 anyways so Im getting it anyways :P 
[19:53] <bentboxer> they are making dies free in bf2, trying to make all the revenue off microtransactions

console for nintendo.

[20:21] <haikugay> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Thats what they get for doing Australia dirty back in 06 
[20:21] <kingjezal> @Eternia_Forever Yes, I did. I spent 317 hours on it (more than any other single 
playthrough for me). It would be awesome if he played 2. 

[20:21] <6th_moral> More like, that BLOWS for Mario! 

[20:21] <nazzrax> @6th_Moral haHAA 

[20:21] <doctorzzz> well only thing that can stop germany in cups is italy so glad they are not qualified this time

years. 

[20:23] <doctorzzz> well germany never wins against them in the cups it our nemesis 

[20:23] <darthradovanviking> i don't even care so much but it hurts when my country looses 2-0 against 

Macedonia 

[20:23] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[20:23] <kingjezal> @Eternia_Forever I liked it a lot, but it was not as good as the original Xenoblade. The 
original had better story, characters, soundtrack, and maybe environments (it's close there). Gameplay (combat 
and side quests) is better in X though. 

[20:23] <neospartanhesperos9> Viking, how does it feel your neighbors Sweden qualified for the World Cup

[20:24] <doctorzzz> last 4 years they really stepped it up 

[20:25] <thatanonybear> this music reminds me a lot of Danganronpa 2 

[20:25] <neospartanhesperos9> @DarthRadovanViking Is there rivalry in Norway with any of the Scandinavian 
countries, or any kind of bad history between each other 

[20:25] <kingjezal> @Eternia_Forever He actually never finished it. He quit about halfway through. 

[20:25] <bentboxer> america has 300 million people and the men cant qualify for the world cup FeelsBadMan 
[20:25] <nazzrax> @KingJezal wtf is wrong with u??? 

[20:25] <doctorzzz> well they were kicked out on unfortunte shit 
[20:25] <6th_moral> What did he quit @KingJezal ? 

[20:26] <darthradovanviking> yeah not since like the late 1800 though. I like to think denmark and norway is 
united against Sweden. But it is because I am half danish 

[20:26] <thatanonybear> @bentboxer because there's more money in baseball, football, and basketball :P 
[20:26] <haikugay> @bentboxer do you guys have to qualify against South American teams though? 

[20:26] <kingjezal> @6th_Moral The first Xenoblade. 

[20:26] <eternia_forever> ohhhhhhhh shit he did i did not know that, to difficult or lack of views if you 
remember ? @KingJezal 

[20:26] <kingjezal> @Nazzrax I still don't know what you're referring to... 

[20:26] <doctorzzz> FISA should be in the cup bit that phantom goal FUF 

[20:26] <mizorelover> I really love the music of Shiveria Town. So happy and cute, lol 

[20:26] <doctorzzz> rip 

[20:26] <ratchefanl2> depends on who is in the group haiku 

[20:26] <ghostlyectoplasm> cheer20 i wish we knew how many times uve smacked marios head off of rocks 
lrnao 

[20:27] <kingjezal> @Eternia_Forever He said boredom, but that comment was spurred by there being too many 
cutscenes. The story really is amazing, so don’t judge it on that. 

[20:27] <nazzrax> @KingJezal yes you do... 

[20:27] <neospartanhesperos9> @bentboxer because there isn't funding for soccer cause the US doesn’t care, and 
the real passionate talent that can’t afford the jerseys or the costly tournament trips are hidden from scouts eyes, 
and the rich kids are the ones who get scouted. 

[20:27] <darthradovanviking> if he can't piss in the snow i am disapointed 
[20:27] <kingjezal> @Nazzrax I guess, but why are you singling me out? 

[20:27] <nolbert87> cheerlOO What two Nintendo or otherwise Characters would you like to see team up for a 
game? I think Mario and Kirby would be fun. 

[20:27] <thatanonybear> more concusssions than Dnaiel Bryan TearGlove 
[20:27] <haikugay> @ThatAnonyBear too soon 

[20:28] <neospartanhesperos9> @bentboxer Mexico finds the talent the US cant find and take them 
[20:28] <nazzrax> @KingJezal because of the last thing u said

[20:28] <kingjezal> @Nazzrax Oh.... Meager offering referred to my leftover bits right at the end. 

[20:28] <haikugay> I still do quiet yes chants through sobs at night 

[20:29] <eternia_forever> Alright well thanks as if i would have got invested into playthough i would have been 
pissed when i got to his last part to find out he did not finish the game lol @KingJezal

Characters 

[20:32] <eternia_forever> wow i see he had 103 parts too, i wonder how many it would have took to finish it, 
would you say he was half way through it ? @KingJezal 

[20:32] <neospartanhesperos9> I liked star fox assault, which they made more SF games like that 

[20:32] <haikugay> @KingJezal the open world was really well done but the shrines were a really shit substitute 

for dungeons 

[20:32] <dantemustdiee> trkH trkH 

[20:32] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Who misses King K Rool? 

[20:32] <haikugay> imo anyway 
[20:32] <frankenfunk> TPFufun 

[20:32] <kingjezal> @Eternia_Forever Yeah, about halfway through the game. The story is really long. 

[20:32] <vashyoyo> the snowmads in tropical freeze r better 
[20:32] <neospartanhesperos9> Fuck me and my typos FUF 

[20:33] <kingjezal> @haikugay The world had a lot of potential, and it was great in a lot of ways, but I still 
wasn’t satisfied with it most of the time.

[21:46] <bufbills5121 > ATL literally gave the game away 
[21:46] <kekon3> ResidentSleeper 
[21:46] <bentboxer> atlanta underestimated tom brady 

[21:47] <bufbills5121 > under 4 mins left in FG range and they just called ridiculously dumb play calls 
[21:47] <vashyoyo> fire ball can walk on land if they step on hot tomatoes 

[21:47] <theasianentrepreneur> @BufBills5121 celebrate to early, having the owner come down early Kappa 
only to get screwed over LOL 

[21:47] <bufbills5121 > no, the play calling was atrocious

[21:49] <bigdaddydubz> i wish i wouldent of beat this game so fast, 

[21:49] <bufbills5121> when brady retires in 2 years and pats go to shit for like 7 years people won’t know what 
to do 

[21:49] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> This boss looks like hea€™s good at splatoon 

[21:49] <theasianentrepreneur> @BufBills5121 that tyree catch was absolute luck, in any other alt universe that 
wouldve been picked or eli be sacked. 

[21:49] <bufbills5121 > i mean, but it happened 

[21:49] <bentboxer> he leads the league in passing yards and is carrying the team on his back with the shaky for 
now defense 

[21:49] <bufbills5121 > the edelman catch was luck too by that definition 
[21:50] <bufbills5121 > it should have been picked 

[21:50] <neospartanhesperos9> He was making magical graffiti that would summon a monster but failed 
BigPhish

[21:52] <theasianentrepreneur> hogan was lacrosse, edehnan is 7th rd qb 
[21:52] <theasianentrepreneur> system Kappa 

[21:52] <darthradovanviking> are they talking bullshit or are there any sense to what they are saying @bentboxer 
[21:52] <bufbills5121 > right, but edehnan has developed into a really good receiver
