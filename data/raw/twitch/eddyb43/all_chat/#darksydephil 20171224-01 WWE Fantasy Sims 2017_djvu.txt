[11:17] <theycallmejimbob> it's gonna lag like crazy dspHmm 

[11:17] <bethelewd> cahman 

[11:18] <bethelewd> dont say that 

[11:18] <darksydephil> wassap folks 

[11:18] <theycallmejimbob> hey Phil 

[11:18] <darksydephil> Merry Christmas Eve! 

[11:18] <bethelewd> im pre downloading my Christmas gifts which was vouchers i bought fifa and the LIS 
prequel 

[11:19] <theycallmejimbob> People have said there is a bit of slowdown when there are 8 wrestlers in the ring 
BeTheLewd dspHmm 

[11:19] <bethelewd> hey phil merry Christmas eve 
[11:19] <theycallmejimbob> Merry Christmas Eve Phil 
[11:19] <darksydephil> yeah i tested the royal rumble 
[11:19] <bethelewd> jim well they never did it before so haha 
[11:19] <darksydephil> the game dips from 60fps to 30fps 
[11:19] <darksydephil> and then it lags up 
[11:19] <darksydephil> its basically awful, they fucked it up lol 
[11:19] <darksydephil> so this should be interesting 
[11:19] <bethelewd> royal rumble match will be hilarious then 
[11:19] <bethelewd> laggy and funny 

[11:20] <theycallmejimbob> someone did a review of the switch version of WWE 2K18 it's an even worse port 
NotLikeThis 

[11:20] <darksydephil> its been what, 10 years, they can't figure out how to have more than 6 in the rumble at a 

time without the game chugging, thats pretty impressively bad lol 

[11:20] <bethelewd> watching santa getting thrown out oof the ring in slow mo :D 

[11:21] <bethelewd> phil this is the first time they had more than 3 in the ring at once though 

[11:21] <bethelewd> 6 

[11:21] <theycallmejimbob> I think one of the smackdown games here comes the pain it may have been had 8 

wrestlers in the ring 10 years ago dspHmm 

[11:21] <stratman 1909> prolly runs good on the pro 



[11:21] <bethelewd> j im really? 

[11:21] <bethelewd> well why did they change it back to 6 then 
[11:21] <bethelewd> hmmmmmmm 

[11:22] <bethelewd> fuck the pro the og ps4 is perfectly fine 
[11:22] <stratmanl909> i thought the fps dipped tho 
[11:23] <bethelewd> yeah so 

[11:23] <bethelewd> it would dip on the pro as well then 
[11:23] <stratmanl909> probably wouldnt dip on the pro 
[11:23] <stratmanl909> i mean crnon its the pro Kappa 

[11:24] <bethelewd> onlyone way to find out and that is get wwe on the pro and test the rumble and see what 
happens, i am not doing it and phil def wont 

[11:24] <darksydephil> okay im going to turn on the stream, then go grab drinks 

[11:24] <theycallmejimbob> there was definitely a PS2 game I think BeTheLewd that allowed 8 wrestlers in the 
ring dspHmm

[12:52] <bobbi_ling> code veronica is the best re 

[12:52] <bobbi_ling> fact 

[12:52] <bionich00t> eh, it's like top 5 imo 

[12:52] <bionich00t> below REmake and RE2 

[12:52] <bionich00t> maybe RE1 

[12:52] <bobbi_ling> remake isnt fair but its better than the rest 
[12:53] <bionich00t> RE2 is my favorite 

[12:53] <bionich00t> REmake and CV/RE1 below that, power gap then the rest 
[12:53] <kingofhypocrisy> Is Phil pressing buttons? 

[12:53] <iradiumviking> i think it is a fireplace sound effect 
[12:53] <sardarkh> He's handrawing the fighters 



[12:53] <beat43210> Fire cracking probably 

[12:53] <kingofhypocrisy> oh 

[12:54] <derichloveslemur> Fireplace cracking 

[12:54] <bobbi_ling> 2 had good jump scares with the licker. but veronica was better imo 

[12:54] <iradiumviking> or maybe his house is burning down or something 

[12:54] <arcticsurface> Fireplace sound Kreygasm 

[12:54] <bionich00t> CV would be the best if not for the BS 

[12:54] <derichloveslemur> It does sound like a fireplace 

[12:54] <two_bar_king> phils stoking the fire 

[12:54] <bionich00t> Like the metal detector, the bosses can be annoying, the story is a bit worse than RE imo 
[12:54] <bionich00t> But it's up there. 

[12:54] <petulant_stephen> Did he die? 

[12:54] <bionich00t> RE2*
