[12:20] <mecasheep> so what was the big annoiuncement yesterday? 

[12:20] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> nudnik tax attorney 
[12:21] <mecasheep> what? 

[12:24] <bethemadeagle> he has to pay thousands of dollars in tax 
[12:24] <bethemadeagle> his tax attorney fucked up 
[12:25] <mecasheep> oh shit 

[12:25] <mecasheep> why did he need an attorney in the first place? 

[12:25] <bethemadeagle> and phil might lose his house now 
[12:25] <mecasheep> poor guy 

[12:25] <bethemadeagle> for his taxes cause he cant do them himself so he needed one to do his taxes 
[12:26] <mecasheep> i hope he’ll get out of this situation good luck for him 

[12:26] <bethemadeagle> and some troll signed him up for every free business magazine and made it seem that 
he has his own business 

[12:26] <bethemadeagle> and that is the big ta he has to pay cause of that 
[12:27] <darksydephil> lol no surprise i arrive and this is what's being talked about 
[12:27] <darksydephil> i supposed it will be the hot topic for a bit 
[12:27] <bethemadeagle> well you did revela it yesterday so no surprise here 



[12:28] <mecasheep> you know what? i don’t even watch you stream not do i find it interresting but hat 
happened to you kinda suck no one deserves to loose his home 

[12:28] <darksydephil> yeah and it will probably take weeks for everyone to be in the loop, and people will keep 
asking, its part for the course

[12:28] <mecasheep> good luck pal 

[12:29] <bethemadeagle> i just hope it isnt that much of a ttax and that the pay plan works out 
[12:29] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea yet 

[12:29] <darksydephil> the tax attorney was assuming it would be around $5k but he has no idea what the 
interest, fees etc will end up being and if he can get them waived, and also if he gets on a payment plan for how 
long it would be 

[12:30] <darksydephil> so....yeah 

[12:30] <bethemadeagle> this is why i hate taxes and people behind it you cant trust em

[12:49] <goldencolts> someone set a wahnart in texas on fire 

[12:49] <bionichOOt> One thing I thought of Phil to solve your problems, why not rent out your spare room and 
ask for an upfront payment for the next few months? I know you might not find someone willing to do that, but 
that'd get you a few thousand easily if you could find someone willing to do it for less than normal rent. 
@DarksydePhil 

[12:49] <bethemadeagle> i went straight home after work im not staying out on black friday lol

[12:52] <aproxymate> @Bionich00t u sent the same message twice

[12:54] <blue_blur64> The other question is, will Sunshine be a 100% run? Kappa

[12:54] <paddingtonbearl87> how is phil gonna play sunshine? emulator? 

[12:55] <blue_blur64> With his old Wii paddington 
[12:55] <bionich00t> It's not that rare phsyical 

[12:55] <tormentedmayhem 17> PUBG is poorly optimized, i wouldn’t say it's garbage though. 

[12:55] <paddingtonbearl87> ah ok 

[12:55] <kinggoken> i agree it is poorly optimized 

[12:55] <paddingtonbearl87> ty 

[12:55] <maminas> i think he will play it on wii? im not sure 

[12:55] <blue_blur64> That's the only way he can play it without emulating it maminas 

[12:55] <paddingtonbearl87> yeah 

[12:55] <katexo234> salty Saturday oh boy the rage begin 

[12:55] <vendatus> Salty Saturday dspShock 

[12:56] <enzio814> Better than "Shooter Saturday" lol 

[12:56] <blue_blur64> Fortunately I should be here a little more often now that work is slowing down and the 

Sonic Hacking Contest streams are done for this year :P

[12:56] <katexo234> bethe he did rage on star wars 
[12:57] <bethemadeagle> when 

[12:57] <blue_blur64> In no order, Unleashed, Generations, Adventure 2 
[12:57] <encelor> first 
[12:57] <vendatus> always 

[12:57] <blue_blur64> They're my personal best btw 
[12:57] <encelor> first playthrough of online battlefront 2 

[12:57] <tormentedmayhem 17> Lol Phil plays mutiplayer shooters like single player games. It’s hard to watch 
sometimes. 

[12:57] <imaidenr> hey Phil 
[12:57] <encelor> much rage 

[12:57] <bionich00t> @blue_blur64 I see. Mine would be in order Lost World, Adventure 1 and Heroes. 

[12:57] <bionich00t> So opposite opinions here. 

[12:57] <blue_blur64> Heroes would be 4th for me 
[12:58] <bionich00t> Forces almost if not last 
[12:58] <blue_blur64> Not even close Bionic brownLUL 
[12:58] <ryuhayabusa400> Play Splinter cell trilogy 
[12:58] <bionich00t> Boom is worse but... not much else 
[12:58] <trihard41iife> TriHard 
[12:58] <bethemadeagle> dspHmm 
[12:58] <vendatus> WutFace 

[12:58] <blue_blur64> The fact that I've almost 100% Forces and the only other sonic game I've 100% is Heroes 
says something :P 

[12:58] <bethemadeagle> i gotta check something be right back 



[12:59] <bionichOOt> Forces 100% must be one of the easiest though right 
[12:59] <kinggoken> over 2000 viewers for that podcast 

[12:59] <blue_blur64> Eh, some of the time challenges were pretty strict, but besides that it's just a lot of 
grinding (specifically for rings) 

[12:59] <yasser_chill> I am new on Twitch (just made my accout) but i am watching Phill since 2008 :) 
[12:59] <bionich00t> At least it's not as bad as SA2's emblems 
[12:59] <vendatus> 5Y‘D □ 

[12:59] <arcticsurface> Welcome @Yasser_Chill 
[12:59] <trihard41iife> @yasser_chill same..welcome 

[13:00] <encelor> lacP Hi i am Chris Hanson from dateline ,please take a seat Hollywood 

[13:00] <bionich00t> Phil why not rent out your spare room and get an upfront payment? Just make a deal for 

1000s of $s for say, 6 months. 

[13:00] <yasser_chill> Thank you guys 

[13:00] <tormentedmayhem 17> Welcome to the stream team lol

[13:00] <yasser_chill> Thank you and wish you all a wonderful evening, greeting from Switzerland :) 

[13:01] <bionich00t> I never 100%’d either. SA2 sounds evil to 100%

[13:01] <blue_blur64> Now that Steam has PS4 controller support :P

[13:02] <bethemadeagle> why 

[13:02] <tormentedmayhem 17> Lol watching phil play Fortnite, i can't imagine what he’ll be like on PUBG. 

[13:02] <bionich00t> Phil rent out your room for an upfront payment. Get 1000s that way 

[13:03] <bethemadeagle> maybe next year

[13:32] <vendatus> AC4 > 2 LUL 

[13:32] <bionich00t> Worst genre 

[13:32] <majinboo3> Though looking at what these guys are wearing this must be Egypt after it was conquered 
by Alexander.

the "wow dood bullet" 

[13:32] <bethemadeagle> ven i say 2>4>origins sorry 

[13:32] <bionich00t> Did you guys know that Egyptian pharaohs were all black but whiteys censored them to be 
light skinned because they racist n shiet?

[13:34] <encelor> @majinboo3 when japan becomes proffesional victims of white sociaty 
[13:34] <tormentedmayhem 17> I don't phil has ever played AC1, has he? 

[13:34] <encelor> LUL 

[13:34] <bionich00t> Isn't it racist that black guy can jump and climb well like why can't he be smart and suave 
like a white guy? Stereotypical racism 
[13:34] <tormentedmayhem 17> think* 

[13:34] <majinboo3> he played AC1 off camera when it came out 
[13:34] <majinboo3> but not on youtube 
[13:34] <bionich00t> AC1 was so awful tho 
[13:34] <bionich00t> Legit 3/10 
[13:35] <vendatus> nah 

[13:35] <blue_blur64> First game in franchise problems bionic :P 

[13:35] <bionich00t> yah 

[13:35] <tormentedmayhem 17> Ahhh okay. 

[13:35] <bethemadeagle> bionic i think bayek is very smart but made stupid decisions and you know assassins 
can climb well lol 

[13:35] <bionich00t> that is true @blue_blur64 

[13:35] <encelor> people iwth white guilt are just racist fucks who feel guilt LUL 
[13:35] <skooma_dealer> Im sterile, im so glad i cannot impregnate Encelor now 



[13:35] <doctormaul> I found every flag in acl. I never want to play it again. Lol 
[13:35] <skooma_dealer> now we can raw dog it all night 

[13:35] <djrunol> crysis is one of the few game franchises i know that got worse every game 
[13:35] <divanerasmus> hello @everyone Hi @DarksydePhil 
[13:35] <blue_blur64> is that a separate ability Phil? 

[13:35] <bionich00t> True, he’s just like the other assassins but considering blacks were kings in the Egyptian 
period he should be smarter too. Mozart and Shakespeare are black too don't listen to white historian lies. 

[13:36] <skooma_dealer> OY VEY 

[13:36] <tormentedmayhem 17> AC1 was decent, but 2 improved on everything wrong with the first. 

[13:36] <majinboo3> The craziest game i think to 100 % is Baiten Kaitos You'll have to literally grind 100s of 
hours on bullshit 

[13:36] <sirnoblex> That's a skill you can get 

[13:36] <bionich00t> Baten Kaitos 100% is 350 hours lol 

[13:36] <bionich00t> I wish Phil would play Baten Kaitos great underrated gem 

[13:36] <encelor> why is it that cucks with white guilt see black people so slow that the white guilts have to 
defend them? 

[13:36] <skooma_dealer> quick poll chat: have you ever impregnated a woman? 

[13:36] <encelor> so low* 

[13:37] <doctormaul> @bionich00t I have that GameCube game. Ita€™s awesome 

[13:37] <bionich00t> because racism = power + IQ. White people have all the power and much higher IQ than 
blacks so they're racist. 

[13:37] <encelor> are they saying black people are not able to def them self? 

[13:37] <bionich00t> Baten Kaitos is the best JRPG on GCN easily. Never played the sequel but it seems good 
[13:37] <skooma_dealer> they have dex but no int LUL 

[13:37] <majinboo3> It sucks that Phil viewquit Tales of Symphonia he was just getting to the interesting part 
[13:37] <bethemadeagle> please dont hate on this game its new and to me its the best assassins creed since black 
flag and that was years and years ago 

[13:37] <pablofortunata> @Bionich00t reporting you for racist dogwhistling fyi 
[13:37] <majinboo3> Kaede? 

[13:37] <encelor> @Bionich00t exactly xD 

[13:37] <djrunol> wow. he unlocks the door and also unties them in the process 

[13:37] <bionich00t> Blacks got all the STR and AGI but no INT. Racist whites got all the INT. 

[13:37] <katexo234> poor bethe 

[13:37] <skooma_dealer> people hating shouldnt matter if you like Eagle :) 

[13:37] <chairmancaleb> Best Assassin’s Creed since Black Flag... 

[13:37] <chairmancaleb> Hmm.. 

[13:37] <blue_blur64> uh, you ok bionic? 

[13:38] <doctormaul> @bionich00t think a lot of people passed on it because of the cards. 

[13:38] <skooma_dealer> people hate TES but i love it 9im not todd i swear) 

[13:38] <bionich00t> @blue_blur64 What you mean? 

[13:38] <majinboo3> WE11 they are black 
[13:38] <infinite_sphere> black stamina TriHard 

[13:38] <tormentedmayhem 17> A lot of people consider this the best AC to date. 

[13:38] <octoa> OH BEE ESS 

[13:38] <bethemadeagle> i think bionic is going on a rant over whites 
[13:38] <skooma_dealer> phil are you wearing pants!

[13:38] <skooma_dealer> phil needs a new laptop 

[13:38] <bionich00t> Is it okay to say I found DSP's "most racist DSP comments" video really funny back in the 



day LUL 

[13:38] <feelandthink> dsp should play the ffxv die 

[13:38] <thedoctor5437> where the hell did he get that flaming sword? 

[13:39] <encelor> @blue_blur64 he was responding to what i said about why people with white guilt let not 
black people defend them self 

[13:39] <majinboo3> Next thing you know AC is gonna turn into a visual novel 

[13:39] <bethemadeagle> bionic i wasnt really complaining i was just saying but yeah people could get offended 
though 

[13:39] <skooma_dealer> @encelor im tired of you ignoring me 

[13:39] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[13:39] <bionich00t> @BetheMadEagle Oh my bad. 

[13:39] <wjr02003> @darksydephil So Twitch Support just made a HUGE announcement that may require 
attention. We’re actively investigating an upstream payment processor issue which may cause long-running 
subscriptions (~3 years) via PayPal to abruptly cancel. May wanna keep an eye on subscriptions. 

[13:39] <bethemadeagle> its fine 

[13:39] <igoturcorona> @Bionich00t whats with all this race talk how about asian people? 

[13:39] <skooma_dealer> this guy looks a bit ghey 

[13:39] <encelor> @blue_blur64 and that people with white guilt threat black people like they are incapable to 
defend them self 

[13:39] <bionich00t> It must be stated though: Pharoahs were BLack, not white or light skinned. Pharoahs and 
Mozart and Shakespeare were BLACK brothers. Don't believe the white wash 
[13:39] <encelor> asian people are doing great 

[13:39] <doctormaul> Acl was fucked ip not making him swim. A bad ass Assassin cana€™t even dog paddle to 
safety 

[13:40] <encelor> more priviledged than white most of the time 
[13:40] <bethemadeagle> no one here is subbed for 3 plus hours 
[13:40] <bethemadeagle> years

[13:40] <tormentedmayhem 17> Telltale games presents : Assassins Creed. Kappa 

[13:40] <bethemadeagle> no 

[13:40] <bionich00t> Abraham Lincoln I heard on Facebook was black too. Racists whitewashed him but I don't 
know if I believe that one 

[13:41] <reefmaster_> Does anyone know wea€™re you can get that shield 
[13:41] <bethemadeagle> bionic you believe what you believe just like everyone else 

[13:41] <encelor> for that time its normal you cannot bring this day and ages progression and moral to the apst 
[13:41] <encelor> past* 

[13:41] <doctormaul> @bionich00t you need to stop getting your history from Facebook dude. 

[13:41] <encelor> its just not logical 

[13:41] <bionich00t> @BetheMadEagle You've got to admit that whitewashing Black figures like Mozart and 
Napoleon is a bit fucked up. 

[13:42] <wxrxaxtxh> >.> 

[13:42] <infinite_sphere> FailFish 

[13:42] <bethemadeagle> if they were black that is the first i heard of that bionic 

[13:42] <blue_blur64> Ok, I'm getting some food and then probably playing some Valkyria Chronicles 

Remastered :P 

[13:42] <bionich00t> Yes they were proven by the Black Israelites to be black. But I'm not 100% sure it’d make 
sense though. Lincoln may have been black too. 

[13:42] <majinboo3> The only good roman is a dead roman 

[13:42] <bionich00t> Phil should really play Valkyria Chronicles a classic. 

[13:42] <bethemadeagle> and if facebook said so then it probably isnt true 
[13:42] <majinboo3> All weeb games have been banned by phil 



[13:42] <blue_blur64> And with VC 4 coming out next year Bionic 

[13:42] <infinite_sphere> so all the depictions/ paintings of mozart showing him as a white man is all lie then?? 
FailFish 

[13:43] <majinboo3> atleast for the time being 

[13:43] <doctormaul> @blue_blur64 I heard they are making a new one Cana€™t wait for it 

[13:43] <bethemadeagle> bionic i never heard of those people 

[13:43] <blue_blur64> next year doctor, on PS4, Switch, and Xbox One 

[13:43] <bionich00t> Black Lives Matter showed tons of evidence of Mozart being black. You can hear the 
jungle rhythms in his music. It sounds like African folk music. 

[13:43] <bethemadeagle> who know what stuff people make up 
[13:43] <majinboo3> LOL michael jordan is a relative of bayak 
[13:43] <wxrxaxtxh> lol 

[13:43] <infinite_sphere> EleGiggle blacklivesmatter is a fucking JOKE mate. 

[13:43] <encelor> mozart black ? 

[13:43] <encelor> LUL 

[13:44] <bionich00t> Mozart WAS black I am sure of that. BLM made a fool proof case for it

[13:44] <encelor> BLM is full of shit 

[13:44] <infinite_sphere> next thing you wanna tell me hitler was black EleGiggle 
[13:44] <bionich00t> Hitler wasn't black but may have been jewish 

[13:44] <bethemadeagle> bionic do you believe everything you read or hear i mean some people or groups talk a 
load of crap about anything sorry to say 

[13:44] <doctormaul> Oh my god. Did Mozart have a boom box? So he wasna€™t black 

[13:44] <infinite_sphere> FailFish 

[13:45] <tormentedmayhem 17> This chat rn. 

[13:45] <kushiyakitori> bethe do you think he is being serious? lol 

[13:45] <bionich00t> @BetheMadEagle I hope not. BLACK MOZART is a strong theory though if you look it 
up 

[13:45] <bethemadeagle> everyone has a theory 
[13:45] <bethemadeagle> who knows what is true 

[13:45] <infinite_sphere> This shows me how fucked up BLM really is LMAO 

[13:45] <majinboo3> I can attest Mozard is indeed black I've seen him with my own 2 eyes 

[13:45] <wxrxaxtxh> how old is Phil 

[13:45] <bionich00t> BLM has a lot of black historians AKA thuganomic professors who have proven that 
Mozart was black. And possibly Jesus too 

[13:45] <encelor> BLM alsosays that in 1300 was a black king that was so modern and rich yet africans stayed 

like tribes with tribalistic lives

[13:46] <majinboo3> Well, the thing BLM dont want you to know is that Donald Trump is indeed BLACK 
[13:46] <bionich00t> Yeah I can't back up Jesus being black I think BLM is wrong on tht. 

[13:46] <bionich00t> sorry. But Mozart may well have been a Black brother. 

[13:46] <doctormaul> Omg lets talk about relevant stuff please not bhn

[13:54] <bethemadeagle> people in this chat talk about all kinds of shit its either get used to it or ignore 
everything 

[13:54] <bionich00t> His video on that cam whore was funny tho 
[13:54] <korewasugoi> "thot" 

[13:55] <philandchill> I don’t believe in god because a god wouldn’t know if he actually knows everything, there 
could be something outside his knowledge, plus there's no proof of god, AND there's no reason to believe in god, 
if he's good then you don’t need blind belief to be on good terms, and you can keep making points its a dead 
subject 

[13:55] <korewasugoi> destroyed 

[13:55] <encelor> you are nothing but a hater drone - LTG 
[13:55] <encelor> lacR 
[13:55] <encelor> he woke LUL 

[13:55] <bionich00t> 1) there's tons of proof of God just LOOK AROUND YOU stoner! 2) no reason to believe 
in God? read the bible! 3) "blind belief' that's called faith bro OpieOP 



[13:55] <barantos> LTG is a cuck 
[13:55] <encelor> LTG has angel DNA 
[13:55] <encelor> never forgetti 

[13:55] <korewasugoi> "you are nothing but a thot, pleasing the virgin beta males on twitter" -LTG 
[13:55] <bethemadeagle> phil and chill i say you watch phil and chill i dont want to argue 
[13:56] <bethemadeagle> gosh darn it 

[13:56] <bethemadeagle> pis bionic and phil and chill dont argue pis 
[13:56] <katexo234> he was standing in the fire and die until Phil kill him LUL LUL LUL 
[13:56] <bionich00t> Okay, like I didn’t want to argue Jesus is Black, I'll back off on Christianity too 
[13:56] <bethemadeagle> kate phil did a mercy kill 

[13:57] <encelor> stop dissing LTG he has angel DNA he is the chosen nibba lacR 

[13:57] <philandchill> look around you? I don’t see god around me. if god exists is good then there’s no reason to 

believe in him on blind faith, however i don't think there could be a good god because there's way too much 

suffering, and eternal helfire, that's simply evil, humans are more moral then the Bible 

[13:57] <korewasugoi> LTG has angel dna, remember that 

[13:57] <philandchill> anyway, you should read some books 

[13:57] <tormentedmayhem 17> In other news, phil's weapon is pretty op lol 

[13:57] <kushiyakitori> essay posts lol 

[13:57] <bionich00t> I read many books man. 

[13:57] <bionich00t> Especially the bible and the torah 
[13:57] <bethemadeagle> just calm down and be friends :D 
[13:57] <bionich00t> Okay, what's going on with Islam btw? 

[13:57] <philandchill> great. I'm done talking about it, religion shouldn’t be a subject here, unless you seriosuly 
want to debate it with me 

[13:58] <philandchill> all your arguments will fail 
[13:58] <bionich00t> that'll be an eternity in hell plus tip 
[13:58] <korewasugoi> religion bois 

[13:58] <barantos> I would love to meet LTG in real life, and then burn lk in front of him, kick the fuck out of 
him, and throw a load in the girl pretending to date him 

[13:58] <blue_blur64> Yeah, what the fuck was happening here while I left for some nuggets? DansGame 

[13:58] <korewasugoi> @Barantos try kicking him 

[13:58] <skooma_dealer> gods not dead hes like a lion 

[13:58] <encelor> @blue_blur64 Aliens

[13:58] <katexo234> the chat went off the rails @blue_blur64 LUL 

[13:58] <bethemadeagle> well religion started silent and im trying to calm it nicely 

[13:58] <barantos> I would be happy to fuck up LTG 

[13:58] <bionich00t> LTG would win a fight against any of you pasty tacist whites 
[13:58] <tormentedmayhem 17> Religion happened lol, let's change the subject. 

[13:58] <blue_blur64> nappyYikes 

[13:58] <chairmancaleb> @Bionich00t Lol, I was thinking the same thing. 

[13:58] <korewasugoi> LTG is the god on the internet 
[13:58] <bethemadeagle> lyg was brought up 

[13:58] <barantos> one kick to those chicken legs and he would be in a wheelchair for life 
[13:59] <encelor> @Barantos only advantage you'll have is his chicken legs being weak 
[13:59] <encelor> LUL 

[13:59] <skooma_dealer> @Bionich00t OY VEY 
[13:59] <bethemadeagle> ltg* 

[13:59] <chairmancaleb> Guy might not be very likeable, but I doubt many people could legitiamtely beat him 
up. 



[13:59] <barantos> he doesn't lift that much either 
[13:59] <chairmancaleb> Here at least. 

[13:59] <optionalsuperboss> KoreWaSugoi hes low tier tho :thinking: 

[13:59] <chairmancaleb> Not in the entire world. 

[13:59] <karlis_k> Off the rails? Better bring it back with Ruby then ... 

[13:59] <bethemadeagle> i bet he is getting a compass 

[13:59] <bionich00t> LTG believes that Jesus was black too, he talked about it on stream. He also agrees with 

BLM on Mozart being black and Abraham Lincoln being a nA-gga, You got to admit if LTG and BLM agree on 

something it's likely to be true 

[13:59] <skooma_dealer> what a lovely languadge 

[13:59] <korewasugoi> @Barantos i can bet, Ltg can lift more than yolu 

[13:59] <skooma_dealer> hmmmm 

[13:59] <korewasugoi> you* 

[13:59] <blue_blur64> Rwby @Karlis_K ? Sure, it's a great series brownJOKES 

[13:59] <skooma_dealer> i love the throat clearing 

[13:59] <barantos> I bet he can't 

[14:00] <encelor> LTG thinks he has angel DNA 

[14:00] <barantos> ltg works out on machines like a bitch, and eats welfare food 
[14:00] <encelor> Keepo 
[14:00] <korewasugoi> he does 

[14:00] <blue_blur64> But seriously guys, can we just get off this topic? 

[14:00] <encelor> makes you wonder 

[14:00] <tormentedmayhem 17> A lot of People put Bayek up there with Ezio, any thoughts? 

[14:00] <skooma_dealer> lets speak in yiddish 

[14:00] <bionich00t> LTG uses free weights I never saw him use machines 

[14:00] <chairmancaleb> A No 

[14:00] <chairmancaleb> Absolutely not, Tormented. 

[14:00] <bionich00t> What did Phil lift? 

[14:00] <bethemadeagle> we got religion, whether or not historic figures were black or white and ltg talk i am a 
tad uncomfortable 

[14:00] <bionich00t> Did Phil lift an elephant 

[14:00] <skooma_dealer> oy vey it was such a shunder i should never buy gribbonis from a moil its so chewy! 
[14:00] <korewasugoi> what else are sposed to talk about'? phils commentary? 

[14:00] <impstardestroyer> Bayek > Ezio 

[14:00] <barantos> I would be happy to get off the topic, ltg is a bitch I would be happy to say it to his fucking 
face 

[14:00] <voltagemax> i prefer ezio and edward 
[14:01] <korewasugoi> @Barantos go to his twitter 

[14:01] <hindae> LTG uses free weights because they remind him of himself 
[14:01] <impstardestroyer> Ezio is way overrated tbh 

[14:01] <blue_blur64> Anything else, I don’t really care. I'm not one for constant shitting on other people 
[14:01] <encelor> now i wanna see barantos fight LTG 

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> ezio is best assassins edward is second and bayek is third 

[14:01] <encelor> LUL 

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> as is the games 

[14:01] <barantos> he banned me, because I called him out 

[14:01] <bionich00t> @HinDae HAHAHA 

[14:01] <karlis_k> forget religion - all I wanna know if unicorns were real 

[14:01] <skooma_dealer> unicorns are very real 

[14:01] <karlis_k> Rhinos don't count 

[14:01] <encelor> every male is a unicorn when horny 

[14:01] <bionich00t> I think Trump has some black in him tbh 



[14:01] <korewasugoi> lets change topic, who here eats ass? 

[14:01] <skooma_dealer> unicorns are still real 

[14:01] <encelor> Keepo 

[14:01] <skooma_dealer> im horny rn 

[14:01] <octoa> frees it, then kills its ass 

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> whinos are real and they got horns 

[14:02] <bethemadeagle> rhinos* 

[14:02] <skooma_dealer> kek wineos 

[14:02] <bionich00t> All I need to see is Trump being loud in a movie theater to confirm he's a little black 
[14:02] <impstardestroyer> Best assassins: Altair > Bayek > Edward > Connor > Ezio > Arno 
[14:02] <tormentedmayhem 17> He's not a bad character imo, not as bad as Connor. Not to mention he started 
the Creed, Edward didn’t even care for the Creed. 

[14:02] <skooma_dealer> those are real too 

[14:02] <encelor> i heard there used to be 3 tittied humanoids back in the day but natural selection screwed them 
over 

[14:02] <encelor> such shame they dieded 

[14:02] <thedoctor5437> @BetheMadEagle wouldnt it be reasonable for bayek to be the best since he is one of 
the first assassins 

[14:02] <korewasugoi> hello my fellow african americans 
[14:03] <karlis_k> I propose we call rhinos "whinos" from now on 
[14:03] <encelor> @KoreWaSugoi hello my 30% white dude 

[14:03] <bionich00t> You know what's really surprising? They did a test recently and found white people have 
more in common in terms of DNA with chimpanzees than African Americans. 

[14:03] <karlis_k> someone get Oxford dictionary peoiple on the phone stat! 

[14:03] <bethemadeagle> ezio>edward>bayek>altair>jacob>evie>connor>arno 
[14:03] <karlis_k> *people 

[14:03] <tormentedmayhem 17> Bayek is definitely the most op. 

[14:03] <octoa> cheer20 I wonder if you could have just burned the cage and had a tasty Lion burger or 
something

[14:18] <bethemadeagle> ven hoi up he has read some of my comments and listened to me before 
[14:19] <philandchill> it's weird how more people watch Phil for his salt then his funny commentary (like 



hilarious impressions and making fun of characters,) I never payed much attention to the salt aspects just always 
crack up at his jokes and commentary 
[14:19] <vendatus> so Once a month LUL 

[14:19] <dukesdearfreja> @darksydephil it's those red jars you have to break 
[14:19] <tormentedmayhem 17> Lol figured that, he should try using them more often. 

[14:19] <bethemadeagle> why does today stream seem like second stream to me its nice and fun and chill and 

silent and pops are here 

[14:19] <bethemadeagle> its weird 

[14:19] <encelor> @PhilAndChill most people do that LUL 

[14:19] <blue_blur64> Because it's Black Friday, everybody's chilled out 

[14:19] <bethemadeagle> ven no phil dont have a period and that is why he listens to me

it's on sale. dspPepe dspPepe 

[14:20] <chairmancaleb> @PhilAndChill His rage can sometimes be funny, but I do find his commentary to be 
just as funny. 

[14:20] <blue_blur64> what's a streamdeck? 

[14:21] <encelor> @Popsicolo be selfish once a while 

[14:21] <philandchill> I guess I just hear a lot more about salt from people but it's actually not that entertaining 

to me lol. I'm just into his humor and personal experience with games 

[14:21] <encelor> threat your self 

[14:21] <divanerasmus> Fuck That Building 

[14:21] <encelor> sllverZaebis

just the right settings for it to be stable xD

his best moments: jokes and funny impressions of characters, and say "idk just find this really funny and enjoy 
Phil’s personal experience, not everyone has to like it, it's just subjective" 

[14:27] <wxrxaxtxh> has dsp played rockband 

[14:27] <chairmancaleb> It’s ironic that they even come to Phil’s streams to ask such a thing in the first place. 
Why is your obsession with some guy on the internet taking priority over your own life?

[14:31] <encelor> @DarksydePhil did you open your daily lootbox? 

[14:32] <philandchill> the Ancient camp of Sulu 

[14:32] <blue_blur64> Oh wow, I forgot this game had lootboxes. This could also get banned in Europe 
[14:32] <encelor> @blue_blur64 prolly only lootbox will be blocked 
[14:32] <encelor> if they ban it ofcourse 
[14:32] <bethemadeagle> silent better not 

[14:33] <blue_blur64> It means that games with lootboxes become adult only encelor, resulting in a lot less sales 
[14:33] <calo_nord_> nothing i could do 
[14:33] <popsicolo> Ibraziers 

[14:33] <waifudestroyermatt> he could trap them first 

[14:33] <encelor> @blue_blur64 it'll be just prolly cencored like australian games 
[14:33] <djrunol> you missed him with a million arrows 
[14:33] <ryuhayabusa400> Stealth phil lol 

[14:33] <encelor> where the lootbox option ingame are jsut not shown 
[14:34] <encelor> in the end kids always end up with adult games 
[14:34] <encelor> there is no real regulation for that 
[14:34] <katexo234> double cross 

[14:34] <philandchill> guards in cages... that's easily explainable 

[14:34] <philandchill> there were others in the cages with thim 

[14:34] <blue_blur64> Well Hawaii is also having a similar opinion to Belgium 

[14:35] <encelor> belgium didn’t happen was mistranslation 

[14:35] <popsicolo> It’s a glitch in the animus, Phil. 

[14:35] <encelor> australia and hawai banned 

[14:35] <popsicolo> "DICE, out lootboxes in your game. What could possibly go wrong? popsicSmug " -EA 
[14:35] <afarcryaway> Are all Ubisoft games taking place in the Animus? That would be their lore friendly way 
of getting away with so many bugs 

[14:36] <bethemadeagle> helps civilians but leaves them to get attacked and killed by any guards they need to 
run past 

[14:36] <kovorus> dood! 

[14:36] <blue_blur64> And there's that internet reset I talked about earlier :P 
[14:36] <encelor> why aren’t templars in this AC :P 
[14:36] <octoa> dat aim! 

[14:36] <encelor> i mean roman empire was in egypt 

[14:37] <bethemadeagle> the entire order of the snake is the TEMPLARS 

[14:37] <encelor> you would expect a couple of deus vults 

[14:37] <dukesdearfreja> @darksydephil fight all the Phylakees 

[14:37] <encelor> ah makes sense 

[14:37] <bethemadeagle> we just dont call them that 

[14:37] <chaosalltheway> i love this shield man 

[14:37] <bethemadeagle> they are just the order 

[14:37] <popsicolo> If you want a Deus Vult, spam emotes. 

[14:37] <djrunol> can you not use senu to look for the treasure?

[14:37] <afarcryaway> I was hoping they would take the For Honor combat system and integrate it into AC 
somehow when you're not in stealth mode 

[14:37] <aloofone> he doesn’t seem to be enjoying this game =( shame 

[14:38] <bethemadeagle> for honor sucks

the game for weeks aka no practice 

[14:38] <afarcryaway> I agree @encelor 

[14:39] <voltagemax> use senu if u can’t find the treasure 

[14:39] <afarcryaway> I love the idea of For Honor, hated the execution of it 

[14:39] <octoa> because Mount and Blade is so much better : A )
