Speed Payback at 7:30pm PST! 

[12:26] <i_spawn_i_die> yeah its series he did a little while ago theres been a ton of update and was wondering 

if he would return back to the game 

[12:29] <zaxbys_sauce> this is riveting 

[12:29] <darksydephil> wassap everybody 

[12:29] <zaxbys_sauce> hey phil 

[12:30] <zaxbys_sauce> have some bits cheerlO 

[12:30] <nich2440> hey phil 

[12:30] <nich2440> how close are we to the goal? 

[12:30] <aproxymate> man why r streaming in 360p 
[12:30] <moeneek_thethird> cheerlOO 

[12:31] <aproxymate> @MoeNEEK_TheThird are you Msmonique? 

[12:31] <darksydephil> its hard to tell because again, i dont know if everybody will clear or not. if everybody 
does, we will hit the goal. It looks like about $300 has cleared so far this month from people upping their 
pledges. So it needs about $950 to clear and we do have that pledged, but WILL it clear is the question? 

[12:32] <thenewfaceofcreation> wau dood

[12:32] <darksydephil> so when the stream goes live, you guys can start messing with the new Live Pet extension 
[12:32] <darksydephil> i think it becomes interactive when the stream starts 
[12:32] <kekon3> that's cool 



[12:33] <moeneek_thethird> @Aproxymate yes 

[12:33] <kekon3> last few days of school so trying to focus on that, but phil in the background doesn't hurt lol 
[12:33] <darksydephil> FYI i'm not getting paid for it, but if you spend money on it (i think there are 3 options?) 
i get a cut. But I'm not asking you to do that, i’m just curious it if even works because Kappa Pet didn’t

[14:01] <bethemadeagle> ven exactly look what you did 

[14:01] <infamousecondson> kill it with fire! literally 

[14:01] <richie7acr> the bear looks awesome, I like how he stands on 2 legs 

[14:01] <dukaduka> story-wise, does this mean the humans created giant bears or did the AI do it? 

[14:01] <dooley258> That thing looks awesome 

[14:02] <bethemadeagle> this is why there was no bear machines in the original they saved it for this 
[14:02] <dukaduka> Smokey Bear no :( 

[14:02] <bernielomax517> Nice moves FutureMan 
[14:02] <vendatus> no deaths dspPepe 
[14:02] <bethemadeagle> yep phil

[14:02] <thenewfaceofcreation> i thought there was going to be a salty strea, 

[14:02] <pwnage_101> Cool. He beat it on the first try. 

[14:02] <thenewfaceofcreation> dammit 
[14:02] <bethemadeagle> bear im disappointed in your cousin 
[14:03] <bethemadeagle> hopefully the next one wont be as easy

[14:04] <vendatus> so bear he's straight Kappa 
[14:04] <bammbino> this music.. Kreygasm 

[14:04] <theycallmejimbob> I think he said the 5th of Dec to the 11th grsicki not too sure 

[14:04] <bethemadeagle> jim later phil has to fight 2 at once with a tower which heals them and need to take out 

first 

[14:04] <thatanonybear> basically Ven :P 

[14:04] <richie7acr> how many new robots are there? 

[14:04] <grsicki> @theycallmejimbob oh okay thank you jimbob 
[14:05] <bammbino> SourPls 

[14:05] <skumbag_horse> thinking of starting to support you, can you explain how patreon and subscribing will 
work when you change the perks? I dont know which one i should go with to support you 
[14:05] <bethemadeagle> jim i knew that bear would show up and i knew he would be fighting a few of them 
before i made the bet and yes I PLAYED YOU 
[14:05] <vendatus> Wakanda Forever ohhh wait LUL 

[14:05] <theycallmejimbob> BetheMadEagle hopefully that wont happen during this stream NotLikeThis 
[14:05] <theycallmejimbob> dspAngrydsp I thought you liked eating humble pie 

[14:06] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse he’d prefer people to just sub here for now so he can grow his channel 




[14:06] <fluttershyl970> edward snowden put up that satellite 
[14:06] <thenewfaceofcreation> @skumbag_horse ask the streamer 

[14:06] <bethemadeagle> jim its going to happen one way or another, technically he didnt even need to fight the 
first bear that is a optional fight 

[14:06] <skumbag_horse> so i should ignore patreon then? 

[14:06] <theycallmejimbob> why didn’t you tell him that BetheMadEagle SwiftRage 
[14:06] <bentboxer> when are they going to have a nude mod for this game? 

[14:06] <thenewfaceofcreation> @skumbag_horse yes 
[14:06] <vendatus> WutFace 
[14:07] <thatanonybear> fair moans :D 
[14:07] <bernielomax517> LUL 

[14:07] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse He isn’t going to ignore patreon, its just going to take a little bit of a 

back seat JUST to see what he can make of twitch 

[14:07] <markymark52> I was just going to cheer that. That’s funny 

[14:07] <bentboxer> matt lauer too sigh 

[14:07] <bethemadeagle> jim i had to eat one yesterday so i thought i would try and cheat by making you go 10 
again today 

[14:07] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse if you can only support from one or the other, he’ll want you to sub here 
[14:07] <bentboxer> matt lauer charlie rose bill o'reilly... where am i going to get my news from 
[14:07] <dukaduka> every male in power gonna get fired WutFace 

[14:07] <pwnage_101> I'm watching this here in front of my Mom. I hope she doesn't tell me to stop watching 
lol. 

[14:07] <theycallmejimbob> you could still lose BetheMadEagle dspHmm he seems to have got the hang of this 
game 

[14:08] <thenewfaceofcreation> @skumbag_horse or just keep your moeny. its your choice tho :p 
[14:08] <bentboxer> charlie rose i was irritated about i loved his show 
[14:08] <skumbag_horse> define backseat, doesnt sound good lol 
[14:08] <thenewfaceofcreation> where is PJSalt PJSalt 
[14:08] <bernielomax517> Nodes on the floor PogChamp 

[14:08] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse Patreon has been front and center for his projects aka playthroughs, 
video shoutouts and more 

[14:08] <thenewfaceofcreation> @pwnage_101 how old are you my friend 
[14:09] <bentboxer> matt lauer had a wife and children wtf was he doing 
[14:09] <bethemadeagle> jim yeah but like people say this die will kick phils ASS 
[14:09] <pwnage_101> 33 

[14:09] <bentboxer> 33, the age of scarlett johansen 
[14:09] <bethemadeagle> that is how hard it will get for em 

[14:09] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse hes going to attempt to get more support here on twitch so the goals will 
be based on how many subs he gets., he may even do things WITH subs rather than doing things FOR patreons 
[14:09] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock BetheMadEagle this doesn’t bode well 
[14:09] <bentboxer> how is scarlet johanssen only 33 
[14:09] <bentboxer> she's been around for 2 decades 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> jim he is only on the second mission of 5 main missions of the die this is still early 

[14:10] <breath321> @Bammbino He should probably start lettign the patreons get what they want, instead of 

letting them choose a game out of a list that Phil wants to play 

[14:10] <skumbag_horse> seems kinda shit for patrons but thanks for clearing it up 

[14:10] <theycallmejimbob> have you beaten this already BetheMadEagle 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> jim yeah 

[14:10] <grsicki> LUL 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> it was fun and difficult 

[14:10] <richie7acr> @skumbag_horse Phil has many ways to support him, pick whatever makes sense for you. 
For example, I rarely get to watch live streams because of my work schedule, so I do Patreon 



[14:10] * thenewfaceofcreation does online combos to phil and he loses 

[14:11] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse patreon wasnt made just for patrons to get a return pr a favor.. ACG 
reviews and many others have patreon just for support and you get nothing in return 
[14:11] <theycallmejimbob> remember when Cherdy did a stream of Enslaved Odyssey to the West 
BetheMadEagle dspPepe 

[14:11] <bethemadeagle> i did most of the side missions as well 
[14:11] <bethemadeagle> jim i member that was the could ol days 
[14:11] <fluttershyl970> enslaved was a good game back in the day 
[14:11] <bethemadeagle> good* 

[14:12] <dukaduka> @Bammbino sadly, that's what patreon has turned into 

[14:12] <azotherian> hey, does anyone want a free PC game? Humble Bundle is giving The Bureau: Xcom 
Declassified for free! 

[14:12] <bammbino> @dukaduka well it was meant for that tho, they just allowed you to add milestones etc 
[14:12] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm you didn't 100% it BetheMadEagle what's next on the agenda 
[14:12] <bethemadeagle> enslaved needs a new game man 

[14:12] <skumbag_horse> well i mean, without perks theres less incentive for patrons and for current ones its 
kinda shit. But hey, if thats what he wants to do, so be it 

[14:12] <bammbino> @dukaduka lets face it, it has got to suck to need to cater to each and every individual 
patron 

[14:12] <bammbino> @dukaduka i sure wouldnt do it 

[14:13] <azotherian> so, is DSP still going to do his holiday marathon? 

[14:13] <bethemadeagle> jim i still got the gtas i bought and mgs 5 
[14:13] <pwnage_101> @azotherian Most likely, yes. 

[14:13] <azotherian> @pwnage_101 but he is under the goal amount 

[14:13] <dukaduka> @Bammbino well it just seems like a personal charity farm where everyone is trying to 
squeeze a few dollars out of anyone they can 

[14:13] <theycallmejimbob> that'll take you a while BetheMadEagle :D I got 50 hours out of San Andreas a 

couple of months ago 

[14:13] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[14:14] <paddingtonbearl87> mskkWTF 

[14:14] <bammbino> @skumbag_horse heres the thing., he TRIED to use patron as a way to get people involved 
in his forums, they can all vote and nominate things., the sad part of it is that not even 10% of the patrons 
contributed to his community forums and what not other than requesting he make a video for them as private 
[14:14] <pwnage_101> @azotherian Well Phil said that as long as everyone's pledges clear, the marathon will 
happen. 

[14:14] <bethemadeagle> well you do go from los santos to the countryside to san francisco to the desert to las 

vegas and back to los santos 

[14:14] <paddingtonbearl87> fucking paragraph 

[14:14] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[14:14] <paddingtonbearl87> literally an essay CrreamAwk 
[14:14] <bammbino> @paddingtonBEAR187 dont read it, he asked for help 
[14:15] <bethemadeagle> she is the main shaman if you guys never knew

[14:21] <bammbino> these banuks... FailFish 



[14:21] <bethemadeagle> no NO its so not simple 
[14:21] <kittyspank> simple for ben affleck 

[14:21] <bentboxer> this summer... matt damon will shrink his world along with himself... 

[14:21] <britz94xd> Demon? Games saying that you need to play Demon souls dood 
[14:21] <tomahawkings> Thats one stupid helmet 
[14:21] <theycallmejimbob> mailer daemon dspHmm

like? 

[14:21] <bentboxer> how you like them apples sok 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> jim yeah 

[14:22] <skumbag_horse> mailer daemon what are you for real? lol 
[14:22] <pinkdam> or maybe it's a demon in the system like evilspeak 
[14:22] <paddingtonbearl87> dummies mskkWTF 

[14:22] <darkone667> daemon simply means a programme running in bacground 

[14:22] <dukaduka> i thought daemon was just one of the AIs that went rogue because someone programmed it 
to 

[14:22] <bethemadeagle> phil isnt wrong about that happening but is that theory the correct one for this game 
[14:22] <mk4eva> wasn’t Matt Damon last film was about that Donal Trump Wall? 

[14:22] <kittyspank> is this zion 
[14:22] <mk4eva> Kappa

[14:27] <mk4eva> why do i get the felling Sony will turn this game into a theater movie, with God of War 

movie, Uncharted in the works and the sly cooper movie coming next year 

[14:27] <dukaduka> @tomahawkings same I feel it's idea is wasted on very poor story telling

its power 

[14:39] <ornightz> Pfft LUL

[14:41] <infamousecondson> @pwnage_101 bye 

[14:42] <marshmelons> i dont think pc will be powerful enough to handle death stranding, i dont want the game 

to get held back so pirates and hackers can play it 

[14:42] <theycallmejimbob> oh no not another console war NotLikeThis 

[14:42] <pinkdam> only the xbox one x's uncompressed pixel technology can handle death stranding 
[14:42] <imaidenr> @marshmelons you must be trolling 

[14:42] <ornightz> I had mostly Superman figures growin Up and a Off the Line Custom Robo , I don’t know 
what brand are they from but they always had brief cases and meter connection joints , I had a blue model a 
Green model and a Red Model

[14:43] <ornightz> Metal* 

[14:43] <bammbino> —The studio also announced that it would be developing a new franchise, the first title of

[14:43] <bammbino> Death stranding wont make it to pc 

[14:43] <vendatus> It's Munster Huntar Kappa 

[14:43] <zukyun> exclusive like nioh? 

[14:43] <pinkdam> console exclusive to ps4 = pc release later 

[14:43] <theycallmejimbob> what's the death count up to BetheMadEagle dspHmm 

[14:44] <bethemadeagle> 3 jim 

[14:44] <thefalloutdude> hey phil im your number one fan, i love your paul sheldon books 
[14:44] <vendatus> might be 4 soon LUL 

[14:44] <bammbino> Nioh is locked to PS4 for consoles but koei tecmo owns the full rights and sony only got 
exclusivity 

[14:44] <mk4eva> still waiting for that SC 6 announcement NotLikeThis 
[14:44] <dukaduka> the gun does stacked damage on consecutive hits right? 

[14:45] <ornightz> No one ever heard oif these custom Robos huh , I think they were special forces cause their 
briefcases had assorted Weapons 

[14:45] <theycallmejimbob> slow and steady Phil SwiftRage 
[14:45] <chomchamp> yo phil 

[14:45] <bammbino> its looking like sony will own the full rights to death stranding since Sony invested in 
kojima productions(not owned by sony) 

[14:45] <theycallmejimbob> Gun doesn't seem to be too bad dspHmm 
[14:45] <dukaduka> @Mk4Eva watch it look worse than mvci LUL

[14:46] <bammbino> @Breath321 we all blame konami for that 

[14:46] <bammbino> they fucked him over and he STILL isnt allowed to say what konami did., wtf 
[14:46] <vendatus> MGSV was rushed 

[14:46] <djrunol> today they had to remove one of my wisdom teeth, now i have -10 wisdom stat:( 

[14:46] <breath321> Idk I just don't trust Kojimas writing anymore after MGSV, we’ll see if he redeems himself 
in death stranding though 

[14:47] <bammbino> @DJRunol i wish you a speedy recovering! i only had 1 taken out and i was in pain for 
2weeks 

[14:47] <chomchamp> awww @djrunol 

[14:47] <bammbino> @Breath321 did you play FF15 or have any insight into its fiasco? 

[14:47] <dukaduka> @Breath321 i'm somewhat worried, but what's the worst he can do with a new IP? 

[14:47] <marshmelons> kojima is the only person that made me feel ashamed of my words and deeds

[14:51] <bammbino> @Breath321 the same shit went down, Kojima needed alot more time and Konami refused 
it, fired him early, rushed the game so they can invest alltheir funds into pachinko machines 
[14:51] <dukaduka> that's why the second half of MGS5 was so empty... 

[14:51] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[14:51] <breath321> @Bammbino Yeah I knew about that, fuck Konami man 
[14:51] <bethemadeagle> everybody fuck now 

[14:51] <bammbino> @Breath321 idk who was in charge after the earlier temination of kojima, but he couldnt 
fix or finish the game

[15:25] <markymark52> I posted a reply in the thread. The guy could have just ran into him by pure chance. 

[15:25] <kozatof> The mystery at the mall 

[15:25] <kozatof> Phil should play that game 

[15:25] <monkeydonkeyape> so dramatic 

[15:25] <6th_moral> Are there any men in this game? 

[15:25] <bammbino> she — should be dead 

[15:25] <monkeydonkeyape> @6th_Moral seems like a chickflick 

[15:25] <eldeadmariachi> Lesbo the game 

[15:26] <suckasurprise> One of Phil's fans met him at the mall? 

[15:26] <kozatof> Yeah 

[15:26] <bethemadeagle> yes men are in this game 

[15:26] <monkeydonkeyape> well that one chick has manface 

[15:26] <kozatof> @darksydephil have you ever played mystery at the mall game 

[15:26] <dukaduka> well f u too then DansGame

[15:27] <kozatof> Oh so that was Leanna?

[15:27] <kozatof> She had long hair 

[15:27] <dukaduka> of course men are in the game LUL 

[15:28] <bethemadeagle> yes leanna did have long hair at one point 

[15:28] <monkeydonkeyape> do women like this exist? 

[15:28] <bethemadeagle> yes 

[15:28] <kozatof> Why do people assume thata€™s stalking @darksydephil 

[15:28] <monkeydonkeyape> can't imagine them going out in the snow alone to fight wild beasts and shit 
[15:28] <glorytobeh> nope 

[15:29] <bethemadeagle> kozatof people shouldnt be snapping pics of phil from behind 
[15:29] <kozatof> Yeah but what if they were already in that mall before phil 
[15:29] <bethemadeagle> still shouldnt be taking photos of him 

[15:29] <kushiyakitori> what happened? i was away a while, why is stream chat about malls? 



[15:29] <deepdrive3254> phil has a stalker now posting pics of him?

[15:30] <darksydephil> people know my address and what mall i live near, someone might take a pic of me if 
they recognize me. how is this a big deal 
[15:30] <kozatof> Exactly 

[15:30] <ragegamingl24> yes they have robot dinosaurs and they use bows and arrows 5Y~,6Y~, 

[15:30] <bethemadeagle> because it was of you and a girl phil 
[15:30] <bethemadeagle> and everyone says it was your new girlfriend 

[15:30] <6th_moral> when you have to sell your house they wont know your new address so there wont be 
anything to worry about 

[15:31] <markymark52> I posted that as well in the thread. Doesn’t mean the person is a stalker. 

[15:31] <bethemadeagle> but it is a older pic of you ad leanna

[15:34] <kushiyakitori> *to 60 

[15:35] <bethemadeagle> was about to say 

[15:35] <kushiyakitori> IDK if this is the challenge he is supposed to be doing 
[15:36] <kushiyakitori> And I feel that Phil can’t pass this challenge by her 
[15:36] <shoshone> yet another bugged game! 

[15:36] <bethemadeagle> no this is a side challenge and phil will prob die 
[15:36] <bethemadeagle> per usual

[15:47] <kushiyakitori> is he going to play through this whole DLC? it seems viewers don't care for it too much 
and like he feels ambivalent about it. 

[15:47] <goldencolts> the number has to be right next to the words

[15:51] <kushiyakitori> all old ladies look like old men 

[15:51] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil open the menu and go to the machine's info section so you can get a quick 
idea on who is weak to what for the sake of making the game easier for you 
[15:51] <kushiyakitori> and vice versa 

[15:51] <vendatus> gotta comeback 2nd stream for races Kappa 

[15:52] <kozatof> Is he dropping nfs

[16:04] <kozatof> I can finally hear 

[16:04] <gamemaster2003isdead> phil do you want to buy a mogwai only $20 
[16:04] <vendatus> bethe cause it based in Murica LUL 

[16:04] <stinkinburrows> what is this pet thing? i click on it and nothing happens 
[16:05] <bethemadeagle> i know ven LUL 

[16:05] <goldencolts> im gettin real tired of this 4Head i want the pet to evolve into a Blastoise or something 
[16:05] <bethemadeagle> the pet thing is there for you to just click on 
[16:05] <stinkinburrows> yea but nothing happens 
[16:05] <vendatus> it's like clicker heroes Kappa 

[16:06] <kushiyakitori> did he disable that other game extension in favor of this clicking one? 

[16:06] <bethemadeagle> true 

[16:06] <infamousecondson> how much longer would you say this DLC is? 

[16:06] <vendatus> more like twitch did 
[16:06] <kushiyakitori> maybe like 4 hours? 

[16:06] <glorytobeh> thats right 

[16:06] <glorytobeh> kill the evil white male 

[16:06] <kushiyakitori> twitch removed it? didn’t even notice 

[16:07] <bammbino> Aratek and Burgrend sound like voice actors from Xcom-2 

[16:07] <vendatus> I don't even think phil is halfway yet idk 

[16:08] <kushiyakitori> i think after this mission he just has to go to the dungeon and work his way through. 

unless he wants to do more side stuff 

[16:08] <vendatus> Bethe how long till the die is done? 

[16:09] <bethemadeagle> i think this is the 3rd mission and there are 5 so he is about half way done 

[16:09] <bethemadeagle> it depends on what phil does how long it will be 

[16:10] <kushiyakitori> and the last two are back to back 

[16:10] <vendatus> only 5 missions? what is this Destiny LUL 

[16:10] <hoboxl0> this game is the embodiment of ResidentSleeper 

[16:10] <bethemadeagle> i say one maybe 2 more streams 

[16:10] <infinite_sphere> Kreygasm 

[16:10] <infamousecondson> pay to play lol 

[16:11] <kushiyakitori> @BetheMadEagle idk if it should take two. i think the extended one should be enough, 
unless he wants to do all the extra stuff 



[16:11] <bethemadeagle> ven the first one is getting into frozen wilds and the other 4 are the bulk of the die 
[16:11] <bethemadeagle> oh yeah i forgot its a extended stream so yeah maybe that could be enough 
[16:12] <infamousecondson> thanks for the answers about the DLC length :D 
[16:12] <chairmancaleb> Lok tar ogar! 

[16:12] <bethemadeagle> big gorilla fuck 

[16:12] <vendatus> shoulda been atleast half of the main story then again that's expansions LUL 
[16:13] <kushiyakitori> it does make sense 

[16:13] <bethemadeagle> thhis is a long ish mission since he already done so much and still has this to do 
[16:14] <dankwhistler> Love ya phil 

[16:14] <vendatus> 6 minutes to climb a mountain SeemsGood 

[16:15] <bethemadeagle> but then this is easy cause it gives you plenty of time 

[16:16] <bethemadeagle> these enemies are weak ones give phil harder enemies :D 

[16:16] <chairmancaleb> This music sort of makes me want to start headbanging all over the place like Ace 
Ventura when he's driving across the bumpy road in the jeep LUL 
[16:16] <vendatus> lvl 40 trophy dspPepe 

[16:16] <bethemadeagle> i got level 40 trophy but just playing the original game 

[16:17] <kushiyakitori> @BetheMadEagle i think most people probably would, the base game gives a ton of 
experience to easily level and get skill points 

[16:17] <vendatus> that was the 2nd movie right Caleb with Shikaka LUL 
[16:18] <bethemadeagle> big fat easy ish machines 
[16:18] <kushiyakitori> LMAO 
[16:18] <thatanonybear> is dsp winning? 

[16:18] <darkone667> loool

[16:18] <vendatus> is that 4 

[16:19] <bethemadeagle> that is 3 

[16:19] <bethemadeagle> 4 

[16:19] <kushiyakitori> the other machines were working together to kick your ass and they succeeded 
[16:19] <bethemadeagle> i think a watcher flashed you aand the others fucked you 
[16:19] <bethemadeagle> bear would like that 

[16:19] <kushiyakitori> you have long range weapons, make use of them before you get closer, slow time, place 
your shots 

[16:19] <goldencolts> mrdestructoidl50 

[16:20] <vendatus> I say kill the little fuckers first LUL 

[16:20] <bethemadeagle> thats 5 

[16:20] <darkone667> you wont get anywhere just dumbly tankinge verything 

[16:20] <bethemadeagle> ven yes kill the little fucks then they wont be annoying you when you deal with the big 
guns 

[16:20] <infinite_sphere> too hard BabyRage 

[16:20] <darkone667> isn't even hard mode, just use some tactic instead of trying to rush the game 
[16:20] <kushiyakitori> its not instant, your health was being lowered for like the previous 30 seconds, pay 
attention to the surrounding enemies and place your shots so you dont waste time 
[16:21] <vendatus> You got 9 minutes kill them all 

[16:21] <kushiyakitori> if you want to tank and just walk through then use "story" difficulty 
[16:21] <bethemadeagle> he was getting hit with ice breath i saw it 
[16:22] <thatanonybear> fuck this cheap ass boss 

[16:22] <bethemadeagle> i can tank enemies in this game but i pick and choose which ones to kill first 



[16:23] <infinite_sphere> There we go

[16:33] <gutty333> @Breath321 is heading in that area, I won’t lie skipping that Mario level really ruined the 
ending. The thank you and climbing the tower is not the same when you glitch to skip it 
[16:33] <suckasurprise> I love Costco, the hotdogs are godlike

lol

[16:35] <djrunol> and wtf is costco? 

[16:35] <kushiyakitori> its a store, wholesale store 
[16:35] <jannedaarcl35> Inagito 
[16:35] <nightbot> #HopeSeedPhil #NudeForNagito 
[16:35] <bentboxer> costco is a warehouse that sells stuff 

[16:35] <sethl89> @DJRunol it is a good sight to behold, however it is sad that it's uncommon :( 

[16:35] <sethl89> at least these days 

[16:36] <bentboxer> you need a membership to get it, its really high end 
[16:36] <markymark52> I thought Costco was everywhere. 

[16:36] <bethemadeagle> jump 

[16:36] <djrunol> the next wholesale store is pretty far away from where i live and for whatever reason only 
businesses are allowed to shop there :( 

[16:36] <sethl89> rip 

[16:36] <bentboxer> is the 4 seasons everywhere? 

[16:36] <bentboxer> there you go 

[16:36] <kushiyakitori> @DJRunol have you heard of BJs? 

[16:36] <markymark52> What state do you live in DJRunol? 

[16:37] <bentboxer> dj = euro probably 

[16:37] <djrunol> @KushiYakitori only the sexual kind of BJ 

[16:37] <djrunol> i live in austria 

[16:37] <markymark52> well that explains it then lol 

[16:37] <infinite_sphere> LUL 



[16:37] <bentboxer> costco KKona

[16:38] <bentboxer> costco is like 1 tier above walmart, barely 
[16:38] <goldencolts> no way 

[16:39] <bentboxer> but hot dogs are a dollar fifty and roitisserie chickens are 5 dollars 
[16:39] <bentboxer> so worth it! 

[16:39] <lvlpower> hello hello 

[16:39] <markymark52> Yep, costco is awesome. Their Supreme large Pizza is 10 bucks too and it's super good. 

[16:39] <djrunol> at ikea we have hot dogs for only a, -1 0,70. best deal ever 

[16:40] <bentboxer> ikea here aint got cheap food anymore 

[16:40] <concretecasket> Ikea food is very suspect 

[16:40] <markymark52> Didn’t know Ikea sold food lol 

[16:40] <djrunol> i guess not every ikea is the same 

[16:40] <suckasurprise> @DJRunol Costco is kind of the same way, they're also known for their cheap hotdogs 
that are super delicious 

[16:40] <bentboxer> ikea used to sell pretty good food for super cheap 
[16:41] <goldencolts> the Swedish meatballs Kreygasm 
[16:41] <lvlpower> actually you only can eat in Ikea 
[16:41] <thatanonybear> this game looks p nice tbh 

[16:41] <bentboxer> ikea is good for 2 things, cheap food and giant ball playpen 
[16:42] <goldencolts> its also nice if you need a chair or a table or something Kappa 
[16:42] <bentboxer> i just use a dinner folding table and laptop 
[16:42] <bentboxer> no need for ikea for that 
[16:43] <kushiyakitori> just ropecast them, override and leave
