[19:44] <nich2440> just lazy ones 

[19:44] <skooma_dealer> I play while watching movies and stuff 

[19:44] <thatanonyraccoon> Telltale fired most of their staff, that probably affected things 
[19:44] <nollieflipunderflip> Hhahah yeah 
[19:44] <skooma_dealer> oh shit 



[19:44] <skooma_dealer> i thought they were doing good 
[19:44] <blue_blur64> Just popping in quick.

[19:44] <popsicolo> *The laid off employees will remember that 

[19:44] <skooma_dealer> they fucked up with got n shit 

[19:44] <travisvincent> Anyone else watching this Vikings vs Packers game? 

[19:44] <nich2440> I think the reason is because they got a new CEO a few years ago 
[19:44] <pureo_nikku> yeah and I need thielen to do something for fantasy 
[19:44] <stratmanl909> when is the 4th episode of lis out? 

[19:44] <skooma_dealer> @Kinggoken Tekken 
[19:44] <nich2440> but he stepped down last year 

[19:44] <thatanonyraccoon> they still have games coming out, but don't expect much from them 

[19:44] <skooma_dealer> Kappa 

[19:45] <nollieflipunderflip> @Kinggoken tekken 

[19:45] <blue_blur64> I was able to finally change my payment info for subs after looking up how to do it 
[19:45] <dspnumbalfandood> Dsp whata€™s your thoughts on TLJ ? 

[19:45] <0megaj0ker> Sup guys 

[19:45] <blue_blur64> @StratManl909 There is no 4th episode 
[19:45] <darksydephil> Game of Thrones was fucking terrible 
[19:45] <darksydephil> that game was literally theft 
[19:45] <nollieflipunderflip> :puke: 

[19:45] <lolligagg> no more vikings for me 
[19:45] <kinggoken> yeah Tekken is pretty awesome 
[19:45] <skooma_dealer> GOT was shit 
[19:45] <skooma_dealer> i got swindled 

[19:45] <blk_mage_ctype> TellTale probably spent way too much money on the licensing rights for so many 
series yet weren't turning enough of a profit. 

[19:45] <mxavier91> The problem with TellTale games are that they started to just shit the games out are not 

take their time to making them great 

[19:45] <lolligagg> im done w thevikings 

[19:45] <kinggoken> and yeah Game of thrones was horrible 

[19:45] <skooma_dealer> I got my money back from steam roll 

[19:45] <popsicolo> Good thing I didn’t buy the whole season then 

[19:45] <nich2440> easily their worst game 

[19:45] <travisvincent> I haven't watched the show yet 

[19:45] <stratmanl909> @blue_blur64 there is 

[19:45] <pureo_nikku> come to eagles bandwagon before it crashes @LolliGagg 

[19:45] <glitch_crazed> The cool thing about GOT was that the intro from the show was in it 

[19:45] <nich2440> i wouldn’t call it theft tho 

[19:45] <jeffwadsworth> @Skooma_Dealer If you really think that, I feel sorry for you. 

[19:45] <stratmanl909> @blue_blur64 you play as max 
[19:46] <skooma_dealer> i love TWD from them tho 
[19:46] <blue_blur64> That's a different thing 
[19:46] <yothatstuff> wolf amoung us was great 
[19:46] <skooma_dealer> @Jeffwadsworth think wut 

[19:46] <kinggoken> i'm guessing there won't be a season 2 of Telltale Game of Thrones lmao 

[19:46] <travisvincent> Breaking Bad tho 

[19:46] <nich2440> TWD gets worse with each season 

[19:46] <skooma_dealer> oh yes wolf amoung us was good too 

[19:46] <glitch_crazed> @kinggoken no there will be 

[19:46] <skooma_dealer> i liked it 

[19:46] <mervins_ghost> PogChamp >sub 200 viewers 



[19:46] <kinggoken> oh 

[19:46] <blue_blur64> They've stated that Before the Storm would only be 3 episodes long 
[19:46] <dspnumbalfandood> Time to get lit 

[19:46] <glitch_crazed> @kinggoken theya€™re waiting to see what happens in the final season of the show 

before they decide what to do next with the Telltale game 

[19:46] <nich2440> SI was good, S2 was alright, and S3 was pathetic/ 

[19:47] <skooma_dealer> admit it, who cried during season 1 of twd for telltale 
[19:47] <lolligagg> stream is done or startin? 

[19:47] <nollieflipunderflip> Season 2 of TWD? it was cancer 
[19:47] <glitch_crazed> @nich2440 more so just okay than pathetic 
[19:47] <blue_blur64> starting 

[19:47] <darksydephil> im considering skipping telltale games from now on 
[19:47] <skooma_dealer> :( 

[19:47] <travisvincent> Starting @lolligagg 

[19:47] <stratmanl909> @blue_blur64 well there was a pre order level so idk 

[19:47] <glitch_crazed> @nich2440 Ia€™m super excited for the final season of Walking Dead next year 
[19:47] <dspnumbalfandood> Sike 

[19:47] <darksydephil> seriously, they're always disappointing now, and they release timing of episodes are 

awful, coninciding with other major releases 

[19:47] <blue_blur64> Even the final season of Walking Dead? 

[19:47] <elzorrobot> Hello Phil just go here 
[19:47] <lolligagg> nice

[19:47] <skooma_dealer> you gotta finish twd tho 

[19:47] <glitch_crazed> @darksydephil so are you cancelling your Batman S2 pt then? 

[19:47] <kinggoken> TellTale The Walking Dead fell off ahrd 

[19:47] <nich2440> @DarksydePhil I would at least play TWAU2 and the last TWD season 
[19:47] <suckasurprise> Telltale needs to update their game formula and engine 
[19:47] <nollieflipunderflip> Start the stream already 
[19:47] <travisvincent> lol 

[19:47] <darksydephil> no, im just not playing more Batman until htere' sa new episode

[19:48] <blue_blur64> They did though @suckasurprise , did you not see the walking dead collection? 

[19:48] <mxavier91> I think with the layoffs they had recently, they take their time on the next TellTale game

[19:49] <mattty3888> phil were you hungover 

[19:49] <djhuoshenz> hi phil how are you doing tonight? 

[19:50] <leewanner> @DarksydePhil -1 feel weird telling you what I think, because I don't feel it's really my 
place... that being said, the Telltale games are so "Bleh". I liked the first Walking Dead ones, but eventually the 
series game to irritate me. I think because they do not seem to fit what are regard to be legitimate games. Never 
mind the fact that decision have little to do with the results. 

[19:50] <zombiebeer> yeah phil how was last night, did you get the spins? 

[19:50] <yothatstuff> is hitman worth it now tho? ive been wondering

[20:27] <captcaveman4201> PHIL make egg in a hole of bread with fry pan 
[20:27] <iradiumviking> it's not like 1776 or someshit like that 
[20:27] <neospartanhesperos9> There is no story to PUBG 
[20:27] <fluffycactus> Where's the Christmas hat? 

[20:27] <akcksska> erangel! 

[20:27] <mxavier91> There has to be a story 

[20:27] <kingwhiterabbit> I remember when I was in High School being an emo was a fad, now a days we have 
100 genders as a fad. 

[20:27] <mikehuntthedestroyer> "1776 will commence again! If you try and take our guns!"-Alex Jones 
[20:28] <mxavier91> How about all the characters are drug addicts 
[20:28] <bfl_griffon> does anyone know when phil is doing the wwe sims? 

[20:28] <neospartanhesperos9> It’s seems obvious to me this is a map in Eastern Europe though 

[20:28] <fallenl570> nahhh i wanted to go with 1985 cause it reminds me of a couple songs but i thought against 

it @iradiumviking 

[20:28] <mxavier91> and they're all fighting over that last hit 
[20:28] <neospartanhesperos9> probably like near post Soviet era 

[20:28] <infinite_55> @mikehuntthedestroyer The Republic will rise again if you attempt to take our guns.

[20:29] <kingwhiterabbit> Phil why do you have so many haters? I never understood that. 

[20:29] <viper_h> I love your eggs with the hole in the middle recipe though 

[20:29] <bos2161> Haven't had a DSP tries it for a while. That farmhouse burger from the last one is good af lol 
[20:29] <soup_gg> dspCowboy 

[20:30] <viper_h> this game is really hard to get used to if you know fps 

[20:30] <stinkinburrows> I think Phil has so many haters because he is very opinionated and isnt afraid to say 
shit, and he also reacts to the haters, which they love 

[20:30] <mikehuntthedestroyer> @iradiumviking hey viking I just noticed you were here. What's up, buddy 

[20:30] <viper_h> You just want to rush in

[20:30] <geoffthehero> i was an autist until i stopped hating on dsp 
[20:30] <kingwhiterabbit> The haters seem like a cult, that's the crazy part. 

[20:30] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil has haters cause they're obsessed with his personal life and they want him to 
live his life the way they want him to... Which he doesn't do. 

[20:30] <geoffthehero> well actually i still am

[20:32] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil got an idea for a new DSP tries it Taco Bell has a new Five dollar Stacker 
box would you try it for the next DSP tries it 

[20:32] <decidingreaper> @kingwhiterabbit ever tried asking a detractor why 
[20:32] <kingwhiterabbit> How so? 

[20:32] <kingwhiterabbit> I've watched a lot of the hater videos and the complaints they seem to portray are so 
frivolous. 

[20:33] <bfl_griffon> Phil reacts to the haters a lot which kond of fuels them 

[20:33] <stratmanl909> @kingwhiterabbit throughout the years he has said and done some stupid things, 
everybody has 

[20:33] <frankenfunk> The first thing i seen of DSP was one of those how not to play videos, i eventually 
checked out the stream., he's not so bad SeemsGood 
[20:33] <kingwhiterabbit> I know 

[20:33] <kingwhiterabbit> But the haters could say that about almost any youtuber 

[20:33] <stratmanl909> @kingwhiterabbit they also only ever see what they want to see 

[20:33] <viper_h> Don’t get how playing on console can compare to PC 

[20:33] <stratmanl909> @kingwhiterabbit lots of stuff taken out of context and stuff 

[20:34] <viper_h> But I bet that conversation has been had before

personality, but theres no reason to put as much time into being negative as his haters do. I get hate mail when i

[20:37] <kingwhiterabbit> There's no aim assist that's what makes it hard, for me anyway.

[20:38] <bfl_griffon> yeah no aim assist on console is a pain for sure. I feel aim assist would ruin it though 
[20:38] <smackhammerl> phil should be wearing a Christmas sweater, he bought them for only one stream? 
[20:38] <neospartanhesperos9> @frogsonic Phil is wears this character’s beanie Kappa

[20:39] <couldntblawkdood> @bfl_griffon even playing field without aimaisst but gives kbandm users advantage

[20:44] <mxavier91> Take the extended mag 
[20:44] <frankenfunk> good game dood 

[20:44] <lamplight_> pretty sure a ballistic mask would be more for shrapnel but i guess thats close enough 
[20:44] <riley_212> Lol 

[20:44] <neospartanhesperos9> Extended mag was my fav perk when I use to play COD 

[20:44] <mikehuntthedestroyer> I know CFA is homophobic but I dont care. They could call me a slur to my 

face and I’d still eat their chicken 

[20:44] <bfl_griffon> cheer 10 menu looting glitches sometimes it sucks 
[20:45] <kingwhiterabbit> @eclonic good question man. 

[20:45] <xboxl_is_garbage> Good thing extended mag was not a perk 

[20:45] <mxavier91> Last Meal would be Chinese food 

[20:45] <notaznlee> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage 

[20:45] <neospartanhesperos9> @Xboxl_is_garbage My bad, an attachment 

[20:45] <couldntblawkdood> good Phil positive vibes for sure dood 

[20:45] <infinite_55> Lol

[20:45] <goldencolts> the most beast attachment was rapid fire 
[20:45] <ursinhopimpaoking> galera, pq ele consegue jogar nesse maapa? 

[20:45] <goldencolts> only true pros could use it 

[20:45] <skooma_dealer> my last meal would be a porterhouse and lobster with herb butter, baked potato and 
german chocolate cake 

[20:46] <fallenl570> @Skooma_Dealer what about tacos? will Chik fil a attack taco bell for selling food at your 
house? 

[20:46] <frankenfunk> ive never has beef Wellington., so i would want that for my last meal cause it looks 
delicious 

[20:46] <skooma_dealer> @Lallenl570 chick fila cant compare cause taco bell is open Sundays roll 
[20:46] <sickogrind> I love these moments in pubg with nothing going on 

[20:46] <neospartanhesperos9> But in MW I would use M16 with red dot sight, stopping power, conditioning, 
and bandolier 

[20:47] <suckasurprise> "So Phil what do you want for your last meal?" Phil: I'd like some penne 

[20:47] <kingwhiterabbit> I like when Phil plays PUBG for some reason, even if he gets killed at the begining. 

[20:47] <bos2161> I’d want pizza rolls, so i could scream "I love tostitos" right when they kill me. 

[20:47] <fallenl570> my last meal would be a burger i create and a whole cheesecake 
[20:47] <stratmanl909> i preferred black ops over mw 

[20:47] <mikehuntthedestroyer> My last meal would be a Cheesecake Factory burger, medium well with 
frikandel on the side 

[20:47] <xboxl_is_garbage> Why do the vehicles sound so unrealistic 
[20:47] <neospartanhesperos9> They all sucked after Black Ops I Kappa 



[20:47] <bfl_griffon> id just get a 2 for $5 from mcdonalds for my last meal because fuck it 
[20:47] <couldntblawkdood> @xboxl_is_garbage sounds like leafblowers

[20:47] <mxavier91> What are your opinions on Infinite Warfare 
[20:48] <eclonic> minin cheesecake... Kreygasm 

[20:48] <zahvone> Five guys burger, Sweet baby rays bbq sauce, crinkle fries, and a monster energy drink.

[20:53] <youngcud> Jesus rose from the dead 
[20:53] <youngcud> Jesus is lord 

[20:53] <stratmanl909> @poopshortsjr not as black and white as that 
[20:53] <mxavier91> requiem for a dream is great

[20:53] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil I resubbed too phil but i didnt put a message 

[20:53] <mikehuntthedestroyer> @Frankenfunk That and Trainspotting are two movies that made me never want 
to do drugs 

[20:53] <hobbsl017> @BOS2161 the human centipedes are a PG rating compared to 120 days of sodom and 
Serbian film 

[20:53] <frogsonic> he's the reason for the season Kappa

[20:54] <iradiumviking> zalo also @mikehuntthedestroyer 

[20:54] <hobbsl017> when 120 days of sodom came out the director got killed 3 days later and it was banned in 

so many countries 

[20:54] <mxavier91> Don’t die phil 

[20:54] <stratmanl909> @poopshortsjr 2 german shepards however you spell it :p 
[20:54] <thecocodonkey> I think brink is one of the worst i played. 

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> LOTR trilogy was the best book-to-movie project I had ever seen. Not all story 
details were correct, but the world felt so real and they worked so hard on make up, costume, and production 
design 

[20:54] <decidingreaper> @thecocodonkey final fantasy 13 

[20:54] <iradiumviking> never mind it's the same movi different name @hobbsl017

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> photography and filmography was amazing, everything was perfect 
[20:55] <goldencolts> automobile safety is very important 

[20:55] <frankenfunk> I do love the music in Requiem for a dream tho.. and it fits the movie so well 

[20:55] <jesterkl> LOTR was great 

[20:55] <pwnage_101> Agreed @NeoSpartanHesperos9 

[20:55] <bfl_griffon> does #charity do something 

[20:55] <poopshortsjr> Pit bulls east German shepards.

[20:55] <bfl_griffon> @zahvone awesome, thanks 

[20:55] <hobbsl017> 120 days of sodom. Serbian film, i spit on your grave, and cannibal holocaust are the 4 
most fucked up

[20:55] <timboslicegb> i wish phil did not run away from people 
[20:55] <kekon3> It's lit 

[20:56] <poopshortsjr> Stay away from pit bulls, that's all I'm saying.

[20:56] <pureo_nikku> p excited 

[20:56] <solid_fantasy> cheer70 Jumanji is actually good, it's a family friendly adventure movie that shockingly 
understands video game mechanics, but marketing is selling it like a dumb comedy #Charity

[20:57] <timboslicegb> it did suck 

[20:58] <goldencolts> theres this video of pitbulls attacking a cat for no reason when out for a walk which is rage 
inducing 

[20:58] <jesterkl> HeyGuys ? 

[20:58] <xboxl_is_garbage> Every single dc movie is absolute trash tho

[21:04] <poopshortsjr> I think you should go to the middle so when the circle gets smaller it'll be easier for you. 

[21:04] <couldntblawkdood> star wars sequels are the most overreacted movies of this century 

[21:04] <mxavier91> Raiders got Fucked HARD by that notecard lol 

[21:04] <couldntblawkdood> overrrated 

[21:04] <timboslicegb> phil says he has learned to play... but he hides all game

[21:04] <frogsonic> the prequels were pretty terrible 



[21:04] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Who liked Rose in the new Star Wars movie? I loved her character 
[21:04] <zahvone> If you don’t think Mariah Carey is gorgeous, you're a liar. Come Debate me. 

[21:04] <kingwhiterabbit> I hat the new star wars trilogy, It's ironic to say that I like the Phantom Menace more 
than the new trilogy. 

[21:04] <stratmanl909> the orginal star wars trilogy are the best by far 

[21:04] <pureo_nikku> raiders couldn’t do us a solid ;_; 

[21:04] <bethebaby> @timboslicegb That's how you play lol 
[21:04] <poopshortsjr> Go pron.

[21:33] <couldntblawkdood> the voice of an angel 

[21:33] <kinggoken> why do people give donations to people that are already rich?? 

[21:33] <creamcancel> i dono 

[21:33] <zahvone> @Kinggoken It’s a human flaw. It's science, really. 

[21:33] <zombiebeer> i assume they enjoy what there are watching 
[21:33] <soul_essl2> @Kinggoken because they like their content? like duh? 

[21:33] <conan_the_barbarian> shroud was a pro CSGO player..and i think he is making even more money just 
streaming these days 

[21:33] <44kpanda> This ain't Monster Hunter! 

[21:33] <couldntblawkdood> @kinggoken haha because they are intelligent individuals 
[21:33] <kinggoken> lmao 

[21:33] <butter_my_bread> phil has an amazing radio voice dood Kappa 

[21:33] <zahvone> Summit was also pro for a small time. 

[21:33] <bfl_griffon> @kinggoken they feel that the people are deserving of the money they earn 



[21:33] <bighankjenkins> you need books too 
[21:33] <goldencolts> a bookbag KappaRoss 

[21:33] <frankenfunk> because they enjoy their content and for some of them they just want to get noticed by 
someone popular 

[21:33] <mikehuntthedestroyer> @Kinggoken cause the only reason they are rich is because people support 
them, duh? lol 

[21:33] <sephirothskian> this game should not be played or exist on xbox gg 

[21:34] <zahvone> A lot of eSports athletes get more money from streaming than competition, actually 

[21:34] <zahvone> Sponsors, ads, cheers, donations, etc etc. Adds up quickly 

[21:34] <sephirothskian> this game should not be played or exist on xbox gG 

[21:34] <neospartanhesperos9> "eSports athletes" LUL 

[21:34] <soul_essl2> @Kinggoken you sound a little salty m8 

[21:34] <creamcancel> CYBERATHLETES 

[21:34] <zahvone> Once you get to a certain point, you'll start generating so much passive income even when 
you're not streaming. 

[21:34] <bighankjenkins> @Zahvone "athletes" KappaHD 

[21:34] <zombiebeer> or if there is a huge audience and they get the streamers attention is usually what they like 
[21:34] <kinggoken> its cause I am lol @soul_essl2 

[21:34] <bethebaby> Didn’t Phil ram something with the bike and that's why it blew up? 

[21:34] <thacoocooparade> "Pro Gamers" LUL 

[21:34] <zahvone> I call them eSports "athletes" because the United States gives players an "athlete" visa. 

[21:34] <xboxl_is_garbage> Maybe Phil can build his own house one day like syndicate did 
[21:35] <conan_the_barbarian> does everyone think esports is actually "sports"? 

[21:35] <neospartanhesperos9> I rather call them gamers, not athletes. 

[21:35] <bfl_griffon> @bethebaby he phased through a shed wall 

[21:35] <frankenfunk> I really dont think it should be called esports.. its just kinda stupid., you're playing a 
video game 

[21:35] <couldntblawkdood> aren’t chess players considered athletes? 

[21:35] <stratmanl909> they just sit downplaying games all day 

[21:35] <cdn_tynan> Ive played about 30 rounds tonight and they are all on the new map.anyone else 

having this problem? 

[21:35] <blowchunx> TheyCallMeTXT best stream 
[21:35] <zahvone> They are, yes. @couldntblawkdood 

[21:35] <bethebaby> @BFL_Griffon So it wasn't like he was driving and it just went up in flames then? 

[21:35] <kinggoken> lrnao @blowchunx 

[21:35] <frankenfunk> yeah, it takes dedication and focus and stuff., but its not a sport 

[21:35] <zahvone> Still not sure why people are so fucking anal about calling people eSports athletes. It's just a 
term. 

[21:35] <kinggoken> Gaming is not a sport 

[21:35] <zahvone> Literally the government gave it to them. 

[21:35] <kinggoken> just my opinion 

[21:35] <succkonlemon> this game barely run on pc 

[21:35] <couldntblawkdood> Lol athletes 

[21:36] <0megaj0ker> How well has Phil played? 

[21:36] <kinggoken> there can be pro gamers but thats about it 

[21:36] <neospartanhesperos9> Cause in sports, you someone who is athletic is someone who actually runs and 
is flexible 4Head 

[21:36] <frankenfunk> not very well

[21:39] <zahvone> #Greenwall 

[21:39] <kinggoken> faze rain...so he is a youtuber 

[21:39] <zahvone> Let's go OpTic 

[21:39] <neospartanhesperos9> @Zahvone I don’t care what the paper work says. What they do is not "athletic". 
I can't wait to see 30 years from now people giving up real sports where you use your legs and stamina, to play 
video games and call themselves athletes 

[21:39] <conan_the_barbarian> do you guys like individual esport like Street fighter or a team based esport like 
CSGO? 

[21:39] <xboxl_is_garbage> Faze rain had the first 2017 r8 in America lol balling out flexing 
[21:39] <couldntblawkdood> @neospartanhesperos9 it's a possible reality, sadly 



[21:39] <zahvone> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Hate to tell you but eSports is watched more than the NFL, and 
generates more money. 

[21:39] <suckasurprise> I prefer individual esports like Street Fighter and Starcraft 
[21:39] <universepope> Phil, play some CSGO again dspAngrydsp 
[21:39] <beat43210> I like both @conan_the_barbarian 

[21:39] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Faze Banks is a liar and tries to act like a badass threatening legal action every 
time someone bumps into him at a bar :D 

[21:39] <soul_essl2> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 when someone does something professionally like they do its a 
sport. Just because you consider something not a sport doesn’t make it true. 

[21:39] <zahvone> I don't know why everyone gets so anal about a term that's not even offensive. 

[21:40] <creamcancel> @conan_the_barbarian i like lvl, like street fighter and doom/quake 
[21:40] <neospartanhesperos9> @Zahvone What about, the real football? CoolStoryBob 
[21:40] <kinggoken> Faze Rain swimming in money like the duck from Duck Tales

[21:40] <goldencolts> uh 

[21:40] <neospartanhesperos9> Soccer CoolStoryBob 

[21:40] <couldntblawkdood> @zahvone it's more offensive actual athletes more than anything 

[21:40] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> oh my god who gives a fuck about the definition of athlete, get over it you 

virgins, nobody cares 

[21:40] <stratmanl909> remember phil sang the duck tales song 
[21:40] <zahvone> Oh, yeah I'm not sure about that, lol 
[21:40] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil camping btw CoolStoryBob 
[21:40] <soul_essl2> @Zahvone idk Neo is sounding like a tard 
[21:40] <zahvone> Soccer is fucking huge 

[21:40] <conan_the_barbarian> i don't think Phil has ever played CS games. 

[21:40] <zahvone> @soul_essl2 Everyone is entitled to their opinions. :)

[21:42] <zahvone> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 I wasn’t using that statistic to determine or skew the term eSports to 
be more valid. 

[21:42] <skooma_dealer> f 



[21:42] <conan_the_barbarian> when will we see your top 10 games of the year? 

[21:42] <zahvone> But esports is watched more (as a whole) than many us sports. 

[21:42] <0megaj0ker> Phil would advertise Bison bucks 

[21:42] <saxondrake> I went to high school with Rhett and Link 

[21:42] <mikehuntthedestroyer> @Kinggoken He did it while all while shitting on the developers LUL

[21:43] <zahvone> @mikehuntthedestroyer but can you measure it in the speed of shadow? Hey Vsauce, 

Michael here 

[21:43] <saxondrake> They were a grade ahead of me. 

[21:43] <neospartanhesperos9> @Zahvone It's just really weird for someone who grows up playing a traditional 
team sport or is a track/field athlete to be hearing that people who play eSports are athletes. Yes, it clearly 
bothers me. 

[21:43] <heybosspossi> Tell us again why youtube sucks papa phil KappaClaus 
[21:43] <majinboo3> AK only good if your close 

[21:43] <conan_the_barbarian> bob sapp? LOL i remember that guy getting his ass kicked in Pride MMA 
[21:43] <majinboo3> long range it is useless 

[21:43] <bighankjenkins> AKM for full auto close quarters.. M16 as your DMR 
[21:43] <shortnosesonlyrescueteens> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 get over it 
[21:43] <kinggoken> youtube fell off 

[21:43] <bethebaby> Logic dictates the M16 would be better, since lighter recoil = better accuracy, but it's a 
video game soooo. 

[21:43] <neospartanhesperos9> @ShortNosesOnlyRescueTeens Nope CoolStoryBob 

[21:43] <zahvone> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Oh no, I totally get it man dont' worry, my grandpa is the same way,

[22:17] <calinks> @Zahvone Thanks yea i need to play more and get better, its pretty hard 
[22:17] <stratmanl909> never watched a wwe sim 
[22:17] <44kpanda> Take that energy drink you damn fool! 

[22:17] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone how is the co-op? 

[22:17] <zahvone> @Calinks You on console or PC? 

[22:17] <calinks> Console 

[22:18] <zahvone> @conan_the_barbarian It's fantastic man. So good! Just the idea that you're competing 
against each is awesome as well 

[22:18] <zombiebeer> phil needs to drink during the wwe sims 
[22:18] <viper_h> buggy hype 

[22:18] <slimesunday98> Phil thoughts on eminems new album 

[22:18] <zahvone> @Calinks Yeah it's gonna be difficult. Don’t worry, you'll get better I promise. 



[22:18] <calinks> Woot! 

[22:19] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone i’m on Arx now....lol finally 
[22:19] <jewbacca2o3> Whats better Fortnite or PUBG? 

[22:19] <stratmanl909> @JewBacca2o3 same thing Kappa 

[22:19] <zahvone> @JewBacca2o3 Both are different. Fortnite is easier to play, and has crafting / cross 
platform. Pubg is grittier and more "real". 

[22:20] <calinks> Think that depends on prefernce but on console Fortnite runs far far better 
[22:20] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone getting closer to the endgame 
[22:20] <viper_h> I like watching Phil play this 
[22:20] <zahvone> @conan_the_barbarian What class you running? 

[22:20] <genesisdestiny> smugglers run? 

[22:20] <timboslicegb> i get turned off by the buliding in fortnite

[22:21] <zahvone> @conan_the_barbarian We took a break from the game about a month ago unfortunately. :(. 
Im’ plying the skeleton origin story. 

[22:21] <zahvone> She is Sebile 

[22:21] <timboslicegb> pubg is amazing fun on pc once tge xbox version gets fixed and runs better people will 

see why its so populer on pc 

[22:21] <viper_h> Stay on the outskirts 

[22:22] <zahvone> Honestly like, even if people don't get many kills, this is still watchable. 

[22:22] <universepope> No, it's hot garbage on PC as well. 

[22:22] <zahvone> LOL

[22:22] <bighankjenkins> you were gonna win that one Phil 
[22:22] <chairmancaleb> My gosh, lol 

[22:22] <bethebaby> Someone actually predicted 3 crashes, too. 

[22:22] <youngcud> 01 PC studder ol times 
[22:22] <universepope> GARBAGE 

[22:22] <calinks> I was watching some youtube vids and was shocked at how great Phil was at Cuphead. 
[22:23] <eldeadmariachi> Rekt rip lol 

[22:23] <chairmancaleb> This game should never have been released in this state, I'm sorry. Devs should have 
waited until it was more stable. 

[22:23] <calinks> Like right away he had great sills 

[22:23] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone i'm really tempted to do multiple runs through the game but it is so 

time consuming and addictive...not sure whether i will do it or not 

[22:23] <viper_h> $30 pre-release software 

[22:23] <a7x_nightmare> The last patch made the crashes worse 

[22:23] <neospartanhesperos9> @ChairmanCaleb b-b-b-but, the money... 

[22:23] <bighankjenkins> AAA BR game please. 

[22:23] <zahvone> @conan_the_barbarian I can't even wait to touch on the GM mode. Would love to write my 
own campaigns and send them off to people. It's so cool, really it is 
[22:23] <dannyhikari> What are you doing Christmas day? 

[22:23] <bethebaby> @ChairmanCaleb It's unacceptable, it really is. People will make excuses, like "oooh it's 
early access" and shit but there's no excuse. 

[22:23] <calinks> I got to say @ChairmanCaleb I have bought two other preview games and they are nowhere 
near as buggy on day 1 

[22:23] <universepope> TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo

[22:24] <eldeadmariachi> Three crashes: Bandicoot, Cortex strikes back, Warped. 

[22:24] <zahvone> @elDeadMariachi You've earned my respect. 

[22:24] <calinks> This is taking forever haha 

[22:24] <a7x_nightmare> The thing is., it wasn’t this bad before the patch. 

[22:24] <pwnage_101> @elDeadMariachi That’s a good one lol 
[22:24] <calinks> WOW 

[22:24] <timboslicegb> @gabriel_ko because in in preview program 

[22:24] <chairmancaleb> @bethebaby Even for an early access, the PC version from what I understand doesn’t 
crash like whatsoever. And if there are crashes, they're mainly related to user errors than anything. 

[22:24] <youngcud> And never be a multi platform we type either 

[22:24] <iradiumviking> helllo 

[22:24] <zahvone> Yo 

[22:24] <chairmancaleb> @Calinks Exactly. 

[22:24] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone lol i completely forgot about the DM mode, i'm so into the single
