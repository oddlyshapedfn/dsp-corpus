[22:54] <factorbactorjr> tipping is more fun 

[22:54] <masterxeon2002> do twitch goals instead of patron? 

[22:54] <markymark52> it's because you have to go to an external site to do it. Tips are integrated in Twitch.

[22:55] <nitrozeus2000> Dilly dilly 

[22:55] <chaddargo> Phil's detractors have a ridiculous sort of resentment and hatred. They are really going to 

dislike Phil's recent successes and such. Fuck those people 

[22:55] <masterxeon2002> fuck the taxes get dual xeons Kappa 

[22:55] <markymark52> that and you have to create a patreon account to pledge.

[22:56] <tevin> mort > God 

[22:56] <jannedaarcl35> I think this is Phil's best day on stream for making money 

[22:56] <thatanonyraccoon> @DarksydePhil Was the $450 tip from the same source as the $1000 tip? 

[22:56] <majinboo3> Its because they dont want to subscribe they just want a one time donation 
[22:56] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Erm.... 

[22:56] <artisancraft> To be honest, the detractors just intrigue me. If you hate or not like someone.... just move 
on and watch people you DO like. It puzzles me. 

[22:56] <markymark52> Mort was my favorite tipper. 

[22:56] <extracheeez> @kozatof yeah not normally but pubg is so toxic on xbox maybe he can make an 
exception

[22:59] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 I have never been a Carvajal fan. Gets caught out a lot and 
isnt even great going forward. Not good enough for Real

[22:59] <jannedaarcl35> 2 crashes! 

[22:59] <thespiccoli> @JanneDaArcl35 I've thought about going back. It would be nice to have a masters/doc 

[22:59] <kozatof> @bigboydumper of course he was 

[22:59] <44kpanda> celebrity crush: Danny DeVito

[23:00] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 League isn’t over I don't think. Literally the same way 

Barcelona had a complete turn around after the Super Cup, they could have a complete turn around next week. 

Tough games coming up, nothing guaranteed. Best of luck ;p
