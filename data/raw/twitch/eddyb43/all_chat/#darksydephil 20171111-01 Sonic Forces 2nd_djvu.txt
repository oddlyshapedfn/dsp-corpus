[12:36] <odddishh> Heavy Rain remix! I havent heard this in YEARS. Loved that playthrough man. AHH Lamp 
Sttack! 

[12:36] <takumibun> Phil if you created this remix I'll give you props PogChamp 

[12:36] <bass619> yikes 

[12:37] <nightbot> ratchefanl2 just tipped $5.00 

[12:37] <theycallmejimbob> falcon punch Poooound KAPOW 

[12:37] <odddishh> I used to play this song more than a person should 

[12:38] <theycallmejimbob> going back in time VoHiYo 

[12:38] <donkyschlong69> phil for american idol? 

[12:38] <wxrxaxtxh> anyway to extend trails on ea access? 

[12:39] <sonicwe> phil beats this in 2 hours 

[12:39] <takumibun> We need a MGS3 remix PogChamp 

[12:39] <sonicwe> so much extra stream time 

[12:39] <bionich00t> This game is shit though, I just enjoy Phil's gameplay for it 
[12:39] <wxrxaxtxh> i guess not 

[12:39] <bionich00t> This is the worst Sonic game since Boom imo 
[12:39] <sonicwe> its not shit just disappointing 
[12:39] <coeyse> I thought it was great 
[12:39] <sonicwe> boom was broken 

[12:39] <donkyschlong69> next: "thugs on the floor" or "everybody in this games uses dual shooty"? 

[12:40] <bionich00t> It's really bad. Very short, too easy, terrible story, most of the music is annoying dance 
music. 

[12:40] <sonicwe> and not finished 

[12:40] <bionich00t> Phil's gameplay is the saving grace 

[12:40] <blue_blur64> Not even close Bionic xD 

[12:40] <bionich00t> I'm a big fan of Lost World so what do I know I guess 

[12:40] <coeyse> Boom was a complete mess but Lorces was really fun. It had a few small moments where the 
level design wasn't too great, but I really liked the story and music. 

[12:40] <theycallmejimbob> I spawn I die is probably my favourite of the bunch dspHinm 
[12:40] <blue_blur64> I like Lost World too 
[12:40] <sonicwe> have you played a sonic game 

[12:40] <coeyse> Game was a little easy sure but most modern Sonic games have been. There were a few 
moments that challenged me, but yeah. 

[12:40] <bionich00t> Lost World had the best story by a mile 
[12:41] <sonicwe> this is just short 

[12:41] <bionich00t> Eggman and the Deadly Six were underrated in Lost World 
[12:41] <donkyschlong69> tig bittys 
[12:41] <sonicwe> lost world was bland 

[12:41] <bionich00t> This game doesn't even have boss fights for all the villains they advertised. 

[12:41] <coeyse> Lost World was good but I didn’t care for the writing, it was a little TOO Saturday morning 
cartoon-y 

[12:41] <blue_blur64> Eh, I disagree on story. The Deadly Six were too one dimensional 

[12:41] <coeyse> Oh yeah that was disappointing for sure 

[12:41] <bionich00t> You got to admit the Lost World story is better than this 

[12:41] <howlingwolfjoey> Linally, a Sonic game. Better than a Mario game. >:3 

[12:41] <coeyse> Lost World was really fun aside from the level design feeling a little experimental 

[12:42] <blue_blur64> Not really Bionic. I was getting tired of pure comedy that Lost World, even with its dark 

points, was. 

[12:42] <takumibun> "this is not Sparta, fuck your motha" 

[12:42] <comfrtblynumb> what 
[12:42] <takumibun> so done 
[12:42] <comfrtblynumb> is 



[12:42] <coeyse> Forces was a good mix between Generations/Colors and Lost World but I do agree on the 
length. A lot of elements really could've been gone into depth, plotwise 
[12:42] <comfrtblynumb> this 

[12:42] <theycallmejimbob> slaps howlingwolfjoey with a large trout SabaPing 
[12:42] <donkyschlong69> Its Phils audition mix for american idol. 

[12:42] <theromanspartan> Not gonna lie... still better than the PS4 music. 

[12:43] <blue_blur64> Yes, the length everyone can agree on. But seeing how much I've been replaying these 
stages collecting everything (and not turning off the radio for anything) says something 
[12:43] <takumibun> @theromanspartan true 
[12:43] <blue_blur64> on how much fun I'm having 

[12:43] <coeyse> Forces could really use some more stuff; I totally agree on that. I wish they gave us a bit more 
because grinding for the ranks and outfits feels a little shallow when there's not even that many levels, otherwise 
I adored the game. 

[12:43] <bionich00t> @blue_blur64 Eh, I didn’t mind a newer, darker direction that Forces was supposed to 

take, but it's horribly executed. Lost World is light hearted but executed well imo 

[12:43] <howlingwolfjoey> @theycalhnejimbob Oi! >:T *slaps @theycallmejimbob with a bass* 

[12:43] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[12:43] <coeyse> Forces has good tone. Personally my favorite tone was the ones the Genesis games had and the 
one that the Adventure games had. 

[12:43] <comfrtblynumb> BRAVOOOO 

[12:43] <blue_blur64> I'm actually about to collect the last red rings now 

[12:43] <bionich00t> Every Deadly Six gets boss fight(s), and Eggman's hijacking of the plot is refreshing, 
unlike in this game. 

[12:43] <takumibun> MORE REMIX 
[12:43] <donkyschlong69> noooooo, more music 

[12:43] <coeyse> Adventure 2 was hilarious with how batshit and over-the-top it was. 

[12:43] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello dspPepe 
[12:43] <heybosspossi> dspPepe 

[12:44] <sonicwe> lost world tried too hard and the deadly six were Id af 
[12:44] <sonicwe> infinite is better than all of them 
[12:44] <theycallmejimbob> I thought everyone calls him Dave dspHinm 
[12:44] <elipsion> No we call you Dave 

[12:44] <bionich00t> Lost World are the best Sonic characters in decades 

[12:44] <takumibun> PHILLY 

[12:44] <jesseplaysz> is sonic forces worth buying? 

[12:44] <theromanspartan> Philiam P.B., Big Papa Phily B 
[12:44] <kekon3> I call you that all the time obviously Kappa 

[12:44] <bionich00t> Deadly Six has some worse characters but I found them more fun overall than Infinite, 
there's 6 of them 

[12:44] <vendatus> Phil did you get the free episode shadow die? LUL 
[12:44] <sonicwe> no the hard boiled heavys are better 

[12:44] <coeyse> I liked Infinite a lot but he needed to be gone into a bit more, plotwise 
[12:44] <theycallmejimbob> going back in time VoHiYo 
[12:45] <odddishh> Oh lamp Attack!! 

[12:45] <blue_blur64> he did Vendatus 

[12:45] <bionich00t> How are Hard Boiled Heavies not one dimensional 
[12:45] <sonicwe> they don't talk 

[12:45] <coeyse> What? Why would they not be one-dimensional? There's basically no dialogue in that game. 

[12:45] <howlingwolfjoey> It should've been Deadly Seven. T_T 

[12:45] <vendatus> SeemsGood 

[12:45] <coeyse> Same with the Genesis titles. 

[12:45] <takumibun> GIVE THIS CREATOR AN OSCAR 



[12:45] <nightbot> TakumiBun -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[12:45] <theromanspartan> It's a good change. 

[12:45] <cobrastrike09> cheerlOO Saturday Stream Hype 

[12:45] <bionich00t> Just saying, Heavies and Deadly Six are both "one dimensional," but Deadly Six have 
more depth. 

[12:45] <ellich86> luptime 

[12:46] <coeyse> I liked the Deadly Six. They were fun enough. Honestly I just kind of like Sonic; not a huge 
fan of overly goofy and lighthearted but I'm fine with whatever direction they start to take the series with. Forces 
showed a lot of potential and I'm hoping they continue with it and improve on it. 

[12:46] <donkyschlong69> btw. Today is SinglesDay. Congrats to every free man. 

[12:46] <sonicwe> depth noo 
[12:46] <vendatus> LUL 
[12:46] <theycallmejimbob> 4 hours dspShock 
[12:46] <theromanspartan> $60? 

[12:46] <takumibun> 4 hours Residentsleeper 

[12:46] <bullitclub> Phil,have you ever lived in the southern part of the U.S? 

[12:46] <howlingwolfjoey> I wanna know who's the 7th member in the Deadly Six. _3_ 

[12:46] <sonicwe> they are legit nothing more than stereotype to the max 

[12:46] <bionich00t> Phil you NEED to play Episode Shadow it explains key parts of the plot that make no 
sense otherwise, and it's WAY HARDER than the main game. 

[12:47] <theromanspartan> Ah, $40. 

[12:47] <jesseplaysz> I don't know what to get for switch. SONIC FORCE'S or L.A Noire? it's hard to pick. 
[12:47] <theycallmejimbob> gotta go fast dspShock 

[12:47] <theromanspartan> Honestly, they likely just wanted to get it out before Christmas. 

[12:47] <drilbit777> @Jesseplaysz LA Noire definitetly 
[12:47] <ellich86> NoiNoire imho 
[12:47] <drilbit777> At least LA Noire is a good game 
[12:47] <vendatus> LA Noire easy pick LUL 

[12:47] <coeyse> Honestly I can't get too upset with Sonic. The only really "offensively bad" game was 06 and 

even then that one could’ve been fun enough if the gameplay wasn’t as repetitive and the bugs weren't as messy. 

[12:47] <drilbit777> I got doom and la noire on switch 

[12:47] <takumibun> @jesseplaysz if you like Nintendo then get Sonic 

[12:47] <ellich86> not necessarily good 

[12:47] <bionich00t> LA Noire is a movie so Sonic Forces 

[12:47] <stryderhazuki> People should go an watch the Extra Life Children's Charity stream and give money to 
the kids over this manchild. 

[12:47] <coeyse> I still enjoyed myself when I played 06, but not as much as I could've if I were playing another 
title. 

[12:47] <theycallmejimbob> around 46 dollars for me dspPepe 
[12:47] <ellich86> but better than sonic forces LUL 
[12:48] <vendatus> WutFace 

[12:48] <jesseplaysz> Alright the I'm sold. I'm picking up L.A NOIRE this Tuesday. Wish Phil would play it on 
stream. 

[12:48] <heybosspossi> play doom on the switch kappa 
[12:48] <takumibun> WutFace 

[12:48] <kekon3> Sonic forces is a million times over a train wreck and that made it fun to play 

[12:48] <coeyse> Sonic 06 better than Forces? Oof, I wouldn’t say that at all. People are always really rough on 

Sonic titles, but I suppose they do tend to have a few glaring flaws usually. 

[12:48] <vendatus> the 6Y[Z 
[12:48] <kekon3> wait, I mean sonic 06 
[12:48] <takumibun> WWII PogChamp 

[12:48] <bionich00t> 06 is better than Forces. It has about lOx the content, a lot of bugs, but Forces plays like a 



mobile game 

[12:48] <theromanspartan> L.A Noire is basically an interactive season of law and order. Kappa 

[12:49] <ratchefanl2> hey stryder eat ban 

[12:49] <howlingwolfjoey> Sonic forces»»Mario 

[12:49] <sonicwe> 06 and boom are crap 

[12:49] <theromanspartan> I mean, it's fun, but the gameplay is extremely shallow. 

[12:49] <sipoitghyujko> [schedule 

[12:49] <nightbot> Nov. 11: Sonic Forces at 12:30pm PST! Then more Assassin's Creed Origins at 7:30pm PST 
[12:49] <drilbit777> Sonic forces isnt much better either lol 

[12:49] <coeyse> I dunno personally I really liked Sonic Forces, but yeah we all got different tastes and I think 
that's cool. 

[12:49] <drilbit777> Sonic forces pretty much plays itself 
[12:49] <takumibun> AC Residentsleeper 

[12:49] <bionich00t> I mostly think if you like Forces, it's because you like the character creator, no? 

[12:49] <drilbit777> At least mania let you actually play the game 

[12:49] <jesseplaysz> I never played L.A NOIRE when it came out last generation 

[12:49] <blue_blur64> And I've gotten all of the red rings in Forces now :D 

[12:49] <jesseplaysz> Can't wait for it thou 

[12:50] <sonicwe> oc maker is ok but a bit much 

[12:50] <jesseplaysz> wonder if Rockstar will port RDR2 

[12:50] <coeyse> I was actually really uncomfortable with the idea of making a Sonic OC at first but then I 
ended up really liking him 

[12:50] <vendatus> course Sledgehammer thought they were doing Advanced Warfare 2 till Activision said 
wrong you bitches doing WW2 LUL 
[12:50] <jesseplaysz> on switch 

[12:50] <theromanspartan> Rockstar knows how to write a good story, you'll like it for sure. If you're expecting 
good gameplay though, you'll be disappointed. 

[12:50] <hardybuck4> how many q&a videos? 

[12:50] <theycallmejimbob> Mario VoHiYo 

[12:50] <eternia_forever> Change is a coming ahhhhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaa dspPepe dspHmm :D 
[12:50] <blue_blur64> I'm currently using a biker cat xD 

[12:51] <blue_blur64> Wasn't even intending on it, just happened to make that combination of clothing xD 
[12:51] <bionich00t> Phil should play DRV3 eventually. It's really good, as good as DR2.1 know he’s burnt out 
on Danganronpa but I think he’d really enjoy this game. 

[12:51] <howlingwolfjoey> *slaps @theycallmejimbob with a bass* >:T 
[12:51] <coeyse> My OC is a red cat with kamina shades 
[12:51] <sonicwe> phil your almost done anyway 
[12:51] <eternia_forever> wheres this poll ? 

[12:51] <vendatus> So apparently people liked Justice League LUL 

[12:51] <bionich00t> There's only 30 levels 

[12:51] <ratchefanl2> twitter 

[12:51] <ccous666> go back to tekken 7 man 

[12:51] <majinboo3> Danganronpa V3 is weird as hell 

[12:52] <theycallmejimbob> I thought you were gone howlingwolfjoey NotLikeThis 
[12:52] <sonicwe> ugh Dr v3 pissed off 

[12:52] <theromanspartan> Meh. They do get good views though. 

[12:52] <sonicwe> me 

[12:52] <flamingmangos> Yo PHIL 

[12:52] <flamingmangos> You gonna do Xenoblade chronicles 2? 

[12:52] <bionich00t> I haven't seen the end of DRV3 yet, almost there 
[12:52] <bionich00t> Just hoping the ending isn't too weird and it'll be great! 

[12:52] <theromanspartan> You’re better than me, I would have just said fuck it. 



[12:52] <theycallmejimbob> NFS seems to be winning so far with 35% of the vote Horizon in second with 30% 
dspHmm 

[12:52] <majinboo3> Racing games are always funny as hell with phil 

[12:52] <paddingtonbearl87> nfs will make for a funny playthrough TPFufun 

[12:52] <howlingwolfjoey> @theycallmejimbob fool, you know i’ll never turn down a sonic game 

[12:53] <sipoitghyujko> he dont play jrpgs @FlamingMangos 

[12:53] <eternia_forever> NFS winning @DarksydePhil 35 -30 

[12:53] <theycallmejimbob> my bad howlingwolfjoey NotLikeThis 

[12:53] <jesseplaysz> it been awesome if he plays horizon thou 

[12:53] <theycallmejimbob> Phil can still make an executive decision dspHmm 

[12:53] <jesseplaysz> the frozen wild is great 

[12:53] <coeyse> @howlingwolfjoey Woah you have the same curse? I gotta play all of the new Sonic games, 
too! PogChamp 

[12:53] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob ahhhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaa good day my friend 
[12:53] <flamingmangos> Phil played the tales game though 
[12:53] <jesseplaysz> then what's the point of the poll Phil? 

[12:53] <flamingmangos> I think xenoblade chronicles will make a good playthrough. 

[12:53] <sonicwe> dot hack gu is better 

[12:53] <theycallmejimbob> hey EterniaForever good sir hope you're having a good weekend. 

[12:53] <noobrydar> dspEw 

[12:53] <sipoitghyujko> he dont play jrpgs anymore 

[12:53] <bionich00t> Phil should play Xenoblade 2, he’d love it 

[12:54] <majinboo3> Phil hates 200 hour jrpg 

[12:54] <majinboo3> they arent good for playthroughs 

[12:54] <howlingwolfjoey> @Bionich00t blese no spoilers for V3 for phill 

[12:54] <sonicwe> bersirea is great zestria is shit 

[12:54] <bionich00t> DRV3 is hard to spoil because no one would believe you if you told them the batshit 
spoilers 

[12:54] <majinboo3> Hateful truth son 

[12:54] <howlingwolfjoey> @CoeySE what curse? 

[12:54] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob yes very good sir the stream was up in opens wondering were you 
were yesterday ... 

[12:54] <haseox4> Sup fellow chat people 
[12:55] <bionich00t> sup 

[12:55] <thesupervillain543> wait i thought he was streaming at 1230 
[12:55] <majinboo3> didnt the homefront review get a million views? 

[12:55] <theycallmejimbob> :D I doubt that Eternia Forever but I'm glad you're having a good weekend 
[12:55] <jesseplaysz> I like those review's, bring them back man. I think they'll gain traction. 

[12:55] <bionich00t> phil you need to do more editing 

[12:55] <bionich00t> That's the only way with how youtube works nowadays 

[12:55] <comfrtblynumb> you don't have to put that much effort, just talk to the cam about what you think about 
the game 

[12:55] <alex_dragonul> Dam a miss POP , where are they man , we need a sequel to the 2008 one , enough with 
the AC 

[12:56] <comfrtblynumb> editing doesn’t work pfor phil 

[12:56] <theromanspartan> YouTube for gaming is basically dead at this point. 

[12:56] <bullitclub> editing is gruesome. However, learning it, is fun. 

[12:56] <haseox4> Phil did say he does a mini review when he finishes a game 

[12:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm 

[12:56] <darthradovanviking> except patreon phil 

[12:56] <hardybuck4> why not put your review at the end of your PLAYTHROUGH? 

[12:56] <darthradovanviking> if you where a game rewiver people would maybe support that aspect with you on 



patreon 

[12:57] <sipoitghyujko> its not supposed to be fun tho 

[12:57] <bullitclub> maybe reviews could be for patreon exclusives. 

[12:57] <alex_dragonul> YT is shitty now for gaming 

[12:57] <jesseplaysz> I really wish he do reviews, its ashame he won’t thou boogieSad boogieSad 
[12:57] <namelessmustache> no money = no fun 
[12:57] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[12:57] <theromanspartan> I doubt Phil could really establish himself like that today. 

[12:57] <jesseplaysz> true 

[12:57] <theromanspartan> Game reviewers on YouTube are a dime a dozen. 

[12:57] <eternia_forever> Phil forget about putting a ton of effort into reviews , Sit on your couch do a 15 - 20 
minute thoughts/review on a game . And put that up on youtube old school style with no gameplay in review. 
There you go problem solved ... cheer 150 

[12:57] <butter_my_bread> playing games and having fun on stream is the narrative now folks 

[12:58] <sipoitghyujko> its called work sir 

[12:58] <dinohans> he can upload a review a another media like vimeo, vidme 
[12:58] <hardybuck4> put reviews at end of your playthrough 

[12:58] <bullitclub> It would be cool if you could do one review a month for patreon. Have people vote which 
game they wanted you to review. 

[12:58] <comfrtblynumb> stop this ugly brainstorming 
[12:58] <kinggoken> the best damn stream on TWITCH :)

[14:09] <istayw0ke> this is fantastic 
[14:09] <theromanspartan> Very cheap too. 

[14:10] <rotoch4mp> it needs to be a good one for the pure

[14:10] <fluttershyl970> phill got ass 

[14:10] <theromanspartan> The best gin I've had is Tanqueray, so I can’t say what "good" gin is. Kappa

[14:23] <blue_blur64> There is an end to the bridge :P 
[14:23] <mksushi> Ah I see 

[14:24] <skillz08> stream I have a question, is 50 mbps good for playing fighting games online? 

[14:24] <dislexic_potato> S PogChamp 

[14:24] <blue_blur64> I’ve actually made it to the end of the bridge before and Metal Sonic escapes 




[14:25] <darthradovanviking> @Skillz08 you need at least 1000 terrabits 
[14:25] <eternia_forever> @Skillz08 could be higher but not too bad at all 
[14:25] <theromanspartan> Should be more than fine Skillz. 

[14:25] <djrunol> did phil earlier say that the mask looks like in splinter cell? to me it looks more like a very 
bad star-lord mask 

[14:25] <theromanspartan> Half of the people playing have toaster connections anyway. 

[14:25] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob tough question but what's ur nr 1 game? 

[14:25] <mksushi> @skillz08 yes I have around the same and I rarely lag 

[14:25] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Ouch, that fist bump sounded like it hurt 

[14:25] <hinjakuhinjakuu> @Skillz08 depend on the netcode of the game but it should be okay 

[14:25] <eternia_forever> @DarthRadovanViking i have 28,000 mega flops 

[14:26] <theromanspartan> Also depends on how many porn torrents you have run and stream tabs. 

[14:26] <darthradovanviking> not bad i think, what do you use them to @Eternia_Forever ? 

[14:26] <bertold0926> hello everyone

[14:28] <theromanspartan> @Skillz08 Oh, at&t? Well good luck with that. Kappa 

[14:28] <skillz08> I'm trying to keep cost low so I was thinking of getting a firestick instead of cable with my 
internet. 

[14:28] <theycallmejimbob> speaking of gaming systems Eternia_Forever I bought a PS Vita recently dspShock 
[14:28] <theromanspartan> 50 MBPS* between 3AM and 6AM. 

[14:28] <skillz08> @theromanspartan lol it's America I'm limited BibleThump 
[14:28] <theromanspartan> Throttled to shit 90% of the time. 

[14:29] <skillz08> if I'm on a budget and don’t watch t.v. much would I be better off using a firestick? 

[14:30] <eternia_forever> if you do use live jasmin though what ever you dont give them 2.99 3.99 per minute, 



go to the top right and click on sale banner you get private show for .98 cents per minute which i did do a few 
times lol 

[14:30] <connorxcrash> pjsaltlO #DarksydeTestacles 

[14:30] <theromanspartan> Depends on what you want to watch. Could be fine with Netflix or Hulu. Fire 
stick/Prime video. YouTube TV is a thing now too. PS Vue as well. 

[14:31] <mjll986> With all this recolored stuff, DSP is going to have fun dressing up DSWolf and choosing 
what he wants. 

[14:31] <musclesforbones> @Eternia_Forever, giving the real advice 

[14:31] <theycallmejimbob> WutFace Eternia_Forever 

[14:31] <darthradovanviking> yeah @theycallmejimbob my thoughts exactly 

[14:32] <skillz08> @theromanspartan all I really watch is game of thrones a couple cw network shows and 
wrestling would the firestick be good for that? 

[14:32] <kinggoken> you can put this illegal thing on the firestick that lets you watch current tv shows and 
movies for free lmao 

[14:32] <kinggoken> i don’t recommend it though 

[14:32] <bionich00t> they changed the physics 

[14:32] <vic_bennett> This game, no joke, handles like shit 

[14:33] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob @MusclesForBones @DarthRadovanViking well sadly a few 
times it is true yes but only a few lol dspEw dspEw dspEw the rest of the time i be out there getting the real deal 
lol 

[14:33] <theromanspartan> Honestly, not a clue. I haven’t watched TV in almost 4 years. I just kn ow what 
services exist. MingLee 

[14:33] <kinggoken> Sonic generations seems better than this 
[14:33] <vic_bennett> Way too floaty for sidescrolling levels 
[14:33] <theromanspartan> I'm behind on so much shit. 

[14:33] <musclesforbones> @Eternia_Forever, it's only sad if you didn't enjoy it Kappa

[14:35] <darthradovanviking> Yeah I am not critiquing anyones use of money. On live whatever. But try not 

being that specific. LMFAO 

[14:35] <vic_bennett> inb4 Shadow the Hedgehog 2 

[14:35] <darthradovanviking> in regards to what service and whatever. :P 

[14:36] <blue_blur64> Sounds like Shadow too xD 

[14:36] <eternia_forever> @DarthRadovanViking i have no idea how i brought that up i blame it on the vodka lol 
[14:36] <connorxcrash> Thank goodness no Testacies! 

[14:37] <theycallmejimbob> I have a 3DS and DS EterniaForever which I love, I haven’t really tried the Vita 

out yet had to buy a memory card for it 8gb for around 40 bucks WTRuck 

[14:37] <theromanspartan> The gameplay design for this game is fucking everywhere. 

[14:37] <papalouthefirst> waddup daddyphil 

[14:37] <theromanspartan> $40 for 8gb on a handheld with no games. Kappa 

[14:37] <eternia_forever> do you find that the switch as a hand held is the best of them all ? @theycallmejimbob 
[14:38] <papalouthefirst> psvita 

[14:38] <musclesforbones> I would expect kneepads to look unhappy, considering what they are used for LUL 
[14:38] <musclesforbones> knee protection Kappa 
[14:38] <vic_bennett> Who made this stage select 
[14:39] <musclesforbones> Stan Lee 

[14:39] <theromanspartan> @Vic_Bennett No idea. I guess they played Persona 5 and wanted to steal their 
interfaces too. 

[14:39] <fluttershyl970> no dsp songs cahman 

[14:39] <blue_blur64> Sega owns Atlus @TheRomanSpartan 

[14:39] <eternia_forever> damin i hate this bronze crown stupid twitch for demoting you when you miss a month 
dspPepe dspPepe dspEw dspEw 

[14:39] <theromanspartan> Ah, that makes since @blue_blur64 so they didn’t have any money in the budget for 
interfaces, reused the assets from P5 Kappa 
[14:40] <theromanspartan> * sense 

[14:41] <blue_blur64> @Vic_Bennett The London Symphony Orchestra did 

[14:41] <blue_blur64> I think that's the correct name 

[14:41] <blue_blur64> All the orchestra music was done by them 

[14:41] <theycallmejimbob> yeah Eternia Forever I find it awkward to hold there's a kickstarter for a switch 
grip case I definitely buy it when it's released 
[14:41] <kinggoken> sonic fell off 

[14:41] <rotoch4mp> i ahve ordered persona 5 but has not arrived yet 
[14:42] <blue_blur64> Ok, 2 extra stages left before I've S ranked every level in the game 
[14:42] <theycallmejimbob> damn Eternia Forever dspPepe 
[14:43] <rotoch4mp> somehow 

[14:43] <eternia_forever> hmmm well you probly bought the switch mostly to play on your television or did you 

want to use it as a handheld @theycallmejimbob 

[14:44] <connorxcrash> What happend!? I just got back! :( 

[14:44] <blue_blur64> I've also gotten max honors for 3 of the avatar animals. 4 to go 
[14:44] <eternia_forever> you from Sheffield ? @theycallmejimbob 

[14:45] <theycallmejimbob> :D I prefer the handheld I use my Wii U mostly as a handheld Eternia Forever. I'm 
from Cork in Ireland 

[14:45] <musclesforbones> Irelend eh? you don’t have an accent LUL 
[14:45] <rotoch4mp> good tea from cork

[14:46] <sonicwe> we 

[14:46] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob ahhh ireland then very cool, hmm damin well if you wanted that 
for handheld and are not satisfied with grip i hope that kickstarter works out for you my friend 
[14:47] <blue_blur64> I can link it. Which version do you want? 

[14:47] <theycallmejimbob> MusclesForBones I've met a few people who couldn’t understand a word I said

[14:48] <blue_blur64> Well I S ranked every level in the game now, surprised there's no trophy for it though 
[14:48] <sonicwe> no plat? 

[14:49] <blue_blur64> I still have a bunch of things to do still, like getting all the number rings and silver moon 
rings in each level 

[14:49] <blue_blur64> And there is some grinding to do for the ring collecting and enemy defeating trophies 
[14:50] <blue_blur64> Also need to figure out what the hidden trophies are (not looking them up yet) 

[14:50] <sonicwe> green hill spam

[14:52] * sonicwe sings infinite's theme

[14:53] <musclesforbones> LUL Tails...that's not how that works dummy 
[14:53] <mjll986> nearly...let that sink in for a moment. 

[14:54] <sonicwe> RWBY (Drools)

according to one comment on youtube I saw 

[15:05] <sonicwe> Viking didn’t you hear classic Sonic's music its trash 
[15:05] <huffysan> Gran Turismo 2 has the best music.

[15:38] <dukaduka> then yup, it's entertaining, but it's not really worth your money LUL 
[15:38] <theromanspartan> Honestly, for $40, I'd imagine sonic fans would be satisfied with this. 

[15:38] <theycallmejimbob> true dukaduka I wish Phil did a full playthrough of Homefront the revolution for 
that reason dspPepe 

[15:38] <theromanspartan> Gameplay isn't complete trash, and you're basically paying for a hegehoge creator 

[15:38] <aloofone> i think gamespot gave this a 5 

[15:38] <theromanspartan> do not steal 

[15:38] <sonicwe> maina is $20 

[15:38] <thiccbwoii> @AloofOne delete 

[15:38] <dukaduka> @theycallmejimbob did they ever fix the framerate of that game, because the weapon 
customization was kinda cool 

[15:38] <connorxcrash> @TheRomanSpartan "True dat!" -Tails 

[15:38] <blue_blur64> I think that helmet is supposed to be a reference to Sonic and the Black Knight 
[15:39] <eternia_forever> now certainly in 30 in minutes he will beat the game ? @blue_blur64

Sonic Unleashed to have since the consoles couldn’t handle the game 

[15:57] <chairmancaleb> This sounds like something you'd hear in an anime intro.
