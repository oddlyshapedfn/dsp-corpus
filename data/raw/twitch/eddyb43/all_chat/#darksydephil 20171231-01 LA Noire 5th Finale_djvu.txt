[11:15] <darksydephil> oops i didnt update teh schedule 

[11:15] <darksydephil> let me tdo that now 

[11:15] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[11:16] <bethelewd> j im its cause phil was happy with the fundraiser :D 
[11:16] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm I didn’t BeTheLewd cheers 
[11:16] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil are you taking time off in January? 

[11:16] <darksydephil> now yesterday was so good, today, let's DOUBLE our subs! LOL 

[11:16] <darksydephil> yeah right haha 

[11:16] <bethelewd> yeah unlikely 

[11:16] <yuichimccry> hit the goals yesterday? 

[11:16] <bethelewd> we hit the tip goal 
[11:16] <bethelewd> not the patreon 
[11:16] <factorbactorjr> it would be a miracle lol 
[11:16] <sofiarayne> hi 

[11:17] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil does your community have people that plow the sidwalks, roads, 
drivways, etc or do they make the home owners do it? 

[11:17] <bethelewd> well it is nearly 2018 miracle might happen 
[11:17] <bethelewd> its 4 hours and 14 mins from 2018 

[11:18] <yuichimccry> I am sure by now he has enough to take care of taxes, but I understand having more just 
in case. I know they do let you do installment plans as well. 

[11:19] <darksydephil> BeTheLewd have you not paid attention? 

[11:19] <darksydephil> we far exceeded the tip goal so much that it made up for the patreon 
[11:19] <darksydephil> so im doing the MGS2/3 event, its quite amazing how much support i got 
[11:20] <bethelewd> i wasnt here for the final part of yesterday stream i just read the twitter 



[11:20] <bethelewd> and i know about the event 
[11:20] <scoopula> Sup everyone 

[11:20] <bethelewd> its cool that you got a 1000 cheer again 
[11:20] <bethelewd> :D 

[11:20] <darksydephil> i would be a pretty ungrateful asshole if i didnt do the MGS2/3 event after the amount of 
rallying support i got this weekend 
[11:21] <bethelewd> or tip 

[11:21] <darksydephil> btw if i get 10 more subs today, we earn yet another emote 
[11:21] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil how many people donated yesterday 

[11:21] <bethelewd> you been getting a whole lot of really awesome support the last month so its pretty awesome 

[11:21] <darksydephil> i know Popsicolo is already working on one be i have a new spot already 

[11:21] <darksydephil> lawhorn234 too many to count 

[11:22] <darksydephil> it was quite inspirational actually 

[11:22] <griffmbox> Was this the most you've ever made on a stream? 

[11:22] <yuichimccry> Still not sure why you get so much hate. I have seen far worse than you make a ton more 
money and people think they are the greatest thing ever. 

[11:22] <griffmbox> I wasn't here to see it 

[11:22] <bethelewd> see phil your fans dont want you to suffer or lose your house or see you in trouble, true fans 
of someone will always help out 

[11:23] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil so wait, do you now have enough to completely pay off the interest and 
back taxes? 

[11:23] <bethelewd> also trolls cant do nothing against that 

[11:23] <factorbactorjr> i was only able to give like $ 10 total because i need money for my tuition, but i do what 
i can 

[11:24] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> even detractors helped out with $2 tips, got to love those idiots 

[11:24] <bethelewd> hey detractors a ill leave them alone ok lol 

[11:24] <bethelewd> i mean they troll stupid shit which isnt true 

[11:25] <bethelewd> and they tip with dumb messages which dont get read out 

[11:25] <bethelewd> must be ill 

[11:25] <leonaras> Hey i only troll stupid shit that is true Kappa 
[11:25] <lawhorn234> why are we talking about detractors? 

[11:25] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @Leonaras LUL 

[11:25] <bethelewd> leo time for the sword to come out Kappa 

[11:26] <leonaras> That sounded far gayer than you intended, i think. KappaPride 

[11:26] <bethelewd> depends on what you thought i intended 

[11:26] <bethelewd> could be gayer could be not

[11:27] <griffmbox> Welcome Phil 

[11:27] <sofiarayne> Would like to know your opinion, guys. Does this phrase make any of you guys feel very 
offended? "just don’t buy everything you want all the time even if you have the money" ? 

[11:27] <bethelewd> skoma always gets in trouble 
[11:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> A true

[11:33] <pcgamehunter> I got no drugs, but if I did. I’d take them after new years, not during LUL 
[11:33] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil then why don’t you just assume each month you'll make the lowest 
amount of $$ you've earned, then budget towards that. So if your worst month is only like $4000 a month, then 
budget as if that's what you'll make every month. 

[11:34] <thatotaku> LUL

story, 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house.

[12:03] <lawhorn234> @Skooma_Dealer yeah he needs to budget. I asked if he would take a class on budgeting 



since he is in financial troubles. 

[12:03] <glitch_crazed> @rocthaice24 not to mention the people behind Twitch are planning on making their 

own video sharing site 

[12:03] <skooma_dealer> oh he wont 

[12:03] <rocthaice24> Right 

[12:03] <duderito2> there's always gonna be taxes though given the irregularity of twitch income maybe 

consider a different approach 

[12:04] <skooma_dealer> so is this an admission 

[12:04] <stinkinburrows> @Rocthaice24 I always feel like he limits his interaction with twitch chat to a degree 
because he's worried about how it will affect his yt, if he left yt and focused entirely on twitch, he could interact 
more and draw more subs and cheers, in the end twitch would b more prolific

[12:14] <channel33> FITHY RICH 

[12:15] <imainjoule> which top 10 streamers do you dislike? 

[12:15] <i_came_here_to_something> Money is just a means to an end; it alone can't bring you happiness 

[12:15] <musclesforbones> my secret is that I'm always angry Kappa 

[12:15] <paleemptysphere93> People like Jake Paul.. No talent piece of shit.. xD 

[12:15] <iradiumviking> yes and you are on death row so be careful @Skooma_Dealer 

[12:15] <channel33> cuz they turned 10 k into 50k instead of turning 10k into 30k debt 

[12:15] <thenewfaceofcreation> L 

[12:15] <skooma_dealer> im on death row records 

[12:15] <kingofhypocrisy> Those rich people have big bills to pay

have other people pay your bills? 

[12:15] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi doods 

[12:15] <theycallmejimbob> going back in time VoHiYo 

[12:15] <skooma_dealer> TUPAC LIVES 

[12:15] <bethelewd> skooma and delta are on death row but skooma is a tad bit closer 
[12:15] <thespiccoli> @Skooma_Dealer Walkin the mile...walkin the greeeeen mile 
[12:15] <declan_reed> That's pretty easy to do. 

[12:15] <theycallmejimbob> hey Delta KonCha

[12:15] <bethelewd> welcome back delta now behave 
[12:15] <skooma_dealer> im so scared what will i do 
[12:15] <channel33> WHITE HOT 

[12:15] <i_came_here_to_something> If you get angry at people wishing others a happy new year just b/c they 
have money, that is a very bad character trait imho. But that's just my opinion I guess. 

[12:15] <kingofhypocrisy> FILTHY RICH 

[12:15] <pcgamehunter> Pis SD and Delta are in the kiddy corner Kappa 

[12:15] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe step back from the edge Skooma 

[12:15] <nastytj> Why Phil talks about money everyday when I come here? WutFace 

[12:15] <hns_croatian> cheer 10 Here's to the potential return of Cooking With The King in 2018 it's gonna be a 
good year.

while there's people out there who can’t afford new shoes for their kids this holiday season. Why are you judging 
when one could say the same thing about you? 

[12:16] <channel33> Boogie's wife left him 

[12:16] <stinkinburrows> @jmon_1985 absolutely nothing, if you want gameplay, just go to youtube or go away 
and come back later 

[12:16] <karlis_k> Super Hot... now that's a name of a game with a ring to it 

[12:16] <bethelewd> jim if skooma jumps he will be deleted and will not return, delta is like way away from the 
edge but he is still too close 

[12:16] <pcgamehunter> Oh is that why I'm so sarcastic all the time LUL ?

[12:17] <skooma_dealer> like i love how saying how you feel is bad

[12:17] <bethelewd> jim you need to keep skooma on a leash 

[12:17] <i_came_here_to_something> Phil there are kids with cancer at hospitals that still hold on to happiness 
and hope. I’d rather feel sad for them. You're good dude. You've got a house to stay in, another house to your 
name, and a new girlfriend. Just be happy dude.

[12:18] <enzio814> I think my only issue is that even though he has a house, a car, a easy job....hes still 
constantly asking for help and always stressed and down....but financially making way more than us doing 
something we would all love to do....get paid to play games. 

[12:18] <agoodrpg> no phil we dont we love you

hospital for three weeks with UC, almost dying from SVT and needing an emergency cardiac ablation, and 
having to move twice to keep a roof over my head, but a breakup and taxes are "the worst year of your life?" 
[12:18] <skooma_dealer> that is scary talk 

[12:18] <stinkinburrows> @agoodrpg speak for yourself KappaPride 

[12:18] <toiletanesthesia> It's a bond. As humans, we even manage to connect through screens and light. Quite

[12:19] <stinkinburrows> @Declan_Reed join the club dude, shit was real bad 

[12:19] <pcgamehunter> The reason I watch Phil over most Youtubers is because he always does thing 

differently ... for better or worse LUL 

[12:19] <kingofhypocrisy> 27 

[12:19] <skooma_dealer> that is terrible 

[12:19] <rocthaice24> cheerlO phil feeling the dark side of the force .... the anger gives you strength 
[12:19] <declan_reed> Rambo, because I still tell people Happy New Year 
[12:19] <declan_reed> And I'm still positive.

[12:19] <bethelewd> phil hasnt had any of that declan so he doesnt understand any of that feelings 
[12:19] <i_came_here_to_something> @Seantorious I don't see why. He's better off than most people in this chat 
atm, financially and prob even relationship-wise. He’s not dying from a terimal illness. He's not literally on the 
street. Like, just be happy Phil xD 

[12:19] <declan_reed> He was saying you don’t hear people who struggle being positive. 

[12:19] <stinkinburrows> how dare they b positive and grateful for their success and fans LUL Kappa 

[12:19] <musclesforbones> just the butt? Kappa 

[12:19] <declan_reed> And I'm here to say that's not remotely true. 

[12:19] <skooma_dealer> I watched a parent die its not easy @Declan_Reed 

[12:19] <theycallmejimbob> damn Declan Reed dunno if I could be positive if all that happened to me it's a 
credit to you

[12:20] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil but you put yourself into the situation of not having friends or family by 
moving all the way across the country. I moved to Texas and have no friends/family here but i'm making it. Why 
keep throwing a pity party? Just be happy. 

[12:20] <scoopula> I agree, I can’t stand celebrities who give their fake bullshit happiness.

$2,000 to him???? Seriously!?! I wish people would donate at least $100 a day to me lrnao. Come on. 

[12:21] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe sorry to hear that BeTheLewd this time of year is hard for people 
[12:21] <stinkinburrows> I really dont think Phil knows how to be positive, no troll, not being an ass, but even 
when he talks about being positive it is full of the bad shit 

[12:21] <nolbert87> why does it bug you if people who are well off and have money be positive and say nice 
things to people.? @DarksydePhil 

[12:21] <i_came_here_to_something> Turn your frown....upside down. 

[12:21] <agoodrpg> it does phil

[12:21] <skooma_dealer> i was in a bathtub with my arm sliced open 

[12:21] <toiletanesthesia> @DarksydePhil Try and live in the present. The stuff in April hasn't happened yet. If 
you worry about it, you're just building a scenario that doesn’t yet exist in your head. It’s a waste of mental 
energy. What matters is here, and now. 

[12:21] <theycallmejimbob> :o PC damn 



[12:21] <skooma_dealer> was it that bottom?

[12:22] <wildvagabond> we are with you phil 

[12:22] <i_came_here_to_something> @Seantorious Yeah that's the thing. If Phil could look at his situation in 
context to other people, like in his chat, he’d prob be a lot more grateful and wouldn't have needed to say all that 
stuff earlier on in the prestream. 

[12:22] <skooma_dealer> THATS bottom 

[12:22] <karlis_k> @DarksydePhil you didn't say "f**k it" to streaming and making videos, so I'm not saying 
"f**k it" to DSP 

[12:22] <dproto_3> Thank you , you human pieces of shit, for your money! 

[12:22] <channel33> a large house with a video game business isnt a good idea gotta admit it 
[12:22] <skooma_dealer> having being told you had cancer is bottom 

[12:22] <nelofyzj9yuw> he’s saying this while drdisrespect literally hasnt streamed in almost a month 
[12:22] <lawhorn234> @DarksydePhil but then how would someone making over $80k a year telling me to be 
positive be helpful? 

[12:22] <channel33> unless theres multiple doods 

[12:22] <skooma_dealer> having being told your mother is dying is bottom 

[12:22] <scoopula> Idiots don’t realize that their worst experience is no comparison to anyone elses worst 
experience

[15:01] <skooma_dealer> negativity, it gets thrown around a lot and i wonder is it a ward to ward off bad 
feelings or a cover all 

[15:01] <theycallmejimbob> this is for my channel SwiftRage 

[15:01] <kinggoken> this is my jam

someone not agreeing with you

[15:02] <skooma_dealer> and i find it happens in certain groups of folks 
[15:03] <skooma_dealer> its like a ward to plug your fingers in your ears to not listen 
[15:03] <youngguopfresh> Phil will turn his Acura in to a Benz soon. 

[15:03] <duderito2> You're here everyday moaning about everything he does would that not be negative 
SkoomaDealer you obviously don’t like his stuff so why be here? 

[15:03] <skooma_dealer> I am asking a question

[15:03] <skooma_dealer> answer when im asking 

[15:03] <arcticsurface> @Skooma_Dealer Not agreeing with someone is fine, insulting and harrassing that 
person afterwards because "you dont agree with him" for ever is negativity, and thats an understatement. 

[15:03] <feelthekout> where can i buy this? CoolStoryBob 

[15:03] <skooma_dealer> okay thats fine but what if that person in turn does the same 
[15:03] <skooma_dealer> are they both wrong or both right

[17:58] <pcgamehunter> So basically Fontaine is the ultimate villain in this game 
[17:58] <popsicolo> Elsa should've let it go.

[17:59] <musclesforbones> hopefully this is over soon. I'm starving and want to get some food LUL 
[17:59] <popsicolo> Team Bondi should use this tech to make a Drake and Josh game. 

[17:59] <chairmancaleb> @Stunted No, the arsonist knows that Elsa is innocent, so I think he carried her out so 
he could burn the house down with the doctor. 

[18:00] <bethelewd> pops ahahahah 

[18:00] <impaiacambridge> @Popsicolo Corey in the House would be better 
[18:00] <popsicolo> I think that would be the best use of their resources. 

[18:00] <youngcud> Or Nathan Drake 
[18:00] <chickendinner_91> Pops Bondi is dead 

[18:00] <pcgamehunter> Team bondi should have made the first 360 degree porn instead would have made a

[18:02] <kingofhypocrisy> he's just the shittiest asshole 

[18:02] <chickendinner_91> It's great tech, revolutionary 

[18:02] <popsicolo> They should make a Polar Express game with this tech.

[18:57] <me_ree> he has to get out of his office 
[18:57] <me_ree> make dinner 
[18:57] <me_ree> eat dinner 

[18:58] <me_ree> it's very important that after making dinner, you don’t forget to eat it. I'm so glad he 
remembered that important step 

[18:58] <me_ree> and he has to do some uploading and editing too 
[18:58] <dadoodl3> wash dishes.take a dump... 

[18:58] <me_ree> he never mentioned anything about washing up funnily enough 
[18:58] <dadoodl3> LMAO 

[18:59] <dadoodl3> so he did mention the other??? dont answer... 

[18:59] <me_ree> nope, but I did hope that it won’t interrupt any of the things he has left to do because it'll just 
throw everything out of order 

[18:59] <dadoodl3> wheres popsicola? he had a cool stream last night 

[19:00] <me_ree> he was in here earlier doing his moderating, but i think once phil finished everyone mainly 
scarpered, or are just lurking silently
