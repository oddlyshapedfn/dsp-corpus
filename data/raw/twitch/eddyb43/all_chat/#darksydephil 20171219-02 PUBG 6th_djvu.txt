[19:31] <darksydephil> stream 

[19:31] <kingofhypocrisy> Hello philip 

[19:32] <jagsbestfriend> Hello 

[19:33] <certifiedpizzaman> DSP, The LEGEND! 

[19:33] <kingofhypocrisy> it's pizza time 
[19:34] <segregate> yo 

[19:35] <darksydephil> i also just started the work on the WWE sims for Sunday, holy crap, there’s some good 
stuff to use this year 

[19:36] <kingofhypocrisy> plz included lowtiergod 
[19:36] <kingofhypocrisy> that would be amazing 
[19:37] <darksydephil> you are an idiot 
[19:37] <kingofhypocrisy> what did i do? 

[19:38] <darksydephil> anyway, downloading the PUBG updates now. they double the game's size so hopefully 
these are good 

[19:38] <elzorrobot> helo phil 

[19:38] <darksydephil> let's see, you insulted me as soon as i went offline with a snort, because we all know it's 
funny to make fun of someone’s physical conditions/illness, you bring up LTG like a small child, you are a moron 
[19:38] <elzorrobot> ready for PUBG 

[19:40] <kingofhypocrisy> I wasn't an insult, it was just a joke, I didn't to make you angry or hurt ur feelings. 

LTG is a funny guy and he even offered to do some street fighter matches with you before 

[19:40] <kingofhypocrisy> i didn’t mean to 

[19:41] <thatanonyraccoon> DSP taking names and kicking ass 

[19:42] <segregate> new update? nicee

[19:45] <suckasurprise> I was never really a PUBG fan but Phil's streams of it have been pretty fun 
[19:46] <darksydephil> okay looks like i’m good to go, download finished 
[19:47] <rx93gundamm> hi phillip 

[19:47] <stuart360> Phil the patch has supposed to help with input lag a LOT. But the patch notes do say 'First 
pass performance enhancements’ and as a PC gamer, that means first pass of many, so dont expect 60fps or 
something Phil lol

[22:06] <skooma_dealer> 

[22:07] <suckasurprise> @DarksydePhil You should check the leaderboards, it seems like you’re doing pretty 
good you might be ranked surprisingly high 

[22:07] <ponpondoodlez> @darksydephil Havent kept up with the streams. How did you place #1 before? 
[22:07] <xboxl_is_garbage> This game would be better if it was first person only 

[22:07] * neospartanhesperos9 gets behind Phil and slaps his sides twice and yells "light weight!!! YEEAAA 
BUDDY!" 

[22:07] <stratmanl909> what are the coins for 

[22:07] <lightkunl988> @DarksydePhil Will you go back to Overwatch anytime? 

[22:07] <pcgamehunter> @dukaduka He started saying the things I’ve been saying all game, but I hate him so 
much I don't even care that he's right LUL 
[22:07] <skooma_dealer> MOSH PIT 

[22:07] <dukaduka> @pcgamehunter i'm scared to play it now, i don't want to hate the series lol 
[22:07] <slurpdaddywang> I thought he didn’t like pubg 
[22:07] <calinks> The Pubg bug affecting Phil "Just one more" 

[22:07] <skooma_dealer> MOOSH 
[22:07] <jannedaarcl35> Phil is number 1 of course 
[22:07] <jordanvizer> this game looks so bad lrnfao 
[22:07] <jordanvizer> blurry textures btw 

[22:07] <jannedaarcl35> Didn't they just release a new character for overwatch? 

[22:08] <neospartanhesperos9> No Phil co-op with the best junkrat... dspPepe 
[22:08] <skooma_dealer> is this a slipknot concert

[22:08] <slurpdaddywang> chicken fingers mnim 

[22:08] <jordanvizer> chubby or skinny girls @DarksydePhil 

[22:08] <pcgamehunter> maybe, if they get real time travel writers that know what they're doing 
[22:08] <lightkunl988> It's the only thing... 

[22:08] <goldencolts> a ps3 would be worth a whole dollar at gamestop Kappa 
[22:08] <eternia_forever> Any sessions coming up with the skinny fatman ? cheer25 
[22:08] <xboxl_is_garbage> Isna€™t there a new desert map for this game 
[22:08] <lightkunl988> that slowly stops the aaaache... 

[22:08] <pcgamehunter> @dukaduka You probably won’t, but I’m someone who got into it hardcore because of 
the time travel, so I find some of the stuff personally insulting with how bad it is :D 
[22:08] <dukaduka> @pcgamehunter *turns on sound of silence and looks out the window* 

[22:09] <paddingtonbearl87> oh yeah true 



[22:09] <skooma_dealer> phil was flashing the tiddy 
[22:09] <skooma_dealer> hawt 

[22:09] <neospartanhesperos9> @paddingtonBEAR187 good question man. This means there is still some 

chance he could play Metroid Prime 2 Kappa 

[22:09] <slurpdaddywang> why is the facecam so small? 

[22:09] <thatindieglo> @darksydephil what IS your favorite color? 

[22:09] <pcgamehunter> I also played a way better time travel story before I start life is strange, so the ending 
just made me really pissed. 

[22:09] <paddingtonbearl87> @neospartanhesperos9 Kreygasm 
[22:09] <pinkdam> no spoilers 
[22:10] <jordanvizer> silencer nice 

[22:10] <dukaduka> @pcgamehunter i like it because it had the really tame stuff mixed in with the time travel 
stuff. I'm gonna hold on to hope. Also, what's the other game? 

[22:10] <paddingtonbearl87> i loooove me some metroid InuyoFace 
[22:10] <jordanvizer> you missed a med kit 

[22:10] <neospartanhesperos9> Level 3 backup so you can carry more poke balls PogChamp 

[22:10] <pcgamehunter> @dukaduka Steins;Gate 

[22:11] <kingofcrying> you ran past the guns 

[22:11] <goldencolts> must have landed in the united kingdom 

[22:11] <pcgamehunter> @dukaduka They also did the whole you can’t stop your friend from dying, but they 
solved it way better than LiS... 

[22:11] <dukaduka> @pcgamehunter well steins gate is steins gate so that's not fair LUL 
[22:11] <jacob711w> @goldencolts lol 
[22:11] <kingofcrying> thats a 1911 dude 

[22:11] <neospartanhesperos9> @paddingtonBEAR187 I feel like Phil would love the Light/Dark Aether puzzle 
mechanics in Metroid Prime 2. It would also be a rather difficult game too :D 
[22:11] <butter_my_bread> it has duster like properties dood 

[22:11] <pcgamehunter> Steins gate used the time travel to it's benefit, in LiS it's more like a crutch to overcome 
the boring cringy teen anxst LUL 

[22:11] <skooma_dealer> I was watching this movie call Truck Turner and a hookers pimp was like married to 

her or something and she kept pressing this john for money until they broke his legs

[22:13] <alphaelitetv> high quality textures SeemsGood 

[22:13] <dukaduka> well i’m gonna stay hopeful that this is just a valley for dotnod and they will bounce back 
(but I don’t think they are smart enough to reach steins;gate levels) 

[22:13] <skooma_dealer> Blaxspoiltation movies are so good 

[22:13] <goldencolts> oozi nien millameeta

[22:14] <movieswithmark> Logan is damn good. On my Top 10 list of the year.

writing shitty LUL 

[22:14] <slurpdaddywang> have some courage 

[22:14] <neospartanhesperos9> @Butter_My_Bread dspPepe 

[22:14] <movieswithmark> It's not in the top 5, but certainly top 10 of the year. 

[22:15] <movieswithmark> Baby Driver and Blade Runner 2049 would be higher. 

[22:15] <neospartanhesperos9> @movieswithmark Woah, it's aint that good. KappaRoss ./ 

[22:15] <movieswithmark> Compared to what? I'm talking top 10 of the year. 

[22:15] <mickjones90> it's a playerunknown 

[22:16] <eternia_forever> All the assholes left in this game are left to deal with old Buckeye Burnell the best 
shot west of ct cheer50 

[22:16] <neospartanhesperos9> Blade Runner, Lost City of Z, Dunkirk... etc dspHinm 

[22:16] <pcgamehunter> Wow this part is so bad I just can't be bothered to do the TalkBack challenge thing LUL 
[22:16] <lightkunl988> badumrn ts 

[22:16] <movieswithmark> Yeah, that's why Blade Runner is higher on my list. 

[22:16] <jordanvizer> hallucinations 

[22:16] <butter_my_bread> I wasn't wiod about Get Out. seemed like 2.5 star caliber horror movie and i use 

that term loosely, atleast the girl was a hottie 
[22:16] <movieswithmark> Baby Driver for sure. 

[22:16] Abutter_my_bread> wild* 

[22:17] <butter_my_bread> Dsp is a deadeye dood 

[22:17] <movieswithmark> #1 is without question The Florida Project. 

[22:17] <mickjones90> Don’t Breathe is a good horror movie if you haven't seen it 

[22:17] <pcgamehunter> Elliot "Why don’t you understand!?" What I see -> 1 "Shut up Elliot" 2 "Shut up Elliot" 
3 "Quit game" 

[22:17] <jordanvizer> what are you doing 
[22:17] <jordanvizer> lmfao 

[22:17] <movieswithmark> Willem Dafoe harassing the hell out of a pedophile off his motel property is the best 
scene of the year. 

[22:17] <neospartanhesperos9> @movieswithmark Ohhh, sounds confident. What's the "Florida Project" about? 
CoolStoryBob 

[22:17] <skooma_dealer> @movieswithmark whats the best blaxspoiltation movie i can watch

[22:18] <jordanvizer> DOOD WTF 



[22:18] <movieswithmark> The Florida Project is about lower-class families living out of motels just outside 
Disney World. Willem Dafoe plays the motel manger.
