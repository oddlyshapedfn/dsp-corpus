[19:50] <celestialgoose> Phil, try to change your titles on you tube. 

[19:50] <bentboxer> the new miss universe is from south africa and she is SMOKIN! 

[19:50] <celestialgoose> They usually demonetize titles 
[19:50] <breath321> I like drama though :) 

[19:50] <plizzat5> CoolStoryBob 
[19:50] <thebigtjl337> #SusanSux 

[19:51] <popsicolo> Elsagate is a disturbing thing on Youtube where it's videos of children’s characters doing 
nasty shit to freak out children @haikugay 
[19:51] <popsicolo> and they still get ads. 

[19:51] <jannedaarcl35> ugh 
[19:51] <tetsujin23> Sup bitch 

[19:51] <haikugay> @Popsicolo lol what the actual fuck 

[19:51] <popsicolo> That's only scratching the surface too NotLikeThis 

[19:51] <kinggoken> lrnao 

[19:52] <haikugay> The internet was a mistake 

[19:52] <thebigtj 1337> advertising is worthless for the most part anyways 

[19:52] <popsicolo> You name your freaky videos after kid friendly stuff and you can still get ads. 

[19:52] <tetsujin23> Fap 

[19:52] <plizzat5> never seen 1 pewdiepie videp 
[19:52] <bentboxer> al gore what have you done?!!!!!

[19:52] <jannedaarcl35> Yeah I have noticed that 

[19:52] <thatanonybear> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWgPw7QfwxU 
[19:52] <breath321> So might as well just re-enable comments? Or nah? 

[19:53] <butter_my_bread> There’s bad ppl everywhere, it's the internet n YT is an open forum until they 

blacklist words which they may do 
[19:53] <popsicolo> BEAR 
[19:53] <thatanonybear> :o 
[19:53] <plizzat5> toxic environment 
[19:53] <popsicolo> NotLikeThis 

[19:53] <popsicolo> Spider-Man scat porn. Y'know, for kids! KappaHD 
[19:53] <leannaburnell> Phil is it too late for us? 

[19:53] <celestialgoose> DSP try VidMe 
[19:54] <celestialgoose> I'm not saying move there 

[19:54] <jannedaarcl35> I hope need for speed is in the worst game of the year category 

[19:54] <thatanonybear> popsi pis NotLikeThis that one's not that bad 

[19:54] <celestialgoose> Just whatever that u post on you tube 

[19:54] <celestialgoose> Post the same at Vidme as well 

[19:54] <celestialgoose> It might help and have new fans from that site. 

[19:54] <thebigtj 1337> it would probably take way too long to upload 

[19:54] <butter_my_bread> nobody watches live tv and on demand doesn’t have alot of ads so advertisers will 

come crawling back or have to figure out an alternative way to sell products to the masses, there's no way 
[19:54] <jerryharper> That's cool. 

[19:54] <haikugay> senpai loves us 
[19:54] <nolbert87> that sounds best 
[19:54] <celestialgoose> He can try 

[19:54] <zahvone> @DarksydePhil how's it going man? How's the headset? 




[19:54] <yolodopper> cheerlO i think youtube wouldve been much better if they had management managing thr 
business and not being sjw actvists 

[19:55] <breath321> I honestly doubt there's a huge market for new Need for Speed games, like for Madden and 
COD, casuals are all over that, but are there any dedicated NFS fans? 

[19:55] <thebigtjl337> no lol 

[19:55] <breath321> Personally I haven’t played a NSF game since Underground 2 
[19:55] <breath321> NFS even 

[19:55] <drilbit777> I got skyrim switch for only 33 bucks :0 
[19:55] <plizzat5> you tube blows 
[19:55] <cinochino> Oh more utube talk 

[19:55] <celestialgoose> @DarksydePhil Upload the same video from you tube, on Vidme, this should help, you 
might grow there as well. 

[19:56] <zahvone> Glad you enjoy it man. Glad to be back though lol 

[19:56] <celestialgoose> You do not need to move to vidme, just have ur vids uploaded there, additionally.

some grime or garage for the british urban bloke 
[20:47] <cresstheangel> mini van vs pickup truck? 

[20:47] <vashon91> bugged design mechanics

[20:47] <nep_pudding> Phil, put tofu in your trunk. That will give your car the extra power it needs. 

[20:47] <clunkyd> arcade racer, arcade physics.

[20:49] <thedanielmax> A choke with this kind of lead should require uninstalling the game and calling it a day. 

[20:49] <thatanonybear> like the convicts in Dead Rising 

[20:49] <drptolemy> its a casual player game 

[20:49] <pinkdam> yeah that's ameribeat 

[20:49] <montiblanc> oops

[20:49] <lichbreed> maybe its scripted and she will appear at some point 

[20:49] <ahungryrobot> no, that just happens sometimes, the lvl races aren't very hard 

[20:50] <chmf030> Time for the ultimate rubber band.

[20:51] <jannedaarcl35> RIP Faith 

[20:51] <kekon3> she died and Mac is pretending she’s still alive 

[20:51] <elcspx> she’s ordering her giant complicated drink at Starbucks right now, phil won 



[20:51] <nep_pudding> "The Raptor disappeared!?" "It can't be!"

[20:52] <superslygaming> PogChamp diablo 

[20:52] <jannedaarcl35> The car vanished...or was it never there to begin with? 

[20:52] <mose2118> Cars in Phils garage 

[20:52] <thexman29> hey phil future reference you still want to upgrade your car instead of hoping to wreck 

them it would be a easier game 

[20:52] <superbatcat> it was all a dream 

[20:53] <vashon91> No, its a Faguar D Type 

[20:53] <clunkyd> Breath, are u serious? lol 

[20:53] <baylesstheg0> those headphones seem to be working 

[20:53] <breath321> @clunkyd I mean, if he doesn’t want to there's no need, but that win wasn’t legit since Faith 
glitched out 

[20:53] <jannedaarcl35> And that was the end of faith jones 
[20:53] <clunkyd> XD 

[20:53] <katexo234> phil got a lambo dspSurpriseddsp 
[20:53] <myathebeez> Nah fuck Faith Jones. 

[20:53] <pinkdam> why say she glitched and not phil raced properly so she never caught back up? 

[20:54] <jannedaarcl35> The next mission is to bury faith jones 

[20:54] <mr5twitch> @breath321 she didna€™t glitch she met a much bigger tragedy 

[20:54] <nep_pudding> This next mission is gonna be fun to watch 

[20:54] <haikugay> @Pinkdam be no one has ever said "phil raced properly" 

[20:54] <breath321> @Pinkdam She wasn't anywhere to be seen ever, she never ever made it back close to Phil, 
so that leads me to believe it was glithced 

[20:54] <breath321> either that or she just crashed herself over and over again 
[20:54] <plizzat5> CarlSmile 

[20:54] <katexo234> @popsicolo its party time TPFufun 
[20:54] <vashon91> get a faster car already 

[20:54] <pinkdam> looks more like phil finally did the race without crashing and faith did her usual crash and 
that let phil win 

[20:54] <thatindieglo> You were on events not all in the map 

[20:54] <pinkdam> I bet faith would have caught up if phil wrecked a couple times like his previous tries 

[20:54] <superslygaming> PogChamp buy lambo 

[20:55] <breath321> Yeah maybe 

[20:55] <nep_pudding> Filter the map

HELL. 

[20:55] <pinkdam> unless phil crashed faith only caught up on the straightaway 
[20:55] <superbatcat> You have to do a mini review after finshing this game phil 
[20:55] <popsicolo> Not everyone that lives in Nevada is from Nevada, Phil. CarlSmile 

[20:55] <suckasurprise> Is Phil going to do any of the multiplayer for this game or is he just gonna finish off the 
single player mode and be done with it? 

[20:56] <thexman29> u were in events not all go back u can fast travel 

[20:56] <breath321> @suckasurprise if he thinks the AI cheats, to him everyone in multiplayer will be cheating

[21:57] <i_came_here_to_something> 3S has to be one of the worst fighting games I've ever played tbh 
[21:57] <paddingtonbearl87> if he could he would throw the disk but he downloaded the game so whats he 
gonna do throw the hard drive? InuyoFace 

[21:57] <majinboo3> 3rd strike is actually one of the better street fighters 
[21:57] <majinboo3> because you actually need to be good to play it 
[21:57] <myathebeez> Yay 
[21:57] <tha_enigma> LUL 

[21:57] <i_came_here_to_something> That's not saying much; and you only need to know how to abuse the tiers 

and parry mechanics, not much skill in doing either 

[21:58] <kingofhypocrisy> I'm going faster now .... ^crashes* 

[21:58] <eldeadmariachi> C'mon Darksy you can do it BlessRNG 
[21:58] <tha_enigma> "abuse tiers" 

[21:58] <majinboo3> i can tell you are not a fighting game palyer you probably play smash LOL 
[21:58] <tha_enigma> wew 
[21:58] <dolladalabill> PogChamp 

[21:58] <i_came_here_to_something> No. i literally was just playing 3S minutes ago. But I've felt that way 
about the game for years now. The more you play it the more its flaws become apparent. 

[21:58] <kingofhypocrisy> where are the cops dood

[21:59] <mickjones90> your car is way too underpowered 

[21:59] <slipperysteve83> cheer50 fuck this game

[21:59] <arnity> Exactly

[22:00] <kingofhypocrisy> LUL 

[22:00] <youngcud> No weapons formed against me shall prosper 
[22:00] <drptolemy> so strange your so goooooooooooooood 
[22:00] <lil_summrs> you dont need a faster car 

[22:00] <suckasurprise> Is there some reason he doesn’t want to buy another car? 

[22:00] <dimitri25> What car do you own IRL? 

[22:00] <breath321> the irony 

[22:00] <dolladalabill> beat this game without ever spending any money LUL 

[22:00] <i_came_here_to_something> SFV is a much more balanced game in terms of the tiers. If they could just 
fix the input delay (that's an Unreal engine issue btw), and some of the Crush Counters and V-Triggers, it'd be 
miles ahead of 3S 

[22:00] <shoshone> not your fault huh? 

[22:00] <paddingtonbearl87> xecRIP 
[22:00] <majinboo3> Uninstall this shit 

[22:00] <majestic_seven> Playing the game in their intended way is bs? LUL 



[22:00] <myathebeez> Ended in a beautiful note lol 
[22:00] <musclesforbones> so did you enjoy it? Kappa 
[22:00] <whiterowie> nothing you could do 
[22:00] <drptolemy> your not fine 
[22:00] <jannedaarcl35> Good stream Phil 
[22:00] <breath321> Nothing you could do 
[22:00] <majestic_seven> You wona€™t delete it Kappa 
[22:00] <skyruxdrakeo> So this is your favorite game right? 

[22:00] <saint272> you suck 
[22:00] <myathebeez> Gotta love lootboxes 
[22:00] <breath321> garbage game 
[22:00] <paddingtonbearl87> xecT 
[22:00] <chmf030> Go for drag 
[22:00] <skyruxdrakeo> 10/10 tho right 

[22:00] <i_came_here_to_something> It's already ahead of 3S in most areas, just not by as big a margin as it 
could be. 

[22:00] <skyruxdrakeo> ???? 

[22:00] <ratchefanl2> you suck saint 
[22:01] <imbadatdota2> i agree phil your right 
[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> SMOKE EM IF you got em 
[22:01] <majinboo3> frozen what? 

[22:01] <suckasurprise> @I_Came_Here_To_Something I agree with you I think SFV gets unreasonable 
amounts of hate 

[22:01] <mose2118> Knew it was gonna be AAAAAAAAhsome 
[22:01] <tha_enigma> "SFV could be better than 3S" 

[22:01] <tha_enigma> lmfao 

[22:01] <breath321> I'm mostly weirded out by the RNG comments Phil is the only person that would ever call 
this RNG, they always wreck him in the same way consistently, by surrounding him or knocking him around, 
how is it random if it happens consistently and intentionally? 

[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> CHILL RACHET 

[22:01] <majinboo3> i didnt even know there was an expansion for that game lol 
[22:01] <drptolemy> cya anyway 

[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> you dont wanna get banned do ya?! InuyoFace LUL 
[22:01] <majestic_seven> Hahaha this shit is dead 
[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> k thx bai 
[22:01] <whiterowie> nn :) 

[22:02] <ratchefanl2> no paddington 
[22:02] <myathebeez> Goodnight all 
[22:02] <tha_enigma> n 
[22:02] <ratchefanl2> lol 
[22:02] <imbadatdota2> bye phil 
[22:02] <paddingtonbearl87> InuyoFace 
[22:02] <jannedaarcl35> Night, guys! 

[22:02] <infamousecondson> good night 

[22:02] <ratchefanl2> i just think phil didnt understand you need to constently get better cars 

[22:02] <paddingtonbearl87> yup 

[22:03] <breath321> Yeah he didn’t get the point 

[22:03] <eldeadmariachi> @ratchefanl2 He doesn't want to grind for new cars 
[22:03] <ratchefanl2> well then thats result aint it 
[22:03] <ratchefanl2> i’d play it the right way just saying 
[22:04] <ratchefanl2> almost tempted to get the game to see if i can do it right 
[22:04] <kozatof> What happened 



[22:04] <kozatof> Did he quit 
[22:05] <mr_izumi> ? 

[22:05] <ratchefanl2> called it a night kozatof 
[22:05] <radiganconagher> do u smoke doinks 
[22:05] <kozatof> Is he gonna play this again 
[22:06] <ratchefanl2> maybe hes gonna decide 

[22:06] <ratchefanl2> but he dosnt understand you need to constently get new cars 

[22:07] <ratchefanl2> got a feeling this may be it 

[22:07] <ratchefanl2> lol he was pissed 

[22:08] <kozatof> He doesna€™t want new cars? 

[22:13] <breath321> Nope, he's trying to play it with the same car 

[22:13] <breath321> without upgrading it whatsoever, so he’s underleveled and with no upgrades 
[22:13] <kozatof> He still has that Benz ? 

[22:14] <breath321> Yeah he's still trying to use it 

[22:14] <breath321> he's basically making the game harder on himself by not upgrading, then complaining about 
how hard it is and how bad the devs are 
[22:15] <kozatof> Lmao 

[22:16] <breath321> I thi nk he just wants an excuse to quit, which is fine, if he doesn't like the game he's not 
forced to play it, but not understanding how it works and complaining about it being badly designed is pretty 
ridiculous 

[22:18] <ratchefanl2> i agree 

[22:18] <ratchefanl2> i may be a mod but i dont agree with phil all the time 
[22:18] <ratchefanl2> this is is a headshaker for sure 

[22:19] <breath321> Like there's no rule that he's supposed to play every game to the ending right? Why is he 

looking for an excuse to quit if he has every right to do so normally 

[22:20] <breath321> it's not like this is a patreon paid playthrough either
