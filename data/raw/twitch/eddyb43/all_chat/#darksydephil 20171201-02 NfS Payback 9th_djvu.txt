[18:46] <burnout26> I am playing NFS Payback Multiplayer and there is a 
gamertag called PewdiepieFan 
[18:50] <jannedaarcl35> oh no >.< 

[18:59] <jannedaarcl35> Jin owns is OWNING this match 
[19:29] <darksydephil> wasaaaap 

[19:29] <darksydephil> gonna start the stream in a sec 

[19:31] <burnout26> Just got done playing some Payback grinding to get 
money to buy more cars. 

[19:31] <suckasurprise> Hey guys 

[19:32] <majinboo3> how will the supernova cheat in todays stream\ 

[19:32] <flyeaglesfly01> I went to Game to buy Payback today and it was 
Â£52 LUL No chance I am paying that 

[19:32] <majinboo3> with the car that has the speed force in it 
[19:32] <burnout26> I remember beating her with a porsche 
[19:32] <darksydephil> why on earth would you buy Payback lol 
[19:32] <darksydephil> the game is horrid 

[19:32] <suckasurprise> Did Phil win the race against the streamer girl 
character last night? 

[19:33] <majinboo3> Even if you torrent payback it would be a waste of 
bandwith 

[19:33] <majinboo3> would literally be the defintion of waste of space 

[19:33] <majinboo3> He cant sucka 

[19:33] <majinboo3> she straight up goes lk mph 

[19:33] <flyeaglesfly01> @DarksydePhil lol It seems terrible but in a fun 
sort of way LUL And I love cars 



[19:33] <majinboo3> she breaks the sound barrier 

[19:34] <burnout26> I like to customize the cars. Multiplayer is awful. 
Everyone just wrecks u to pass. 

[19:34] <majinboo3> LOL 

[19:34] <flyeaglesfly01> @DarksydePhil And watching you play it made me 
want a racing game but there is ZERO good racing games for PS4. 

[19:35] <thatanonybear> the other NFS games arent as bad 
[19:35] <majinboo3> the runs was pretty bad 

[19:35] <flyeaglesfly01> @ThatAnonyBear The old Most Wanted is the best 
by far 

[19:35] <burnout26> Now the question is Is DSP getting The Crew 2 when it 
comes out in March 

[19:35] <majinboo3> he said he was semi interested 

[19:35] <suckasurprise> @DarksydePhil Before you start racing again 
tonight you should customize your license plate, it might give you some 
luck 

[19:35] <majinboo3> because its not just straight up car racing 
[19:36] <thatanonybear> @FlyEaglesFly01 i cant remember if i played that 
one, but PS2 as a gr8 era for NFS 

[19:36] <thatanonybear> change the license plate to NAGITO 
[19:36] <burnout26> Underground 2 Best NFS Game 
[19:36] <darksydephil> okay kekon's match is over 
[19:36] <darksydephil> time to start streaming 

[19:36] <jannedaarcl35> YESS, we need the license plate to read Nagito

[19:42] <lieutenantworf > is this a whistle solo?

repetitive. Just giving you honest advice. I give you positive props when 
you do good and give you criticism when it's legit. It's annoying, and 
most people would agree.

[21:40] <thatindieglo> Wrong use the e brake with drag cars lol 
[21:40] <eldeadmariachi> @forest_reviews Yea those too are good I meant 
the last two NFS that I really enjoyed 
[21:40] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[21:41] <renjessejames> Ok, maybe you do need the handbrake in this game. 

Ii'm used to Forza physics 

[21:41] <the_elusiveone45> 10/10 -IGN 

[21:41] <pinkdam> is the e brake the handbrake or ? 

[21:41] <convertedclone> "Avoid collisions" Kappa 
[21:41] <renjessejames> Or brake earlier perhaps 
[21:41] <jannedaarcl35> Nice 

[21:41] <infinite_55> Did IGN really give this game a 10/10? 

[21:41] <poopshortsjr> e brake = handbrake = parking brake 
[21:41] <211trill> 6/10 too much road 

[21:41] <djrunol> @renjessejames you do need it in 90Â° turns, but the 

thing was that phil uses it at every turn

[21:45] <infamousecondson> what game will you play next? 

[21:45] <the_elusiveone45> Phil why are you torturing yourself yourself 
by playing this monstrocity? 

[21:45] <sanvilla93> he is at 95.99% of rage quitting and unistalling it 
[21:45] <gojirakunpls> destroy all those cars 
[21:45] <sanvilla93> we almost there guys 



[21:45] <gojirakunpls> yes, send them flying 

[21:45] <forest_reviews> Phil with this car you need to let up off the 
gas a bit as you are driving it. it does not control well in tight turns 
so let it flow into the turns and give it time 

[21:46] <convertedclone> probably not a good idea to use the handbrake 
there NotLikeThis 

[21:46] <slipperysteve83> cheer70 what's up Phil? This game still blows. 

[21:46] <goldencolts> LUL 

[21:46] <the_elusiveone45> LMFAO

[21:46] <6th_moral> that was epic 

[21:46] <orangewatermelon> why would they put rocks into a drag race man 
[21:46] <convertedclone> every time he uses the handbrake take a shot 
[21:47] <eldeadmariachi> BrokeBack "EA Dumb fucks" 

[21:47] <takumibun> back to 4th 
[21:47] <convertedclone> ... 

[21:47] <taniaraven> use the Force Phil, let go 
[21:47] <sanvilla93> gotta buy those lootboxes 

[21:47] <forest_reviews> @DarksydePhil just put it on easy if you need 
to. We all understand and besided you are almost at the end of the story 
anyways 

[21:48] <tengu_stoner> Car level doesn't mean shit when you suck at 
driving 

[21:48] <goldencolts> you just have to let out the accelerator major 
before turns 

[21:48] <bethefueg> U got the stats., now u need the skill 
[21:48] <goldencolts> the car has bad brakes for how fast it is 
[21:48] kneospartanhesperos9> there's actually a guy in this chatroom 
named 'orangewatermelon' ,wtf 

[21:48] <pinkdam> try to stay on the road 
[21:48] <6th_moral> lmao 

[21:48] <poopshortsjr> How gotta manage your acceleration better. 

[21:48] <taniaraven> why are you doing a regular race in a drag car? 
[21:48] <the_elusiveone45> "Give us your money, for a chance to win some 
good prizes to improve your gameplay! Lootboxes are the future of

[21:48] <super_slade> should have gottten the VW Bug 

[21:48] <6th_moral> Hey Phil have you tried not driving into cars? 

[21:48] kneospartanhesperos9> lol 

[21:49] <convertedclone> I think this race needs more finesse, not raw 
power. You'll probably do just as well going 70% the speed 
[21:49] kneospartanhesperos9> WTF 
[21:49] <the_elusiveone45> NFS franchise is dead 

[21:49] <infamousecondson> @DarksydePhil what game are you playing next? 
[21:49] <spergmcburg> stop turning at full speed you dipshit 
[21:49] <the_elusiveone45> Just raqequit this shit already 
[21:49] <eldeadmariachi> Lower the speed of your car and improve the 
handling 



[21:49] <poopshortsjr> Don't press the gas pedal until the car is 
straight. 

[21:49] <taniaraven> get a better car 

[21:49] <zhardjinn> Need to adjust for acceleration and tune downforce 
more to heavy 

[21:49] <comebackkid232> Do you the definition of insanity 
[21:49] <pinkdam> remember, slow in,fast out 
[21:49] <nitrozeus2000> Rage 

[21:49] <takumibun> @DarksydePhil what would you rate this game? 

[21:49] <super_slade> Ghost Gamers needs an all-female reboot 

[21:49] <the_elusiveone45> Game sucks thats why 

[21:50] <convertedclone> ...by crashing into a rock 

[21:50] <the_elusiveone45> also, came out in a terrible time 

[21:50] <forest_reviews> try not to speed during sharp turns, cars in 

realy life cannot be controlled like that 

[21:50] <popsicolo> The best part of this game is the ending where it's 
revealed Tyler died at the beginning and this is his personal Hell. 

[21:50] <chmf030> @DarksydePhil They pretty much gave you a shotgun for a 
sniper mission. 

[21:50] <neospartanhesperos9> @ThatAnonyBear Hey i asked a while ago but 
left before i could see anyone respond so i'll ask again- did phil defeat 
Nova 

[21:50] <popsicolo> "Stank troll" -Tyler 
[21:50] <6th_moral> ive been watching since 1968 

[21:50] <eldeadmariachi> @chmf030 You can Kill the End with a Shotgun on 
MGS3 lol 

[21:50] <the_elusiveone45> Wait, Phil is going to replay MGS2 and 3? LMAO 
this should be interesting. 

[21:50] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 He did 

[21:50] <convertedclone> actually it's more like they gave him a sniper 
for a CQC mission 

[21:51] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 oh yeah he beat Nova 
[21:51] <spergmcburg> you consistently hit the wall of that turn at full 
speed, no idea why you wont change your way of playing instead of whining 
about the game 

[21:51] <popsicolo> I've been watching Phil since the heat death of the 
previous universe.
