Session Ident: #darksydephil 

[19:04] <darksydephil> you can’t time someone out for 3 hours from wha ti know of twitch chat FYI 
[19:05] <lightkunl988> @DarksydePhil which char will you try today? 

[19:16] <darksydephil> i dunno, the control scheme is very odd lol 
[19:18] <kekon3> make sure it's set to classic 
[19:18] <darksydephil> oh shit, you can change it? lol 

[19:18] <kekon3> thats just standard 6 button fighter then, if not then you input specials like command normals 
[19:18] <kekon3> it's weird 

[19:19] <darksydephil> where is this classic option? 

[19:19] <kekon3> when you're setting your color/Gougi there's also Classic or Progressive 

[19:19] <kekon3> progressive is Simple moode 

[19:19] <darksydephil> how do you do training mode with classic? 

[19:20] <darksydephil> lh there it is lol 

[19:20] <lightkunl988> its onthe char select screen 

[19:20] <darksydephil> holy fuck i was wondering how they changed it so oddly 
[19:20] <kekon3> ye, odd af 

[19:20] <majinboo3> i wonder if this game will play like street lighter EX? 

[19:20] <kekon3> I think you'd like Garuda/Darun btw 
[19:20] <lightkunl988> only the throws are a little off iirc 
[19:21] <suckasurprise> Hey all 

[19:22] <kekon3> Kairi is just Not Ryu, Allen is Not Ken, Garuda is your other mid range character, and 

Skull-o-mania is your high flyer 

[19:22] <kekon3> Damn is literally Zangief 

[19:22] <darksydephil> damn i wish Damn's throws were better, i could see some sick ass setups 
[19:22] <darksydephil> he was better in EX lol 

[19:23] <kekon3> yeah, they took out a bunch of moves oddly, Damn don’t got his "G.O.D." 

[19:23] <bentboxer> just came back from watching the last jedi... IT STUNK 
[19:23] <kekon3> really @bentboxer I thought it was awesome 
[19:23] <darksydephil> holy fuck! 

[19:23] <bentboxer> what did you like about it 
[19:23] <bentboxer> kekon3 

[19:23] <darksydephil> damns SPD range is insane with light attacks hahahaha 

[19:24] <suckasurprise> I haven't played this game yet but I've heard some people say the EX series was super 

garbage and some people say it was awesome so I'm not really sure what to expect 

[19:24] <kekon3> @bentboxer visuals, direction, tone, character driving, to put it simply 

[19:24] <bentboxer> ah well glad you enjoyed it 

[19:24] <kekon3> oh, were those the things you didn’t like BibleThump 

[19:25] <kekon3> EX series had some really fun ideas that I think they never got to go all in on, and some really 
odd engine quirks 

[19:25] <bentboxer> everything i dislike is spoilery so im not going to say 

[19:25] <kekon3> oh, well I thought all the spoilery stuff was neat, I know exactly why people are upset but 
thinking about it, it kinda excites me 

[19:27] <kekon3> what sold the movie visually was that one shot in space near the 3rd, the moment when the 
movie goes silent. I think you should know which moment I'm talkin about 
[19:27] <leonaras> Hi fullhands asmoHug 

[19:27] <kekon3> like, hella beautiful and striking in a way movies don’t get to be without burning money 

[19:28] <jannedaarcl35> Inagito 

[19:28] <nightbot> #HopeSeedPhil #NudeForNagito 

[19:28] <darksydephil> Kairi seems damn good 

[19:28] <darksydephil> midair cancels and air super combos 



[19:28] <jannedaarcl35> Yesss, I am in time 

[19:29] <kekon3> he's a good ryu, cHP is a good anti air, his fireball is annoying, good speed, benefits off p 

much all the gougi 

[19:29] <thatanonyraccoon> Inagito 

[19:29] <nightbot> #HopeSeedPhil #NudeForNagito 

[19:29] <kekon3> Lemine just let you know rn, @DarksydePhil what I meant by a growing meta was that the 
tier list for Gougi got figured out like day 2 
[19:30] <jannedaarcl35> #NudeForNagito 

[19:30] <kekon3> that and people learned your hitstun is increased in the skid of a dash, so links are easier if you 

do forward forward beforehand 

[19:31] <thatanonyraccoon> yeah, what kekon said 

[19:31] <thatanonyraccoon> forward forward 

[19:32] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea wtf these gougi are 

[19:32] <kekon3> think oif them like the SFxT gems but uhh, not as annoying to manage 
[19:33] <kekon3> they're more like CvS grooves tbh 
[19:34] <darksydephil> wow 

[19:34] <darksydephil> I named a video "Amaterasu Drops the Bomb" and it got demonetized 
[19:34] <darksydephil> the algorithm is like, coded by a 5 year old 
[19:35] <kekon3> lmao 

[19:36] <kekon3> but yeah @suckasurprise EX and Fighting layer games were hella fun for one reason, you can 
cancel supers into other supers 

[19:36] <jannedaarcl35> Damn, it sucks I missed Okami HD stream today :( 

[19:36] <darksydephil> yeh you can cancel a special into a super and sometimes into another super, its dope 

[19:36] <darksydephil> blanka was insanely OP because of it 

[19:36] <thatanonyraccoon> yes @JanneDaArcl35 a thrill ride for the ages 

[19:36] <kozatof> Who timed me out for 3 hours

[19:39] <jannedaarcl35> LOL 

[19:39] <jannedaarcl35> I tried to give myself a timeout :p 
[19:39] <darksydephil> okay lets get this started, this should be fun 
[19:39] <kozatof> Timeouts should be 300 seconds not 12000 

[19:40] <kozatof> @darksydephil are you playing pubg on this stream? Or something after 
[19:40] <kekon3> It was me, thought you were being p rude to leonaras tbh 
[19:41] <kekon3> in kind of an uncalled for way? 

[19:41] <kozatof> Well there was only 2 mods my man 
[19:41] <kozatof> It wasna€™t bethe and it wasna€™t you

[20:01] <clowndave> Hi there Phil !!!! 

[20:01] <kinggoken> this game may end up getting more viewers than Okami 
[20:02] <4inchfil> What did he say on Twitter? 

[20:02] <smackhammerl> he really does need a "why am i toxic" notification sound. 

[20:02] <smackhammerl> that would be godly 

[20:02] <skumbag_horse> its a meme 

[20:02] <reggieface420> its just you shouting why am i toxic

[20:05] <i_came_here_to_something> Least he's not on a 4K TV. They have to adjust some settings to get it 
displaying correctly on 4K TVs. 

[20:05] <thatanonyraccoon> taxes on drugs dspEw 

[20:05] <skooma_dealer> I also pay taxes on our time together in the sack and in my sack 
[20:05] <4inchfil> is this whole game a street fight ripoff 
[20:06] <thatanonyraccoon> who taxes Skooma? 

[20:06] <skooma_dealer> ;) 

[20:06] <skumbag_horse> ATO allows payment plans, doesnt compel one off payments. IRS is similar but more 
forcefully, Washington state would have even less power 
[20:06] <katastrophe> lmao 

[20:06] <skooma_dealer> i tax it by adding a markup 
[20:06] <kushiyakitori> LUL rip off games are amazing 
[20:06] <i_came_here_to_something> It's an anti-air 
[20:06] <4inchfil> these hitboxes are crap 

[20:06] <kushiyakitori> play that smash rip off on ps4 @DarksydePhil 
[20:06] <skumbag_horse> i know most about ATO but its an educated guess 
[20:06] <skooma_dealer> nony i will tax you in bed 
[20:06] <paddingtonbearl87> JUS GOT a ps4 PRO BOOIIIz InuyoFace 
[20:06] <reggieface420> well this is surely going to be a good game 
[20:06] <4inchfil> lol skooma 



[20:06] <paddingtonbearl87> xecBAG

[20:12] <kushiyakitori> this guy has an awful character model 
[20:12] <4inchfil> Phil knows a lot about fighting games wow 
[20:12] <zahvone> The lack of aliasing hurts. 

[20:12] <i_came_here_to_something> Name's obviously referring to a tooth filling @kozatof, which is a really 

deep tooth filling tbh 

[20:12] <skooma_dealer> exactly 

[20:12] <kingofhypocrisy> @AfroCole Did Phil ever lose a money match to you? 

[20:12] <kozatof> Ooooh youa€™re right

[20:13] <skooma_dealer> asians love him 

[20:13] <dweebenheimer20> @Zahvone yeah it looked really fuzzy/blurry when i tried it 
[20:13] <afrocole> he has a really good Blanka and DJ in Super Turbo Street Fighter 
[20:13] <zahvone> Someone tip 10 bits to get Phil to recognize this man. 

[20:13] <4inchfil> He goes to Japan a lot? 

[20:13] <shartlybartly> who here likes suckin on chun li's toes 

[20:13] <zahvone> @dweebenheimer20 I wonder if they'll keep it like that? 

[20:13] <kozatof> @shartlybartly why not juri 

[20:13] <kushiyakitori> @Zahvone but phil hasn't seen the previous cheers so I don't think it will matter at this 
point

[20:16] <dweebenheimer20> try it in reverse, melee super, then launch super 

[20:16] <zahvone> @AfroCole Honestly you might want to tweet him or something. He's doing a video right 
now, I believe. 

[20:16] <thatanonyraccoon> @kozatof because once his genius flows, we need to have some insight into the 
complexities of his technique

[20:19] <zahvone> That strap tryna come through like a third arm smh 

[20:19] <afrocole> actually cool to know Phil got some chill stream watchers. Most streamers are so toxic 

[20:19] <afrocole> i mean the chat 

[20:19] <4inchfil> Phil like is never this informative 

[20:19] <dweebenheimer20> @Kinggoken its a really old school lighter, very fundamental-based, im guessing 
thats why 

[20:19] <zahvone> @AfroCole We have some bad apples, don’t worry about that. Lol 
[20:19] <smackhammerl> inb4 salt 

[20:20] <kingofhypocrisy> @AfroCole Why are they toxic? 

[20:20] <wubegg> Pretty self explanatory 
[20:20] <4inchfil> I like apples 

[20:20] <thatanonyraccoon> @AfroCole i've seen streamers where the whole chat is racial slurs 

[20:20] <afrocole> @4inchFil yeah , he really knows this game lol we played it SOOO much back in the day. Its 

like nastalgia right now for Phil 

[20:20] <elite878> Online 5Y™(E 

[20:20] <kinggoken> lol @smackhammerl 

[20:20] <manyperegrine81> So guys tell me more about this fighting game. It got the aesthetics of capcom 
[20:20] <kushiyakitori> can we get some info on that top cheer? im curious 
[20:20] <thatanonyraccoon> just the N word up and down 
[20:20] <thatanonyraccoon> at least DSP isnt that bad 

[20:20] <4inchfil> @AfroCole when did this game first become available to play? 

[20:20] <manyperegrine81> Ia€™m liked the music of it though. 

[20:20] <afrocole> @ThatAnonyRaccoon i know its rediculous, this is why its so refreshing to be here 
[20:20] <kozatof> @kingofhypocrisy I remember you 



[20:20] <kinggoken> this is gonna be good 
[20:20] <afrocole> PHIL!!! 

[20:20] <flyeaglesfly01> @KushiYakitori He's slavering shite 
[20:20] <torgles> salt 

[20:20] <jahabasedgodd> Why the N word? How do you know cole is black? 

[20:20] <torgles> SALT 

[20:20] <kushiyakitori> @ManyPeregrine81 the first game in the series is from like 19 years ago. pretty old 
school kind of game 

[20:20] <bausleyfred> is this his first match 

[20:20] <dweebenheimer20> You can search for an opponent while in training 
[20:20] <afrocole> yeah nearly 20 years ago! 

[20:20] <smackhammerl> whos the publisher? 

[20:20] <4inchfil> 20 years ago? 

[20:20] <afrocole> dang maybe Phil will read the chat =D 

[20:20] <i_came_here_to_something> Oh he's already looking for a match? That was fast LUL 
[20:20] <kushiyakitori> @FlyEaglesFly01 slavering? 

[20:20] <skumbag_horse> time to stream snipe? 

[20:21] <thatanonyraccoon> @JaHaBASEDGODD huh? i mean I've seen chats where the whole chat is the N 
word, nothing else 

[20:21] <flyeaglesfly01> @KushiYakitori Google it lol 
[20:21] <afrocole> LOL 

[20:21] <zahvone> He might not recognize the name o_o 
[20:21] <flamingclaw> How's things tonight Phil? 

[20:21] <4inchfil> here we go! 

[20:21] <dweebenheimer20> @smackhammerl great question, my guess is sony? 

[20:21] <kekon3> Juggernaut gives you infinite super armor (after getting knocked down 10 times) and 
unblockable overhead (after 4 normal overheads) 

[20:21] <afrocole> of course, Damn is already broken 

[20:21] <kingofhypocrisy> @kozatof You're the man from my dreams Kappa 
[20:21] <paddingtonbearl87> oh GAWSH 
[20:21] <thatanonyraccoon> this is Damn 
[20:21] <kozatof> @flamingclaw hi 

[20:21] <flyeaglesfly01> @KushiYakitori Basically I mean he's talking shite 
[20:21] <fluttershyl970> i hear this game has some lag 
[20:21] <manyperegrine81> @kushiyakitori Looks like it. 

[20:21] <4inchfil> guess Phil is a little msty 
[20:21] <kinggoken> dang 
[20:21] <dweebenheimer20> LUL 
[20:21] <torgles> LOL 

[20:21] <kushiyakitori> @LlyEaglesFly01 ah just googled, lol. never heard that term before, interesting 

[20:21] <kingofhypocrisy> Rekt 

[20:21] <rpgasm38> r-r-rekt 

[20:21] <solid_fantasy> You'll kick ass Phil 

[20:21] <flamingclaw> tfw the alternate costume is wearing black briefs and not grandpa's tighty-whiteys 

[20:21] <wubegg> Netcode is iffy in this beta 

[20:21] <jahabasedgodd> Cole is black are the admins here racist? 

[20:21] <i_came_here_to_something> @JaHaBASEDGODD Dude's just saying how retarded and 
simple-minded some chats can get. I like how Sajam puts it, the "twitch roadies" effect Kappa 
[20:21] <mxavier91> This game looks bad 

[20:21] <kekon3> @fluttershyl970 well... it's running on Unreal 4 unpatched :\ 

[20:21] <flyeaglesfly01> @KushiYakitori Im from the UK.

[21:03] <zahvone> Yeah they haven't finished engineering the audio on Allen. 

[21:03] <manyperegrine81> @skooma_dealer you would probably be charge with allegations 
[21:03] <skooma_dealer> how so? 

[21:03] <4inchfil> She would need proof 

[21:03] <skooma_dealer> I paid her to clean not to fug 

[21:04] <skooma_dealer> fugging just happened 

[21:04] <tehpwncake> oh 

[21:04] <eplegutten> iiyarrrraaah 

[21:04] <skooma_dealer> \o/

[21:04] <4inchfil> \o/ 

[21:04] <kekon3> ggs phil 

[21:04] <zahvone> @Leonaras It's so annoying, It's actually so bad that I keep focusing on it. 

[21:04] <wampaonel> So wait someone messaged me that Phil owns thousands to some chick. Why are they 
messaging me that? 

[21:04] <tehpwncake> Good stuff

[21:04] <easton_taylorl> @darksydephil after the triple larit super, super cancel to belly flop 
[21:05] <skooma_dealer> you mean i cant put her on my tax deductions? 

[21:05] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil Lawyer Claw beat Furball. 

[21:05] <pinkdam> why are you airing your dirty laundry @WampaOnel 
[21:05] <kingofhypocrisy> @WampaOnel What chick? 

[21:05] <skooma_dealer> but its for my drug buisiness 
[21:05] <skooma_dealer> i need to get off 

[21:05] <dukaduka> Huh? I thought the voice was purposefully like that for Allen 
[21:05] <eplegutten> here comes a new challenger 
[21:05] <kushiyakitori> 233 wins? 

[21:05] <kushiyakitori> lol 

[21:05] <wampaonel> I have no idea guys 

[21:05] <torgles> because its true and he is gonna make his "fans" pay for it 
[21:05] <obeychuy89> idiot? 

[21:05] <eplegutten> u can do it phil 
[21:05] <kekon3> ye, I miss old Allen Snider voice 
[21:05] <kingofhypocrisy> look at dis idiot 
[21:05] <dukaduka> 233-11 monkaS 

[21:05] <wampaonel> It's probably nonsense but it's just annoying. 

[21:05] <busymaribo> OrnaMental 
[21:06] <eplegutten> dsp-dsp-dsp 

[21:06] <skooma_dealer> i think i can get away with fucking my maid if i dont ask her for sex in exchange for 
monitary relief 

[21:06] <dukaduka> if he's an idiot, then i’m a fetus monkaS 

[21:06] <howlingwolfjoey> @Kekon3 have u tried the Allen loop that deals almost 100% damage? 

[21:06] <kushiyakitori> 233 wins, might not be "luck" 

[21:06] <skooma_dealer> i will just ask her to clean my cock with her mouth 



[21:06] <eplegutten> hell yeah 

[21:06] <hicredd> Did he already react to that @torgles ? 

[21:06] <manyperegrine81> Dragon tunnel? 

[21:06] <kekon3> @howlingwolfjoey I tried it once in match, but I'm still not good at it lmao 

[21:06] <paddingtonbearl87> i wonder what character hes supposed to be InuyoFace 

[21:06] <4inchfil> @Skooma_Dealer what if the maid is one of those old Spanish abuelas? 

[21:06] <kingofhypocrisy> I was blocking dat 

[21:06] <kekon3> you gotta doubletap forward, sLK cMP sLK cMP special cancel super cancel 

[21:06] <skooma_dealer> No no this maid is hot dood 

[21:06] <manyperegrine81> Chun li definitely 

[21:06] <kekon3> and then from there it's dash loops, too harrrrrd 

[21:06] <pinkdam> you couldn’t get a win rate like that being unsafe surely 

[21:07] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori Well, right now he's not showing that much more than 

Kekon did. He might've gotten a lot of those from playing low-level players 

[21:07] <lightkunl988> This guy is pretty good keep out 

[21:07] <skooma_dealer> shes tight and right and ready for my penis 

[21:07] <goldencolts> holidaycheer250 #charity 

[21:07] <zahvone> ;o 

[21:07] <howlingwolfjoey> @Skooma_Dealer I that Rem? 

[21:07] <howlingwolfjoey> *is 
[21:07] <kekon3> So 

[21:07] <kekon3> Miracle is fucking cancer 

[21:07] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something yeah you could be right about that, the 11 losses might 
be people familiar with the game already, but he seems to have a solid gameplan so far 
[21:07] <skooma_dealer> @howlingwolfjoey huh? 

[21:07] <kekon3> because you get all the good Gougi 
[21:07] <kekon3> all of them 

[21:07] <skooma_dealer> joey you need some skooma fan 
[21:07] <marco0231> outplayed 
[21:07] <eplegutten> nothing we could do 
[21:07] <obeychuy89> unblockable 

[21:07] <kekon3> The lightning effect means it's unblockable 

[21:08] <kingofhypocrisy> Nothing I could do 

[21:08] <dweebenheimer20> hes got Guard Break 

[21:08] <markymark52> Owned 

[21:08] <rosshardie> This guy wins because of hades 

[21:08] <neospartanhesperos9> oh wow,3 rounds required to win? 

[21:08] <howlingwolfjoey> @Skooma_Dealer you mentioned a maid, so im guessing its either rem or ram. 
[21:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori Yeah, he's showing that now. Seems his relies on 
pressuring into a corner. 

[21:08] <skooma_dealer> its REM 

[21:08] <zahvone> This guy, he’s playing to force you on offense, and then corner trap 
[21:08] <skooma_dealer> yum yum give me sum 
[21:08] <dukaduka> that's some nice GOUGI 
[21:08] <wampaonel> Furball!....Furball! 

[21:08] <kekon3> when someone has Hades, literally your only option is to sweep, throw, and super 
[21:08] <eplegutten> Who would win between the evil within Sebastian or leon from re? 

[21:08] <obeychuy89> fuckn netcode dood 

[21:08] <skooma_dealer> I love maids so long as they arent grannies, i have taste 
[21:08] <dweebenheimer20> Phil, those unblocklables are guard breaks 

[21:08] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something yeah since its a beta I'm guessing a lot of players aren’t 
ready for that pressure 




[21:08] <kingofhypocrisy> Bugged Net Code Mechanics 

[21:08] <dweebenheimer20> fom Gougi 

[21:08] <skooma_dealer> I love foreign ones esp 

[21:08] <zahvone> Leon 

[21:09] <kekon3> it's the gougi 

[21:09] <marco0231 > gg 

[21:09] <awildkirby> now he cant block 

[21:09] <kekon3> the gougi makes it busted 

[21:09] <magicjerryfresh 11> Pretty sure it is the guard break boost he has 

[21:09] <skooma_dealer> foreign women are so much nicer than murican broads anyhow 

[21:09] <eplegutten> I want to see wesker fight leon 

[21:09] <manyperegrine81> It wasna€™t stupid the first ten games lol 

[21:09] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori I prob misspoke on the guy earlier just b/c of that one 

combo they were doing earlier ending w/ the fireball that kept missing tbh 

[21:09] <rosshardie> Someone tell Phil you have to jump the guard breaks 

[21:09] <howlingwolfjoey> @Skooma_Dealer i knew it. I want Ricardo as my maid. <3 

[21:09] <fluttershyl970> cheerl5 i am your host the man called ghost lets get to radio graffiti right now 

[21:09] <manyperegrine81> @kingofhypocrisy ita€™s always the Net Code 

[21:10] <bethefueg> hello chatters 

[21:10] <neospartanhesperos9> I want Chris, Leon, and Jacob to have a tea party and talk about politics TPFufun 
[21:10] <kekon3> you're watching someone literally decide to make sure phil doesn't have a good time, thats 
what his setup is 

[21:10] <skooma_dealer> @howlingwolfjoey <3 
[21:10] <bethefueg> what have i missed? 

[21:10] <howlingwolfjoey> Wait... who's Rem? :P 
[21:10] <eplegutten> alot 

[21:10] <skooma_dealer> you missed phil not acting normal tonight 
[21:10] <bethefueg> ??? 

[21:10] <rosshardie> As I said, Damn sucks vs Allen unless you have armor activated 

[21:10] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something thats fair, he did start seemingly playing differently 

after he lost that first round 

[21:10] <bethefueg> oh i see now lol 

[21:10] <4inchfil> Phil's sinuses seem pretty good tonight 

[21:10] <cinochino> Salt flowing 

[21:10] <eplegutten> @Skooma_Dealer : why do my skin on my lips sometimes turn dark blue ? 

[21:10] <i_came_here_to_something> the teabagging doe 
[21:11] <bethefueg> so normal fighting game Phil 
[21:11] <kingofhypocrisy> @fluttershyl970 cans, wav 
[21:11] <thebrokenlegs218> cheer 10 This alien is pretty good 
[21:11] <emry 1 > Guy is just too good for Phil 

[21:11] <skooma_dealer> @Eplegutten its that skooma my dood, just ride it out 

[21:11] <kekon3> he’s smart at least 

[21:11] <lightkunl988> This guy is seriously good :0 

[21:11] <skooma_dealer> means you need warming up 

[21:11] <eplegutten> wtf is skooma ? 

[21:11] <kekon3> he’s making sure to not trip Phil too often so that phil's super armor doesn’t proc 
[21:11] <tacofister> forsenOMEGA 
[21:11] <eplegutten> lol 

[21:11] <skooma_dealer> lips turning blue means you are very cold 
[21:11] <kozatof> Maid? 

[21:11] <obeychuy89> rekt 

[21:11] <skooma_dealer> or lack of oxygen 



[21:11] <dweebenheimer20> its guard break 

[21:11] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori A lot of the higher-skilled players seem to tend to do that 
seems. Basically a way of sandbagging but not really. 

[21:11] <wampaonel> Man these people are weak. I’m being told Phil owes money to a hooker. oooook....how 
would you even come to that conclusion? 

[21:11] <awildkirby> lol 

[21:11] <marblestherabbit> "nothing I could do" 

[21:12] <tacofister> BabyRage never my fault always the game 

[21:12] <eplegutten> damn, its cold in Norway 

[21:12] <kozatof> @skooma_dealer does your maid have red hair 

[21:12] <kingofhypocrisy> TERRIBLE 

[21:12] <neospartanhesperos9> Allen looks dumb. 

[21:12] <kekon3> no phil, with his Gougi, it was actually an unblockable 
[21:12] <manyperegrine81> Here comes the lag 

[21:12] <i_came_here_to_something> these teabags were awesome doe 

[21:12] <rosshardie> This player isnt good, hea€™s just relying on hades and chain combos. And an 8-2 matchup 
[21:12] <darkness_scorpion> online scrub! 

[21:12] <skooma_dealer> My maid wears a red wig but she has blonde hair naturally 
[21:12] <skooma_dealer> she likes to switch it up 

[21:12] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something any idea why? not super familiar with fighting games, 
testing opponent fighting style or just to screw around? 

[21:12] <tehpwncake> Get a woman to get you warm during the cold, even if you have to pay 
[21:12] <bethefueg> this is that SF clone type game right? 

[21:12] <kingofhypocrisy> @Elite878 Are you out in the Arctic like Vidar? 

[21:12] <pray4rock> Those were unblockable 
[21:12] <manyperegrine81> I definitely agree 
[21:12] <obeychuy89> im already blocking 
[21:12] <kozatof> Is she from nether of lands area? 

[21:12] <kekon3> with the right gougi your overhead becomes an unblockable 

[21:12] <vcs77> his gougi makes his overhead unblockable 

[21:12] <skooma_dealer> She is from that area around there 

[21:12] <dweebenheimer20> @BeTheFueg Street fighter EX 

[21:12] <eplegutten> I am in Norway, but its close as fk right now 

[21:13] <eplegutten> cold* 

[21:13] <skooma_dealer> get warm dood! 

[21:13] <eplegutten> lol 

[21:13] <skooma_dealer> you have a fireplace? 

[21:13] <kekon3> the fucked up thing about miracle is that p much all the gougi proc at the same time 
[21:13] <eplegutten> only jews 

[21:13] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil Well, I’m off too bed. Goodnight, Phil. Goodnight, everybody. 

[21:13] <dweebenheimer20> MY unicorn! 

[21:13] <skooma_dealer> goodnight dood 

[21:13] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil's character is huge. 

[21:13] <kozatof> @skooma_dealer I used to date a girl named keanna 
[21:13] <eplegutten> sorry was just joking 

[21:13] <kingofhypocrisy> @Eplegutten You and Vidar should start the Norweigen DSP Fan Club 
[21:13] <skooma_dealer> @kozatofwhat was she like 
[21:13] <eplegutten> haha why? 

[21:14] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori Can be both. If they know their opponent's good but 
don’t know their plan, or are just cautious, they'll just do some stuff to test their answers to it. If they 100% 
sandbag at first but get serious later, they just played dummy to see what the opponent would do (if they know 
combos or setups, etc.). 



[21:14] <kozatof> She was shy, made a weird nose. But she meant well 
[21:14] <kingofhypocrisy> why not? Kappa 
[21:14] <eplegutten> lol 

[21:14] <kozatof> She truly cared about me @skooma_dealer 
[21:14] <skooma_dealer> awwww 
[21:14] <skooma_dealer> did she leave you 
[21:14] <kozatof> Then she left me 
[21:14] <skooma_dealer> oh no! 

[21:14] <skooma_dealer> what happened? 

[21:14] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something interesting, thanks for the info :) 

[21:14] <kingofhypocrisy> she left me for the man in the pickle suit 
[21:14] <skooma_dealer> DAMN FUCKING PICKLE 

[21:15] <kozatof> Yeah we were at the hospital, and I really just didna€™t care about it 
[21:15] <eplegutten> shit pickle? 

[21:15] <kozatof> I wanted to leave 
[21:15] <skooma_dealer> oh shit 

[21:15] <hicredd> @kozatof, did you drain your sorrow in hookers? 

[21:15] <skooma_dealer> yo girls get really sensitive about health matters 
[21:15] <kozatof> I did 
[21:15] <eplegutten> omg 

[21:15] <stratmanl909> didnt someone attack chris chan dressed as a pickle 

[21:15] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori No prob man; I like watching fighting game stuff a lot 
and play 3S so you kind of learn that kind of stuff over time 
[21:15] <neospartanhesperos9> Kozatol 

[21:15] <eplegutten> its the indian tech scammer starting a fighting carear 

[21:15] <aintnosunshinemma> looks like zangief 

[21:15] <neospartanhesperos9> you sound like a bitch 

[21:15] <neospartanhesperos9> TPFufun 

[21:15] <skooma_dealer> I would do rails off of a hookers ass 

[21:16] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 huh 

[21:16] <ichirinkumoi> @StratManl909 who's chris chan 

[21:16] <aintnosunshinemma> We got 4 inches of snow today 

[21:16] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something cool, i dont play fighting games but just check them out 

once in a while or watch some tournaments so i don't know too much 

[21:16] <howlingwolfjoey> neo!!! :) *slaps @NeoSpartanHesperos9 with a trout* 

[21:16] <kozatof> Everyonea€™s having good time @neospartanhesperos9 
[21:16] <dweebenheimer20> what killed him, air? lol 
[21:16] <eplegutten> indian mike hagger from final fight 
[21:16] <kinggoken> hadouken!! 

[21:16] <stratmanl909> @ichirinkumoi a legend 

[21:16] <hicredd> @kozatof please don’t tell me you let them bark for you 
[21:16] <kiinos> this game looks mad fun 

[21:16] <skooma_dealer> i got so depressed one night i ate 3 pounds of meatballs and begged a woman to be my 

gf 

[21:17] <neospartanhesperos9> I agree, we are having a good time. 

[21:17] <aintnosunshinemma> Four inches of snow is a lot 

[21:17] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori That's cool. You still prob know a lot more about them 
than most. 

[21:17] <kinggoken> lol how hasn't this game been shut down by capcom yet 

[21:17] <neospartanhesperos9> I'm just saying though 

[21:17] <eplegutten> let me just say im glad someone are copying capcom 

[21:17] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 Ia€™ll be honest there was a girl I used to know with the name keanna 



[21:18] <kozatof> True and honest 

[21:18] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something maybe lol. still always nice to learn something new 
about these things 

[21:18] <skooma_dealer> how dare you question someone with a crown 

[21:18] <kozatof> Keanna Wu 

[21:18] <skooma_dealer> go sit down somewhere 

[21:18] <neospartanhesperos9> @kozatof what about the hospital part? 

[21:18] <skooma_dealer> people dont go to a hospital 
[21:18] <skooma_dealer> LOL 

[21:18] <rosshardie> @kinggoken because Arika owns all these characters. 2D fighting gameplay moves such as 
DPs and fireballs are not exclusive to Capcom, just the names SRK and Hadoken 
[21:18] <eplegutten> the evil within 2 is art 
[21:18] <skooma_dealer> "ok" 

[21:18] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 she had a cyst, but it turned out to be malignant 
[21:18] <eplegutten> slow motion headshot 

[21:18] <skooma_dealer> people have no money they are spending it on family 
[21:19] <aintnosunshinemma> Four inches of snow is just the Tip of the iceberg 
[21:19] <drilbit777> Would be nice if capcom and Akira collaborated to make SF EX4 
[21:19] <manyperegrine81 > Great stream phil. 

[21:19] <skooma_dealer> Im gonna treat myself to some trim 

[21:19] <neospartanhesperos9> @kozatof and you said you didn’t care to be there? 

[21:19] <kozatof> Oh wait 
[21:19] <ug61ive> go Phil! 

[21:19] <drilbit777> Or at least allow Akira characters in SFV 
[21:19] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 I meant benign 
[21:19] <marblestherabbit> The connection is good 

[21:20] <aintnosunshinemma> A Mario die for Street Fighter would be nice 

[21:20] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 I told her that she was overreacting. In a caring way as possible but 
she still wanted to go 

[21:20] <dweebenheimer20> @Drilbit777 F dat, capcom sucks now LUL 

[21:20] <rosshardie> @drilbit777 yeah it would be nice, but not going to happen, Arika and Capcom havena€™t 
worked together since 2001 (EX 3) 

[21:20] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori True. Sites like Shoryuken and Eventhubs should have 
good articles explaining concepts if you're interested in learning more. Sajam does commentary and he explains a 
lot of stuff really well in his streams, he's analyzing Capcom Cup over the next few days it's worth a peep. 

[21:20] <skooma_dealer> If you beg a woman to be your gf thats not sad is it? 

[21:20] <kozatof> So I went along with it because it was the right thing to do 
[21:20] <skooma_dealer> im getting to the point of begging my ex to come back 
[21:20] <skooma_dealer> tfw single 
[21:20] <xpj627x> LUL 

[21:20] <tehpwncake> Talking of GF, I'll go check on my gf Kimberly. Forgot something important 
[21:20] <dweebenheimer20> sniff dat booty 

[21:21] <aintnosunshinemma> I once paid $100 for a Happy Massage 
[21:21] <skooma_dealer> oh shit you got a happy ending? 

[21:21] <skooma_dealer> how was it 

[21:21] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something thanks, i'll have to check those sites out. i haven’t been 
to eventhubs in a while but never been on shoryuken. i’ll have to look that up and sajam to learn more, appreciate 
the information 

[21:21] <aintnosunshinemma> A happy massage is like a happy meal for adults like us 

[21:21] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 so honestly I didna€™t want to be there cause I told her her cyst 

wasna€™t malignant 

[21:21] <stratmanl909> you coulda gave that 100 to phil Kappa 



[21:21] <bethefueg> he brown nosing like crazy GTChimp 
[21:21] <hicredd> @tehpwncake please pay her, you owe her, man 
[21:21] <goldencolts> holidaycheerl05 #charity 
[21:21] <kozatof> She didna€™t believe me 

[21:21] <cinsolace92> damn definitely eats the booty Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm 
[21:21] <aintnosunshinemma> The Happy Massage gave me the whole package deal 
[21:21] <skooma_dealer> I dont like hearing my ex is happy 
[21:21] <skooma_dealer> im petty af 
[21:22] <kingofhypocrisy> LUL 

[21:22] <skooma_dealer> i wanna ruin her life like she did mine 

[21:22] <i_came_here_to_something> @KushiYakitori You're welcome. Have fun looking around! 

[21:22] <neospartanhesperos9> @kozatof just not meant for each other. TPFufun 
[21:22] <kushiyakitori> @I_Came_Here_To_Something I will :) 

[21:22] <aintnosunshinemma> I like $100 Happy Massages 
[21:22] <kozatof> @neospartanhesperos9 youa€™re right 
[21:22] <skooma_dealer> I need a woman to make her jealous 

[21:22] <tehpwncake> @Hicredd Yeah, I owe her money for some gifts this Xmas. I just gave her half of the 

money, it's for guests 

[21:22] <skooma_dealer> wew 

[21:22] <tehpwncake> need to pay the rest 

[21:22] <drilbit777> @kushiyakitori Go on R Kappa for fighting game stuff TehePelo

[21:30] <dweebenheimer20> you can queue up for matches while in training too 

[21:30] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFlyO 1 Maybe another outside back or center back, I don’t follow the 
team too well anymore. I was last year when Pep moved there but stopped when they started to become 
unstoppable.

[21:30] <flexmastodon> hey phill, are you gonna try learning any other characters during the beta?

[21:32] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 They could win CL again. They could still turn around LaLiga 
no doubt, but I don’t know if they'll focus on it. 

[21:32] <skooma_dealer> murican girls are too shitty 

[21:32] <paddingtonbearl87> skooma u the real mvp dawg do it up and fuck some bitches 

[21:32] <sekander> looks just like Street Fighter V but with anime 

[21:32] <kinggoken> i just saw xavier woods get bodied in Tekken. Hilarious stuff. 

[21:32] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 I don’t think Barca will win next Sunday, and if they do it'll be 
very close. 

[21:33] <capcomdotsystems> @DarksydePhil Are you going to pay your escort? 

[21:33] <skooma_dealer> @paddingtonBEAR187 I will fam I need to treat myself 
[21:33] <kinggoken> lrnao escort? Come on now..

[21:33] <kinggoken> gtab 
[21:33] <4inchfil> what the hell 

[21:33] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 At Real you really need to win everything. Have to focus on 
the League and Champo League. Huge game 
[21:33] <skooma_dealer> no p in v unless its ok 

[21:33] <kingofhypocrisy> Just make sure not to drink and smoke weed at the same time dood or you'll have to 
vomit and shit at the same time ah ah ah ah

[21:34] <kingofhypocrisy> and it costs extra 

[21:34] <paddingtonbearl87> @skooma_dealer SeemsGood 

[21:34] <neospartanhesperos9> @LlyEaglesFlyO 1 Yes, it's a big club like FcB and you must win everything, 
however they could hit a third CL title in a row. Seems like they just hype themselves for CL and don't try as 
hard in LaLiga imo. 

[21:34] <kingofhypocrisy> just like shit and piss 

[21:35] <wint3rmu7e> careful not to grab her ass or youll catch a lawsuit 

[21:35] <skooma_dealer> I respect these women they work hard, harder than a lot of other people 
[21:35] <skooma_dealer> they deserve respect 
[21:35] <niku_cooper> FUCK LOST AGAIN

[21:37] <aintnosunshinemma> Ay dios mio! 

[21:37] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 Just barely. Barcelona beat RM at Bernabeu with no Neymar, 
and then FcB was just 2-3 points away from RM. RM also lost to Celta Vigo in CDR which didn’t make sense to 



me.

[21:42] <aintnosunshinemma> I love Dutch apple strudel 

[21:42] <wint3rmu7e> its like if zangief and the iron shiek did the fusion dance and absorbed ronnie coleman 

[21:42] <pinkdam> apple pie needs custard 

[21:42] <4inchfil> mnan I could go for some strudel 

[21:42] <rosshardie> That player was from Canada no wonder it lagged

[21:43] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 tbh, Neymar leaving was the best thing ever. It seemed bad at 
first because of the adjusting they had to do, but he doesn't seem like Barca material. Too much bitching and 
diving, too much scrappy fighting 

[21:43] <soupysean68> bring back PUBG streams SwiftRage SwiftRage 
[21:43] <eplegutten> lol that animation 

[21:43] <hicredd> @Skooma_Dealer did you pay for the strudel? 

[21:43] <dweebenheimer20> LMAO same guy 

[21:43] <captcaveman4201> i just lost a chicken dinner because pubg glitched out 

[21:44] <aintnosunshinemma> Good thing about happy massages is they are available 24/7 

[21:44] <howlingwolfjoey> Notice me! QAQ *keeps slaping @NeoSpartanHesperos9 with a trout* 

[21:44] <pinkdam> don’t play games while your food is cooking in future lol 

[21:44] <skooma_dealer> Nope! I got that for free luckly but t hen when I went to put my sausage in her strussel 

she rejected me and said I had to pay 100 kroner 

[21:44] <pinkdam> or at least set a physical alarm with a clock 

[21:44] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 I would agree with that. Still a great player but all about him. I 
do think you are missing him a bit atm but if Ousmane can play how he can youse will be sorted there 
[21:44] <4inchfil> 100 kroner for some strussel? That's steep 
[21:44] <skooma_dealer> she had a nice one 
[21:44] <4inchfil> :0 

[21:44] <aintnosunshinemma> @Skooma_Dealer Do you prefer strudel or clams?

play him again

[21:45] <eplegutten> come on dood 

[21:45] <neospartanhesperos9> @FlyEaglesFly01 Ousmane seems great and can provide a lot. He won’t make it 
for Clasico though. It'll probably just be Suarez, Messi, and Paco Alcacer up front. 

[21:45] <skooma_dealer> they could watch me for monies 

[21:45] <kingofhypocrisy> should of paid half up front and half later 

[21:45] <skooma_dealer> :0

[22:19] <eplegutten> circles 

[22:19] <4inchfil> this game looks like it should be free 

[22:19] <aintnosunshinemma> @Hicredd It's hotter than two rats making babies in a sock in the Sahara 

[22:19] <neospartanhesperos9> @theycallmejimbob Who do ManU play this weekend? ;p 

[22:20] <eplegutten> this game looks like 4inches 

[22:20] <eplegutten> :D 

[22:20] <4inchfil> hey! 

[22:20] <4inchfil> 4inches is plenty! 

[22:20] <skelet995> what's with this 4 inch meme?

[22:21] <corey_2293> throws beat 360s in games bruh 

[22:21] <4inchfil> you would think Phil would be used to lag by now 



[22:21] <theycallmejimbob> slideshow hype VoHiYo 
[22:21] <jannedaarcl35> skooma’s two punch champion 

[22:21] <skelet995> will the lag be fixed when this game actually comes out? that's the six thousand dollar 
question 

[22:21] <eplegutten> PogChamp 

[22:21] <skooma_dealer> you know saying retard is offensive, i prefer exceptional individual myself 

[22:21] <neospartanhesperos9> @theycallmejimbob A close to relegation team- Deportivo de Coruna. They lost 

to them last season 1-2 after the PSG comeback dspPepe 

[22:21] <aintnosunshinemma> I like Anderson Silva's UFC music 

[22:22] <skooma_dealer> @JanneDaArcl35 I cum way too fast might be my age fam 

[22:22] <bethefueg> net neutrality will fix lag SeemsGood 

[22:22] <skooma_dealer> I drink a lot of energy drinks too 

[22:22] <4inchfil> This character isn’t very interesting 

[22:22] <neospartanhesperos9> Is Anderson Silva Brazilian? 

[22:22] <skooma_dealer> could effect my cummies 

[22:22] <theycallmejimbob> I'm sure there wont be a repeat of that Neo :D is Dembele out for the season? 
[22:22] <jannedaarcl35> red bull gives you wings though 

[22:22] <aintnosunshinemma> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 He is, he also has an awesome entrance song 
[22:22] <skooma_dealer> yeah but it makes my dick sad 

[22:22] <eplegutten> warner music are some dumb idiots, they took down my videos 

[22:22] <purple_n3rple> Will you play pubg again? It’s nice seeing logical tactics being used compared to the 
aggressive style of doc or shroud. 

[22:22] <eplegutten> so i called them out and they put it back 
[22:22] <jannedaarcl35> sad dick syndrome 

[22:22] <neospartanhesperos9> @AintNoSunshineMMA I knew it, that Silva name is Portugesse dspHmm 
[22:22] <skooma_dealer> exactly! 

[22:22] <skooma_dealer> saddickskooma 

[22:23] <eplegutten> because warner own the music from the game 

[22:23] <aintnosunshinemma> Happy Massage is the only cure for sad dick syndrome 

[22:23] <aintnosunshinemma> :) 

[22:23] <4inchfil> Damn is kind of cheap 

[22:23] <eplegutten> i could not play it online 

[22:23] <eplegutten> and the game was lego the movie 

[22:23] <4inchfil> Damn does too much damage and has too much armor 

[22:23] <neospartanhesperos9> @theycallmejimbob I hope no repeats. Dembele has been training for full 
sessions since last week. Nobody knows when he’ll play. 

[22:23] <jannedaarcl35> he's slow though 

[22:24] <4inchfil> maybe on some of his specials but he seems to keep pace pretty well on the ground 
[22:24] <jannedaarcl35> i do think they should scale some of the damage on his moves 
[22:24] <4inchfil> day shit placeholder voice acting lol 

[22:24] <aintnosunshinemma> Anderson Silva was popped twice for PEDs, so his Pee Pee must be quite small 
[22:24] <omegabusta> These characters look like Chinese boot leg SF characters 
[22:24] <4inchfil> @Omegabusta totally 
[22:25] <jannedaarcl35> poor barry alien >.<
