[19:34] <darthradovanviking> oh yeah. It have actually been quite entertaining so far. IT might be that I am just

unevecer

music starts and i'm like wtf

[19:36] <timboslicegb> oh yrah 

[19:36] <darksydephil> i hope there’s still a stage where you play as Vader, and he spends 20 minutes running 
around collecting items instead of fighting. Kind of like Luke fighting bugs 
[19:36] <timboslicegb> FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ

[19:40] <lickmybussy> JJ isn’t directing The Last Jedi either 



[19:40] <vendatus> Rian Johnson is doing the new Trilogy so obviously Disney liked Last Jedi 
[19:41] <katexo234> TPFufun 

[19:41] <timboslicegb> disney will do their typical destroy franchise by making it run too long 
[19:41] <weaponjay> Lol what is this? 

[19:41] <darksydephil> lol this fucking captain alpacino guy, im so done with him 
[19:41] <donofarms> I think George Lucas did that already 
[19:41] <darthradovanviking> hahha 
[19:41] <darthradovanviking> is that still going on? 

[19:41] <darthradovanviking> @DarksydePhil 
[19:41] <katexo234> who Phil? 

[19:41] <darksydephil> so he's been hounding me multiple times a day to play SW battlefront ii MP with me 
despite the fact ive explained to him 3 times that im not going to do any coop or team MP 
[19:42] <darthradovanviking> the guy that trolled them in the mp zombie thing 

[19:42] <darksydephil> he still thinks he should be able to. so i stopped responding to his stupid emails, and now 
he’s threatened to pull his patron pledge 
[19:42] <kinggoken> wow 

[19:42] <darksydephil> in his THIRD EMAIL to me today, by the way 
[19:42] <katexo234> wow that's crazy 

[19:42] <vendatus> At least JJ gets to finish the Sky walker saga VoHiYo 

[19:42] <darthradovanviking> well if he doesn't give you a million dollars a month fuck it 

[19:42] <timboslicegb> @donofarms the last episode movie was decent and new one looks good im sad to see 

these characters being done after last jedi 

[19:42] <segregate> phil always gets that one annoying guy LUL 

[19:42] <darksydephil> so he thinks that threatening me is going to get him into MP tomorrow, yeah, i dont 

respond well to threats lol 

[19:42] <timboslicegb> john rambo Kreygasm 

[19:43] <valates> I mean, just embarass him if the harassment on his end is that bad. Im sure it's not that bad, just 
pestering, no? 

[19:43] <valates> what came off as a threat? 

[19:43] <donofarms> @timboslicegb I liked it besides its obvious repetition 

[19:43] <darksydephil> he literally just said "i will be pulling my pledge on patreon and no longer supporting 
you unless you have me in MP tomorrow" 

[19:43] <darksydephil> thats a direct threat lol 
[19:43] <rorke47> its ok phil you do you 
[19:43] <suckasurprise> Who said that? 

[19:44] <timboslicegb> um. 

[19:44] <darksydephil> this is after i told him i'm not doing MP with ANYBODY , not just him. he thinks he's 
special and deserves it lol 

[19:44] <timboslicegb> he just wants on your atream phil... 

[19:44] <darksydephil> when you get that kind of behavior, that's when you know to just distance yourself as 
much as you can 

[19:44] <valates> that chiky soundbite sounds familiar. 

[19:44] <darthradovanviking> yeah, agreed @DarksydePhil

[19:46] <popsicolo> I still remember when Phil tried beating that one race of the expert campaign of motorstorm. 
[19:46] <darthradovanviking> Are you remixing with the OBS error thing or is that in the song? 

[19:46] <timboslicegb> sony used motorstorm to sell ps3s at launch.

[19:51] <thesupervillain543> oh ok 

[19:51] <jovayowolu> DSP - any replay value to the campaign? 

[19:51] <renjessejames> A question occurs. What percentage of a patreon donation goes to Phil before taxes? 

Bits are pretty expensive and the 2.9% paypal charges doesn’t seem to bad, but if patreon charges less, that'd be 
nice. 

[19:52] <popsicolo> Land-O-Lakes? KappaHD

[20:02] <succkonlemon> windows 10 fuckd my pc 

[20:02] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil If you beat the campaign early would you consider trying a 
match or two of Starfighter Assault? It's the one game mode you haven't tried yet. 

[20:02] <darthradovanviking> i find it laggy and unstable in comparison to 7 

[20:03] <djrunol> i dunno what problems people have, never had any issue with windows 10

taken to a hospital where she was later pronounced dead. Her agency later confirmed that she died at the age of 
57 from aortic dissection.. She was The Original JP VA of Bulma of the Dragonball Series throughout 
[20:03] <bentboxer> dspHmm 

[20:03] <segregate> can I still submit fanart for the pre streams? @DarksydePhil 

[20:04] <darthradovanviking> probably depends on hardware and whatever you use it with. But I uppgrated my 
pc. 

[20:04] <darthradovanviking> And with windows 10 it\s more unstable then 7 
[20:04] <valates> @DarthRadovanViking define unstable/ 

[20:04] <darthradovanviking> pc locking up programs crashing? 

[20:04] <jack_spartacus> I miss win 7 

[20:05] <valates> blue screen message youre getting? 

[20:05] <valates> programs shouldnt crash if you just use compatability mode 
[20:05] <segregate> alright thank you 

[20:05] <dominonova> cheer45 for some reason bits are more expensive when you buy the on the twitch app 
than when you are using the PC 

[20:06] <darthradovanviking> it doesn't crash the PC it is just laggy 

[20:06] <obltv> @DominoNova its because of taxes & fees for buying mobile 

[20:06] <darthradovanviking> it have become better over time with updates thouhg 

[20:07] <darthradovanviking> But I really miss win7 If I could downgrade it would have done 

[20:07] <nightbot> renjessejames just tipped $101.00 

[20:07] <darthradovanviking> OOOH 

[20:07] <valates> how does patreon not have the capability to have a live value on the public amount? If they 
have the feature it kinda seems like its just gonna be updated immediately. Where on earth is there any 
information on patreon making this auto assumption about percentage? Do they just knock 10% off of people 
who earn ~30k a month? 

[20:07] <popsicolo> PogChamp 
[20:08] <katexo234> :0 :0 

[20:08] <darthradovanviking> nice tip rensessjames 
[20:08] <darkness_scorpion> damn 

[20:08] <valates> @DarthRadovanViking lag is probably CPU utilization being overdone but Im guessing you 

know how to check that 

[20:08] <gutty333> wow Phil is banking 

[20:08] <thespiccoli> Yes I was, I forgot to resub 

[20:08] <thespiccoli> My bad 

[20:09] <darthradovanviking> i don't know i have a ryzen 7 16 thread processor so i just thought that would be 
einough @valates 

[20:09] <thesupervillain543> Kappa 

[20:09] <jack_spartacus> win8 was okay but 7 was great.

[21:01] <lickmybussy> We’ve reached that part of the playthrough 
[21:01] <mose2118> OK, here we go 

[21:01] <darthjawal 1> All you have to do is sell your soul to EA 
[21:01] <darthjawal 1> And you win 
[21:01] <lickmybussy> Then buy it back as DLC 
[21:01] <timboslicegb> is this last mission? 

[21:01] <darthjawal 1> But it costs another soul 

[21:02] <darthjawal 1> So you can never get your life back 

[21:02] <dsphil> Metacritica€™s user rating on this game is 0.8/10 LUL 

[21:02] <darthjawal 1> Welcome to gambling addiction 101

[21:03] <pinkdam> the hateful truth reviews are good 

[21:04] <darthjawal 1> Is this game better than Battlefield One 

[21:04] <darthjawal 1> I think it just looks like a crappy version of that 

[21:04] <concretecasket> agreed @Pinkdam 

[21:04] <darthjawal 1> Phil should play Online Yugioh on stream 

[21:05] <drew871105> Question, What happens if you actually write "cheer" and the number next to it in chat? 

[21:05] <timboslicegb> ea makes bank on microtranactions on all thier games 

[21:05] <dsphil> @darthjawal 1 Very true

[21:23] <darthradovanviking> it was such a dumb thing when kylo couldnt defeat that girl though. Oh i just 
found this light saber and I have no training. Now i will win 
[21:23] <jaxunhero> It’s rei? 

[21:23] <jelseal973> dought it 

[21:24] <popsicolo> Kylo Ren lost to a girl with no force training. CarlSmile 
[21:24] <lickmybussy> Because he was injured

[21:24] <jannedaarcl35> nah, it was ridiculous 
[21:24] <jannedaarcl35> i agree with darth 

[21:24] <neospartanhesperos9> Rey is just a natural at being a Jedi LUL 
[21:24] <jannedaarcl35> compltely unbelievable 
[21:24] <saking91> it's called a movie 
[21:24] <kushiyakitori> much like the entire series 

[21:24] <darthradovanviking> i thought it was far fetched joda and obi wan could just magically make luke 
strong too 

[21:24] <gab00332> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Luke didn’t even completed the training 

[21:25] <popsicolo> "Sometime I talk to my grampa's melted head and it says 'Yipee!'" -Kylo Ren 

[21:25] <jannedaarcl35> but at least with luke it took him a while to be competent 

[21:25] <darthradovanviking> true 

[21:25] <jannedaarcl35> rei was like, surprise! 

[21:25] <jannedaarcl35> im mad strong 

[21:25] <neospartanhesperos9> @GAB00332 So they’re both natural at being Jedis LUL 
[21:25] <darthradovanviking> yeah i had a revelation type of bullshit :C 
[21:25] <dsphil> Admirable or Impish? 



[21:26] <concretecasket> lol 

[21:26] <12_btw_hahaha> lol he is killing memories of first order troops 

[21:26] <gab00332> Luke never trained with his saber, people are mad at Rey because she is a woman, some 
losers all they have left is being a man 

[21:26] <darthradovanviking> luke should have been turned to the dark syde. And jar jar should have been a sith. 
The end. A much betteer starwars 

[21:26] <12_btw_hahaha> @GAB00332 it made sense with luje tho since he was the sone of the chosen 
[21:26] <12_btw_hahaha> one
