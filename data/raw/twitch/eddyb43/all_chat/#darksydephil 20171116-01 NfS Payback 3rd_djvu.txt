of you are here every day. 

[12:38] <bethemadeagle> i watch a few others than just phil and they are more popular than phil but phil 
deserves more fans or subs than he has so 

[12:38] <theycallmetxt> Oh? Why does Phil deserve them more?

[12:39] <bethemadeagle> most of the other people i watch changed to suit youtube phil never changed but he 
gets shat on which makes him lose subs for no reason 

[12:39] <theycallmetxt> But he did trash Twitch for the longest time, then changed to suit Twitch. How is that

[12:52] <bethemadeagle> night in the woods is a piece of racid dog shit 
[12:52] <taymanicel234> but I guess people don’t like tgat 
[12:52] <khaosrayne> @pray4rock seriously!! 

[12:52] <bethemadeagle> rancid* 

[12:52] <thatanonybear> @BetheMadEagle pis understand 

[12:52] <sprank_n> Battlefront 2 loot box system is being investigated in Europe and could possibly get EA to 
pay fines or remove the game from stores 
[12:52] <bethemadeagle> i cant 
[12:52] <darksydegeoff> :) 

[12:52] <thatanonybear> v_V

[12:53] <cookiemonster414> allah BlessRNG 
[12:53] <thenewfaceofcreation> he said allah? 

[12:53] <pray4rock> Just like Hearthstone 

[12:53] <eldeadmariachi> Now that Dead Space is dead other than FIFA I don’t care about EA anymore. 

[12:53] <i_came_here_to_something> Didn’t Shadow of War do the same thing? 

[12:53] <paddingtonbearl87> allah akhbar? OSsloth 
[12:53] <sprank_n> @I_Came_Here_To_Something nope 

[12:53] <khaosrayne> @ThatAnonyBear nah, i need a sure thing., my funds are limited already 

[12:54] <korewasugoi> the only microtransactions im okay with are the ones found in Warframe 

[12:54] <khaosrayne> I dont gamble lol 

[12:54] <goldencolts> hey dudes 

[12:54] <korewasugoi> doing it right 

[12:54] <jonathan_snow> Dokkan Summoning 

[12:54] <whiit3shadow> @DarksydePhil i put the time in on my account lol 

[12:54] <i_came_here_to_something> @Sprank_N I definitely recall Act 4 of that game being a grindfest you 

had to pay out money for to beat in a reasonable span of time 

[12:55] <thatanonybear> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194 

[12:55] <eldeadmariachi> I want Luke's looks 

[12:55] <babyvampirethug> cheer 10 

[12:55] <goldencolts> you shouldn’t have to gamble or invest massive ammounts of time to unlock core parts of 
the game experience NotLikeThis 

[12:55] <infinite_55> The 1% of addicts, shouldn’t ruin it for the 99% that are not. I'm still against loot boxes 
though. 

[12:55] <johny_alumni> Bugged loot box mechanics 
[12:55] <tigerflamessssss> PowerUpL YouDontSay PowerUpR 
[12:55] <goldencolts> which is the reason people are upset 
[12:55] <korewasugoi> Battlefront 2 is a F2P sold with a full price 

[12:55] <atlastelamon9> The Dutch government is investigating the setup of Battlefront 2 due to gambling laws 
[12:55] <nietzschescholar> why does this streamer keep snorting? 

[12:56] <thatanonybear> @NietzscheScholar medical conditions 

[12:56] <pray4rock> All these games are being intentional designed for the consumer to spend money on boxes 

[12:56] <sprank_n> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Not really, i played through the entirety of Act 4 and beat it 

in a very reasonable time without spending a dime so the loot boxes are not tied to progression 

[12:56] <johny_alumni> @nietzschescholar nasal drip 

[12:56] <eldeadmariachi> I heard that Belgium is also investigating EA too 

[12:56] <bentboxer> he fucked your piggy momma @NietzscheScholar 

[12:56] <thatanonybear> @bentboxer WOW 

[12:56] <paddingtonbearl87> bent calm ur tits 

[12:56] <thatanonybear> thats vulgah 

[12:56] <korewasugoi> @bentboxer man was asking an legit question and you have to be an ass? 

[12:56] <thenewfaceofcreation> @bentboxer be nice man 
[12:57] <jonathan_snow> Phil should do a Dokkan battle stream 

[12:57] <i_came_here_to_something> @Sprank_N The thing is tho, I don’t think many other people actually did 
that. 

[12:57] <strawberrypantsu> WE WAS KANGS 

[12:57] <thatanonybear> @KoreWaSugoi it's a joke, obv lol 

[12:57] <goldencolts> cmonBruh 



[12:57] <korewasugoi> Battlefront 2 should be F2P 

[12:57] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something That's their prerogative though, yeah? 

[12:57] <thatanonybear> they cut out the retof the content for the season pass 
[12:57] <whiit3shadow> he could, but he would need to cover up so much of the screen 

[12:57] <sprank_n> @I_Came_Here_To_Something well if they decided to purchase in-game money thats there 

fault for being impatient not the developers fault 

[12:58] <whiit3shadow> or trolls would try to steal his account 

[12:58] <tantamounter> cheer 100 

[12:58] <atlastelamon9> There are never enough servers 

[12:58] <thatanonybear> @Sprank_N it's not about assigning fault, but assigning responsibility 
[12:58] <atlastelamon9> Do they have dedicated servers? 

[12:58] <korewasugoi> rocket league on the switch tho Kreygasm 

[12:58] <thatanonybear> devs are responsible for implementing this exploitation 

[12:58] <solidussnakex> The game is already out for people who preordered the deluxe edition 

[12:59] <runki> single player requires online aswell so it might be down too 

[12:59] <i_came_here_to_something> @ChairmanCaleb @Sprank_N I think it's just more an issue why a $60 
AAA game needs to include yet more stuff to pay for on top of regular DLC, especially when that extra stuff is 
usually for games that are offered at big discount or free. It stinks of greed. 

[12:59] <thatanonybear> supposedly the game is very broken to 

[12:59] <hurshat> i refuse to buy ANY game which uses microtransactions or season passes, on principle, i agree 
with everyone who makes arguments against both of these atrocious facets of modern games. 

[12:59] <jetset3000> fuck EA 

[12:59] <flyeaglesfly01> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Its EA 

[13:00] <paddingtonbearl87> wtf 

[13:00] <atlastelamon9> Bullshit early access 

[13:00] <moeneek_thethird> geez 

[13:00] <nietzschescholar> ewww gross 

[13:00] <korewasugoi> Origin access isnt really an "controversy" 

[13:00] <goldencolts> ScaredyCat 
[13:00] <paddingtonbearl87> cmonBruh 
[13:00] <mysteriousmaster01> fuckin ell 

[13:00] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Because it's their product. Don't like it, don’t buy it. 
You can call it greed, but it's also their prerogative to do what they want w/ their product. 

[13:00] <sledgehammer_devl> such profession 
[13:00] <jetset3000> AMPTropPunch 
[13:00] <flyeaglesfly01> @ChairmanCaleb lol 

[13:00] <thatanonybear> cheerlO WWE 2K18 had the same practice with preordering at a higher price for early 
access 

[13:00] <eldeadmariachi> "I can't stop burping, I can't stop, don't know how to stop" 

[13:00] <ornightz> cheerlO so yeah a 57 yr old manga artist married a 20 yr old Model all the while he had a 
fiancee and is now getting Flak for it, your thoughts ? 

[13:00] <goldencolts> ??? LUL 

[13:01] <korewasugoi> well Pubg is an nominee for GOTY and the game is in early access. 

[13:01] <flyeaglesfly01> @ChairmanCaleb What theyre doing is fucked tbh. I love EA games but its still wrong 
[13:01] <chairmancaleb> @Ornightz Do you really think he’s going to know anything about that? lmao 
[13:01] <goldencolts> what does that have to do with anything even LUL 
[13:01] <aproxymate> Origin access dude 

[13:01] <ornightz> ChairmanCaleb I doubt anyone right now , just found out about it this morning 

[13:01] <wxrxaxtxh> SHALID 

[13:01] <korewasugoi> Origin access is not bad 

[13:01] <chairmancaleb> @FlyEaglesFly01 I didn’t say I disagree, but you vote w/ your wallets. Don't support 
the micro transactions. 




[13:01] <aproxymate> No one paid $20. They had origin access 
[13:01] <thenewfaceofcreation> SHAILD 

[13:02] <johny_alumni> When a company tells you they own you 
[13:02] <solidussnakex> I've been playing it and It’s totally worth it 
[13:02] <thenewfaceofcreation> @WxRxAxTxH hi dood 

[13:02] <sprank_n> @I_Came_Here_To_Something the main issue i have with loot boxes is when they hinder 
progression behind paywalls, shadow of war doesn't do that. IMO if you paid to blast through act 4 instead of 
playing for a good 4 hours thats your own fault. And you are responsible for your own actions. 

[13:02] <korewasugoi> @Aproxymate yeah, thats where most got the game early 
[13:02] <kittyspank> then why play lol 
[13:02] <flyeaglesfly01> @ChairmanCaleb Your right 
[13:02] <johny_alumni> Screw you ea 

[13:02] <thatanonybear> some people are born livid about this 
[13:02] <dankmemeking840> there is a cool down on earning credits too 
[13:02] <wxrxaxtxh> FOCUSED\ 

[13:02] <i_came_here_to_something> @ChairmanCaleb I agree. But why do some people get called out for 
deciding to do that, and boycott games that do such practices? I've heard people call those sort "immature 
children" and stuff like that. Boycotting greedy business tactics shouldn’t be ridiculed. 

[13:02] <pray4rock> Gotta vote with your wallet 
[13:02] <bethemadeagle> wrath hello 

[13:02] <kittyspank> its like complaining about healthcare then voting republican 
[13:02] <wxrxaxtxh> hello bethe 

[13:02] <solidussnakex> All the die will be free this year 

[13:03] <thatanonybear> @pray4rock voting with your wallet affects the devs, not the publishers who are 
orchestrating this. Speaking out loudly like they did on Reddit affects more change than anything else 
[13:03] <korewasugoi> they should have just remade the original Battlefront 2 and 1 
[13:03] <aproxymate> That's the problem @kittyspank. People complain but still open their wallets 
[13:03] <chairmancaleb> Can't even have a conversation in R9k mode, sheesh. 

[13:03] <kittyspank> psycological manipulation is a bitch

[13:04] <i_came_here_to_something> @Sprank_N TBF you can do the same thing in a lot of mobile games that 
you can do in Shadows of War. It would just take a lot longer, and some of them use artificial timer limits. But 
compared to other AAA console/PC games without that stuff, SoW has a noticeable grind to that last act.

with your mind

[14:05] <bionich00t> Just saying, making profit off something doesn’t make it good, otherwise monopolies are 
good

[14:05] <thatanonybear> @Sprank_N and Australia/New Zealand iirc

[14:05] <darkamp_48> I like crashing cars Kappa 

[14:05] <karlis_k> @Bionich00t so, cigarettes, alcohol and other addictive substances are completely fine 

[14:05] <thatanonybear> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz yep 

[14:05] <divanerasmus> @Bobbi_Ling you really dont like beautiful cars ? 

[14:05] <kurojp> weed isn't any more dangerous than tobacco or alcohol 

[14:05] <thatanonybear> caffeine is awful 

[14:05] <frankenfunk> weed is a lot safer then drinking alcohol 

[14:05] <sprank_n> @ThatAnonyBear only place i've been where Pot and Hoes are lega was Amsterdam

[14:10] <thenewfaceofcreation> ok 
[14:10] <darkamp_48> can I? 

[14:10] <bethemadeagle> what about ps3 tony hawk or ps4 tony hawk 
[14:10] <maminas> Tony hawk pro skater 5 was great! best game in series so far! 

[14:10] <thatanonybear> PS3 Tony Hawk 
[14:10] <megajonesy> oh shit its my man DSP 
[14:10] <thatanonybear> Project 8 is p good 
[14:10] <kovorus> project 8 was shit 
[14:11] <bobbi_ling> underground was best 
[14:11] <maminas> project 7 was way better 
[14:11] <kovorus> American Wasteland was better 

[14:11] <dukaduka> I played Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Matt Hoffman BMX, and Skate. Skate is definitely the best 

[14:11] <ragegamingl24> Need for Seed : the Jess story 

[14:11] <bobbi ling> skate is different 

[14:11] <forautoa> I liked the undergrounds on xbox. 

[14:11] <kovorus> Tony Hawk series»»>Skate PogChamp 
[14:11] <megajonesy> skate is way better 

[14:11] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> bmx xxx for pixelated boobies 

[14:11] <kovorus> wow dood 

[14:11] <bobbi_ling> tony is arcade, skate is realistic 

[14:12] <thatanonybear> i enjoyed P8 lol 

[14:12] <bethemadeagle> tony is better 

[14:12] <sprank_n> Bikes is way better 

[14:12] <thatanonybear> better than THAW or THUG2 



[14:12] <ratchefanl2> @TheNewFaceofCreation how ya doing man 

[14:12] <maminas> the only good skating game ever released was pro skater 5, the realism is off the charts 
[14:12] <forautoa> Pro Skater 2 & 3 are probably my favorites though. 

[14:12] <i_came_here_to_something> Top Skater > Tony Hawk 

[14:12] <divanerasmus> @thatanonybear do you have this game? you should it reminded me allot of need for 

speed underground in night races 

[14:12] <sprank_n> skating games are all thrash 

[14:12] <thatanonybear> @DivanErasmus i dont have this an i would only pick it up for like $10 tbh

[14:13] <maminas> anyone remembers rockstar racer game series? midnight club? i thought those racing games 
where incredible, enjoy the shit out of them! 

[14:13] <thatanonybear> i got both previous NFS games for $10 combined 

[14:13] <dukaduka> Need for Speed used to be about races and upgrades. This feels more about a linear story. 
[14:13] <bethemadeagle> :eagle: fists :bear: 

[14:13] <nightbot> Golden Colts just tipped $2.00 

[14:13] <megajonesy> cheer 15 Hey DSP I havent watched you in years 

[14:13] <forautoa> I want to play this only because I've played every NFS, even that always online garbage. 
[14:13] <thatanonybear> @maminas MC3 Dub Edition is the gold standard for racing games imo 
[14:13] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N OpieOP 

[14:13] <frankenfunk> the only racing games i really enjoy are Burnout 3, Trackmania, and mario kart 
[14:13] <forautoa> But they aint getting full price outta me this time. 

[14:13] <darkamp_48> YOU DID IT ! ! SeemsGood 
[14:13] <sprank_n> @dukaduka it's true though 

[14:14] <divanerasmus> well story is not long but try online multilayer and need for speed underground rush and 
chaos comes back 

[14:14] <kovorus> YOU BLEW IT! 

[14:14] <dukaduka> @Frankenfunk Burnout 3 is destruction fun, so is Paradise. Flatout was a little to ragdolly 
[14:14] <thatanonybear> @BetheMadEagle you mean fistbump??? 

[14:14] <thatanonybear> o_0 
[14:14] <bethemadeagle> no fisting 

[14:14] <bobbi_ling> phil reading moderator beths email -> dspFacepalm 

[14:14] <maminas> @ThatAnonyBear agreed, the game was challenging, yet fair, had great variety of racing 
tracks, cars, and soundtrack was great too, i kinda want to replay it now :D 
[14:14] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N not if you grew up in the 90s watching the x games :D 
[14:14] <forautoa> We need another Burnout Paradise. 

[14:14] <maminas> and steering felt nice 
[14:14] <forautoa> Paradise was great. 

[14:14] <easor> anyone knows if nfs will be in any deal for black friday?? 

[14:14] <bethemadeagle> bobbi more like dspSurpriseddsp cause he excited 
[14:14] <bobbi_ling> beth

[14:15] <kovorus> THUG 2's soundtrac 

[14:15] <sprank_n> @dukaduka i grew up in the 90’s but the games were trash, not taking shots at the pro 
skaters, just at the trash games 



[14:15] <maminas> wtf 

[14:15] <maminas> some random dude starts pining me messaging "N" word over and over lol 
[14:15] <kovorus> same 

[14:16] <movielordl01> @DarksydePhil Free Battlefront 2 story DLC coming in december just so you know. 
[14:16] <divanerasmus> @darksydephil would you rather sell a very expensive price car or keep it? 

[14:16] <ratchefanl2> they do it to me too Maminas 

[14:16] <bethemadeagle> hey phil its bethe from chat i would like to be mod if you want me to be. there bobbi 

[14:16] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N what did you want from them then? :D 

[14:16] <maminas> wtf is up that? are those dsp trolls or thats a thing on twitch now? 

[14:16] <maminas> wtf is up with that* 

[14:16] <sprank_n> @dukaduka to give you a fair comparison skating games are the equivalent to movie 

adaptation games, they are just cash-ins 

[14:17] <madraneO 1 > PR 

[14:17] <bobbi_ling> thats patheticf beth. 

[14:17] <i_came_here_to_something> I miss real arcade racers. Burnout, PGR, Sega Rally, Scud Racer, Ridge 
Racer, Daytona, Ace Driver, San Fran Rush, even the Cruisn’ games. Fun, simple, but w/ lots of secrets and 
depth. Vibrant. Now everything wants to be either sim or Fast n' Furious. 

[14:17] <chairmancaleb> @maminas Turn your whispers to follow only mode. They're bot accounts and will 
continue to PM you unless you do that. 

[14:17] <bethemadeagle> bobbi it worked 

[14:17] <thatanonybear> @BetheMadEagle sounds like mine :D 

[14:17] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[14:17] <bobbi_ling> he had no choice 

[14:17] <forautoa> @i_came_here_to_something San Francisco Rush 2049 on the dreamcast was MY SHIT. 
[14:17] <sprank_n> @dukaduka nothing i’m just baffled at how people argue about which skating game was 
better when in reality they are bad 

[14:17] <maminas> @ChainnanCaleb but is this dsp releated thing? or those are just twitch trolls in general? 
[14:17] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Can’t see DSP driving a douche hummer 
[14:18] <ilegendknight> hey everyone and phill 
[14:18] <chairmancaleb> @maminas Not a clue. 

[14:18] <bethemadeagle> bobbi why cause no one else asked? 

[14:18] <bobbi_ling> you attach your CV beth? 

[14:18] <i_came_here_to_something> @ForAutoA I never got a chance to play the Dreamcast version, but I 

heard it was excellent 

[14:18] <bethemadeagle> no bobbi 

[14:18] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N have you played all of them? That's like calling every movie game bad without 
having played it. 

[14:18] <bethemadeagle> this isnt a job 

[14:18] <bobbi_Ung> what is it 

[14:18] <frankenfunk> all skating games bad LUL 

[14:18] <frankenfunk> Must be a LOL player LUL 

[14:19] <bethemadeagle> bobbi it is me being helpful for phils chat 

[14:19] <divanerasmus> I agree @darksydephil but I love driving and dominating the road, in some countries 

you get respected by the car you drive while on the road 

[14:19] <bethemadeagle> its a free service 

[14:19] <bobbi_ling> by turning r9k on and off dspFacepahn 

[14:19] <forautoa> @i_came_here_to_something Definitely some of the most fun I had on Dreamcast, me and 
my cousin would play it all the time. Great game. I definitely agree, there just isn’t any real arcade style racers 
anymore. 

[14:19] <karlis_k> cheer should’ve checked himself before he wrecked himself 
[14:19] <kurojp> Nothing demands as much respect as a toyota prius

[14:20] <bobbi ling> do you wear a suit while you modding beth? 

[14:21] <bos2161>LUL 

[14:21] <i_came_here_to_something> @ForAutoA The closest on consoles is Driveclub, but it launched 
half-done. Sega has a new Daytona in arcades but it's just a reskin of the original. I'm looking forward to their 
Sega World Drivers Championship game tho, that's looking really good. Arcade-only again tho, for now :( 

[14:21] <sprank_n> @dukaduka i played a good chu nk of skate games and movie adaptation games, and its not 
just my opinion. It's an already accepted norm that these games are terrible cash-ins with only around 10 hours of 
repetitive gameplay and no innovation, although to be fair it's hard to innovate those kinds of games 
[14:21] <dukaduka> @DivanErasmus A car is a status symbol, so i get that. I just miss the upgrade oriented game 
[14:21] <i_came_here_to_something> @maminas I had too much fun w/ PGR4 xD

[14:22] <divanerasmus> @dukaduka ?upgrade? 

[14:22] <forautoa> @i_came_here_to_something Honestly I wish wish Sega still had more dominance in the 

game industry. I loved their consoles and their arcade game ideas. I really hope some day they come back strong. 

[14:22] <bobbMing> yellow raincoat 

[14:22] <gola2222> Five-0 time to go 

[14:22] <bobbi ling> leak in my ceiling 

[14:22] <bethemadeagle> :clown: 

[14:22] <frankenfunk> Super Metroid was a short game and a lot of people say that it's the greatest game of all 
time., you can’t say something is bad because its short 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> damn it 
[14:22] <bethemadeagle> ah well 

[14:22] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N I've played a good number of racing games and skate/bike games. It depends 
on what you want from the game. 

[14:23] <bethemadeagle> dspEw dspEw bobbi 
[14:23] <forautoa> The cops in this game seem kinda BrokeBack 
[14:23] <divanerasmus> you can upgrade your car @dukaduka 
[14:23] <bobbi_ling> im in dungarees beth 
[14:23] <minnowpause> your so good 

[14:23] <dukaduka> @DivanErasmus what this game has, but insteada of unlocking with lootboxes, you beat 

someone else and you get parts like that 

[14:24] <madrane01> how to waste 10$ lol 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> dspEw bobbi 

[14:24] <madrane01> ack ack ack acka ck 



[14:24] <i_came_here_to_something> @ForAutoA Definitely. Their arcade games deserve way more respect 
than they seem to get. They’re investing in new arcade stuff tho like World Drivers that could get console ports 
hopefully. I’d love a new Sega console too, or at least new releases in IP like Outrun and Panzer Dragoon. 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> bobbi what you need is a straight jacket :D 
[14:24] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @madrane01 GTAB LUL 

[14:24] <dukaduka> @DivanErasmus it was so much deeper back in the older games 
[14:24] <bobbi_fing> they look kewl 

[14:24] <i_came_here_to_something> Give me Sega + Nintendo, and I could care less about Microsoft and Sony 
tbh. 

[14:24] <sockafock> i bet the broker is a woman 

[14:24] <sprank_n> @dukaduka true, but when i played those games back the i didn’t really expect anything 
from them anyways 

[14:25] <dankmemeking840> loot boxes PogChamp 

[14:25] <thatanonybear> the entertainer, my favorite Billy Joel song 

[14:25] <thatanonybear> jk, it's "Get It Right the First Time" 

[14:25] <bethemadeagle> tomorrow im getting sonic forces fuck battlefront 
[14:25] <thatanonybear> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIE-jZyITxO 
[14:25] <bobbi_ling> that game looks bad beth. at least it has gaaras voice actor 
[14:26] <bethemadeagle> bobbi but it has silver in it 

[14:26] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N I just don’t know what you're calling "bad" then :D I liked all the moves and 
level design of the games. The graphics varied and the realism wasn't really there until Skate 3. 

[14:26] <bobbi_ling> BigPhish GAARA 

[14:26] <divanerasmus> @darksydephil keep as many part tokens as possible you really need them in the later 

part of the game when you got you ultimate car and need to reach the best possible level 

[14:26] <frankenfunk> Everyone knows the best Billy Joel song is Anthon's song 

[14:26] <bos2161> cheerl5 

[14:27] <bethemadeagle> gaara? 

[14:27] <bethemadeagle> never heard of it

[14:28] <sk8rslim> Liam O’Brien 

[14:28] <frankenfunk> battlefront 2 is a rushed buggy shitstorm filled with PTW ftp bullshit 
[14:28] <bethemadeagle> bobbi stop being rude or you get spanked 

[14:28] <forautoa> @i_came_here_to_something PM’d ya so we don't keep hogging chat. :) 

[14:28] <sprank_n> @dukaduka they are bad because those were games that the only expectations you had were 

that you could play them whenever you had to kill time and had nothing better to play or do, but hold your 

response till i get back cause i have to go drop a deuce 

[14:28] <thatanonybear> bobbi, that's a pddlin 

[14:28] <thatanonybear> *paddlin 

[14:29] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling It is out

[14:49] <dukaduka> @Sprank_N my favorite games were always sports games and lighting games. I did really 

like mario sunshine though

[14:51] <thatanonybear> @Bobbi_Ling there is a version with lyics, but it was never recorded for an album

[14:53] <djrunol> so... even considering this is the 3rd stream for nfs, he is still using the handbrake to "drift"? 
[14:54] <admanbert> this game worth it or nah? 

[14:54] <rizzling> Probably would be if it wasn’t made by EA. 

[14:54] <dukaduka> @Admanbert nah 
[14:54] <tomahawkings> More like meh 

[14:54] <solidussnakex> @lvlpower well It's definitely better than the first one 

[14:54] <djrunol> i do have to say it is a lot better than the "reboot" in 2015 

[14:54] <admanbert> guess i’ll pick it up when it's $20 

[14:54] <dukaduka> @DJRunol that I can agree with

[15:33] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @thatanonybear do you think Phil should wear a WWE ugly Christmas 
sweater? 

[15:33] <francellmillergaming> Nfs: the run is the best. 

[15:33] <hardcastlel971> you have to wreck the cops, most people will try to outrun them, no point trying 

[15:33] <grizzlyjee> Digimon was the shit though 

[15:33] <04jetta> @LorAutoA Digital Adventure Tri was really good 

[15:33] <mrjekylll6> @Rizzling Nah, only that he needs to grow up

blue rings of spikes.

[15:37] <forautoa> @grizzlyjee Yeah man, my personal favorite was world 2. As unpopular an opinion that is. 

World 3 was second, I didn’t like World 1 as much because you had to baby sit ya digimon and it would just 

poop everywhere. DansGame

[15:38] <aloofone> omg really? 

[15:38] <rizzling> Everyone got it long before you bro

[15:47] <grizzlyjee> I think I've noticed your problem, you're not going fast enough 

[15:47] <doctorzzz> damn why is the top speed so low NotLikeThis 

[15:47] <rizzling> It seems like drafting is also a game mechanic to consider 

[15:47] <splatoon7> time for phil to git good 

[15:47] <rizzling> Car rating =/= Top Speed @DarksydePhil 

[15:47] <rizzling> So that explains that 

[15:48] <doctorzzz> its prolly not a good drag car 

[15:48] <enzio814> its acceleration thats holding him back 

[15:48] <darthradovanviking> and top speed 

[15:48] <paddingtonbearl87> yea fuk the bel air 

[15:48] <kjones4140> sell it 

[15:48] <splatoon7> nothing is wrong with his car lol

[16:38] <i_came_here_to_something> STDs is the more popular shorthand tho and it's been that way since the 
'90s. But, people also referred to them as STIs around then too, simply not nearly as much. 

[16:38] <djrunol> phil is the only guy i can trust to get lost on a racing track 
[16:38] <brahski20> You guys ever had an std?

[16:39] <neospartanhesperos9> cheerlO not all STI’s cause a disease, they are in your body without showing 
symptoms, an STD is created from an STI, and so in an STD you show symptoms. Not all STI's will result in an 
STD but all STD’s are STIs

brain, easiest explenation ever 

[16:42] <neospartanhesperos9> I dont get how what i said was complicated. A disease you showed symptoms, an 
infection you have the vrius but don't show symptoms. An infection can turn into a disease. 

[16:43] <i_came_here_to_something> Oh, true. Cost of living is really high in California, indeed.
