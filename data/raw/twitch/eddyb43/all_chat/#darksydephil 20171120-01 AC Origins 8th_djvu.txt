[13:39] <bethemadeagle> bear i gave up after 3 fuck act 4 

[13:40] <chaosalltheway> Destiny and Witcher 3 had that system too tho 

[13:40] <drptolemy> fishing boat will always go to you when in the water 

[13:40] <encelor> Witcher 3 was about skill 

[13:40] <thatanonybear> "Witcher 3's not THAT bad" 

[13:40] <royalfanl21> Shame I couldna€™t do the special challenge wasna€™t right level 
[13:40] <khaosrayne> also, those boat guys are doing you a favor, they're programed to coem to you when you're 
in the water and yhou dont have a boat so you dont get stuck out somewhere without one if you get attacked and 
your boat gets crushed 

[13:41] <bethemadeagle> that guy was a commander he is usually harder to kill in the first place anyway 
[13:41] <theycallmejimbob> I put 38 hours into that game BetheMadEagle

i've seen 

[13:47] <heavygameboy> Is darksydphil going to play Dragon ball figher Z again? 

[13:47] <bethemadeagle> my shield was great as well 

[13:47] <malcom86> Just wait for it, for a moment I thought he could really do the mission spamming R2 and 
playing like shit 

[13:47] <encelor> whenever it comes out 
[13:47] <the_elusiveone45> lmfao 

[13:47] <davysockett> how are you supposed to play this if you cant dodge... wow 
[13:48] <vendatus> yes in January LUL 

[13:48] <bethemadeagle> i hear that the die is going to involve a undead pharaoh and a undead army 
[13:48] <bethemadeagle> there is another die as well coming out 

[13:49] <khaosrayne> I know i’m sounding like an ass, but this is one of my favorite, if not my favorite 
franchises, I've been with this series from the start., this game is awesome., these are his mistakes while playing, 
not the games 

[13:49] <encelor> lol if someone touched me while i was searching for a murderer i wouldn’t go huh i would 
scream like a bitch 

[13:49] <vendatus> So The Mummy LUL

[13:50] <khaosrayne> anyway., thanks for the conversation guys., gotta go now... take it easy everyone 
[13:50] <grizzlyjee> @khaosrayne No I think you're completely right, I men it's not like he hasn’t played any of 
the other assassins creed games so he should have the formula down by now, it's not like it changes much game 
to game 

[13:50] <vendatus> Fanbois dspPepe 
[13:50] <thatanonybear> das fin 
[13:50] <encelor> Za wardo? 

[13:50] <katexo234> jimbob are you a fanboy?

game but unity and assassins creed 3

[13:51] <grizzlyjee> I'm most likely in the minority but I think assassins credd 3 was the funnest one to play,

assassins where created hence origins 

[15:58] <thebigtj 1337> bayek is a very basic character, he wants revenge, and he's " good " that's about it 
[15:59] <vendatus> I thought she literally stated she wanted to know the origins of the assassins LUL

[16:17] <encelor> @gg_Kyo it has good reviews but then AC orgins got accused for putting fake review 
[16:17] <bammbino> i really like that the quests in this game arent pointless., you get a sense of immersion on 
how tough life was for egyptians 

[16:17] <dkpgames> Now i know what ill watch tonight 

[16:17] <lvlpower> this is reminded of Far Cry 3 

[16:17] <chairmancaleb> @Bammbino It still feels void of any purpose. 

[16:17] <thebigtjl337> gasp 

[16:17] <gg_kyo> @encelor ya i heard it has decent reviews, im just concern if it runs well on pc as some pc 
ports are terrible 

[16:17] <chairmancaleb> Just feels like an open world game with random shit to do. 

[16:17] <chaosalltheway> LUL 

[16:17] <encelor> i see you are a man of culture as well tsosRuse 
[16:17] <bethemadeagle> jim reference

[16:17] <bammbino> @ChairmanCaleb you probably didnt play the game 

[16:17] <chairmancaleb> Go wild and have fun really. That's why I stopped playing AC a long time ago. 
[16:18] <encelor> @gg_Kyo steam reviews seem mostly positive 
[16:18] <chairmancaleb> No, I didn’t. No plans to. 

[16:18] <encelor> @gg_Kyo you should give it a glance 
[16:18] <bammbino> cool, so your opinion isnt valid 
[16:18] <chaosalltheway> he's banging Kim Kardashian 
[16:18] <chairmancaleb> Tell me what it does for the story? 

[16:18] <gg_kyo> @encelor definitely considering :) 

[16:18] <chairmancaleb> If it doesn’t do anything new, then I like my opinion.

[16:20] <lord_dink> they should add that into games, taller enemies slow down and gas out 

[16:20] <thebigtjl337> UGH 

[16:20] <bethemadeagle> nah we dont need a army 

[16:20] <chairmancaleb> AC had a purpose with Abstergo and the ones who came before like Juno and such. 
Now it's like they don’t matter much anymore. "Oh, Abstergo is still being the mean bully, go unravel their 
bullshit." 

[16:20] <bethemadeagle> we need something better

[16:20] <chaosalltheway> LUL true 

[16:20] <shillaryclintoon> remember when assassins creed used to have you actually assassinate people? 

[16:20] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @lord_dink 780ti runs out of gas before 1060 LUL 

[16:20] <encelor> they carry more weight more energy spent 

[16:20] <dkpgames> Would be perfect for the deset 

[16:21] <shillaryclintoon> and not hit scrubs with clubs 

[16:21] <thiccbwoii> ya exactly 

[16:21] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Wherea€™s Desmond when you need him 
[16:21] <bethemadeagle> dead 

[16:21] <lord_dink> i’m on 780ti right now, going strong has more fans than 1060 and $50 cheaper 
[16:21] <encelor> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 he ded 

[16:21] <chairmancaleb> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 Ubisoft killed him off after they fired Patrice who originally 
led the project. 

[16:21] <vendatus> you still assassin people NotLikeThis 
[16:21] <dkpgames> Buy a off road car phil 

[16:21] <chairmancaleb> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 AC originally was supposed to end with 3, but noooope. 

[16:22] <thiccbwoii> 780TI TOP KEK 

[16:22] <lord_dink> 780ti = 910 = 1060 but cheaper

[16:23] <thiccbwoii> ya it is i kno for like 95% of games 

[16:23] <burakkuauto> well, Abstergo is trying to resurrect the precursors aka those who came before., so, 
they’re looking for a coffin of Eden 

[16:23] <bethemadeagle> we all know kate is the true leader 



[16:23] <chaosalltheway> Jebaited 

[16:23] <chairmancaleb> @Burakkuauto I'll give Ubisoft that then, at least they're still making AC somehow 
relevant. 

[16:24] <chairmancaleb> But the original vision isn't here anymore, which is why I'm glad I don't play these 
games anymore. 

[16:24] <bethemadeagle> you realize you need to escort him away as well phil? 

[16:24] <bethemadeagle> AHAHAHAHAHAHA

[16:27] <lord_dink> big guys like that in real life are rare, good genetics which is why females are attracted to 
them but females usually get abused because excess testosterone from being so big makes him violent 
[16:27] <chaosalltheway> nah, spears are better 

[16:27] <bethemadeagle> phil still isnt used to the fighting even though he played this game for how long?

[16:42] <kingjezal> That was too much 

[16:42] <the_elusiveone45> of course it will have tons of glitches 
[16:42] <katexo234> bethe what do you think of Phil's gameplay? 

[16:42] <the_elusiveone45> Witcher 3 is even bigger, and has more glitches lmao 
[16:42] <vendatus> GTA5 is shit tho LUL

[16:43] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil ps4 cant handle alot of things on screen sadly ; ; 

[16:43] <the_elusiveone45> GTA 5 is the second best GTA in the franchise. 

[16:43] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil that doesnt happen on pc 
[16:43] <cresstheangel> 20% of the map in this game is just nothing tho 
[16:43] <misterpsychotic> LUL LUL LUL 
[16:43] <vendatus> Trevor was the best thing in GTA5 

[16:43] <bethemadeagle> kate well it is very glitchy in that fort and i did that fort and it never glitched on me, 



phil is a glitch/bug magnet for sure 

[16:43] <dooley258> Therea€™s way too many side missions in this game 

[16:43] <the_elusiveone45> Original PS4 is pretty weak these days. I may buy a pro soon. 

[16:44] <encelor> Shark cards where best thing in GTA V 
[16:44] <encelor> Keepo 

[16:44] <dooley258> Buy a pro if you have a 4K tv 
[16:44] <burakkuauto> GTA5 is just online anymore 
[16:44] <vendatus> I’d argue 3rd best GTA 

[16:44] <dylannw> Devs are too lazy...just look Horizon Zero Dawn 
[16:44] <cresstheangel> I'll never buy a half generation console 
[16:44] <katexo234> well said bethe 
[16:44] <burakkuauto> GTA4 best GTA 
[16:44] <mrkachow498> thats true 

[16:44] <bethemadeagle> bammbino dont diss the ps4 it isnt the console fault 
[16:44] <the_elusiveone45> gta4 is ass 
[16:44] <bethemadeagle> im with phil 
[16:44] <vendatus> it's the console 

[16:44] <encelor> @BetheMadEagle phil never glitched tho 
[16:44] <djrunol> *runs past 3 boats* there is no boat here Kappa 
[16:44] <encelor> LUL 

[16:44] <mrkachow498> @The_ElusiveOne45 take that back 

[16:44] <bammbino> @BetheMadEagle i LOVE ps4.. but i also have a 1080ti in my pc.. 

[16:45] <chaosalltheway> danEZ 

[16:45] <dooley258> I feel like they focused on the pro and xbone x for this game because it runs flawless on the 
x 

[16:45] <thiccbwoii> i thought blaks coundlt swim 
[16:45] <amoon8019> Just swim and crazy boat guy will show up 
[16:45] <mrkachow498> uncharted is a really good example 
[16:45] <encelor> sllverWW 

[16:45] <bethemadeagle> we all know san andreas is the best gta enough said 
[16:45] <chaosalltheway> man that's only AC 
[16:45] <bammbino> the super armor shit is annoying lol 
[16:45] <encelor> there where no glitche only ZUUL 

[16:45] <kingjezal> Same goes for Dark Souls which can’t handle places like Blighttown. 

[16:45] <vendatus> eh Vice City was better 
[16:46] <electricspitgaming> cleopatra a sex addict 

[16:46] <dylannw> Horizon Zero Dawn and TW3 are the best open world games in this gen in graphics therms 
[16:46] <xkeysx97> San Andreas is the best had but damn the graphics where really bad 
[16:46] <rorke47> yeah fromsoft suck 
[16:46] <amoon8019> Youa€™ll love the phylakes 

[16:46] <rosshardie> Youa€™re absolutely correct @darksydephil there shouldna€™t be an excuse for that 
[16:46] <chaosalltheway> Multiplatform games are always better on pc, as usual 

[16:46] <djrunol> i am not entirely sure what was so wrong about the old system, where you had no lvl stuff and 
had to rely heavily on stealth 

[16:46] <bethefueg> The console is also an issue tho. Upgrading to the new system will help the frame rate issues 
[16:46] <the_elusiveone45> terrible argument: PS4 1st party devs don’t develop games the same way 3rd party 
devs do. Of course, they are going better than 3rd party titles. They have more time to focus on the exclusive 
itself. 3rd party devs have to focus on each port. 

[16:46] <vendatus> I mean Brock Lesnar could LUL 

[16:46] <bethemadeagle> i played san andreas as my first gta and i loved it and went back to vice city and 3 i 

liked those as well and vice city is a very very close second 

[16:46] <chairmancaleb> @DJRunol Guess they wanted to innovate. 



[16:46] <encelor> buy that extra console 

[16:46] <cresstheangel> why doesn't phil fight the phylakes that are in his level range? You get guarenteed 
legendary equips from em 
[16:46] <encelor> Kappa 

[16:47] <superbatcat> On the pc i get 55fps and i have a machine that will play it on max settings 
[16:47] <vaidolive> Why I can’t use Chat Only? 

[16:47] <the_elusiveone45> That's why PS3 exclusives looked so much better than ps3 multiplats 
[16:47] <electricspitgaming> :Z 

[16:47] <xkeysx97> what's better ps4 or Xbox one I've had an Xbox one but recently got rid of it a while back 
and can’t decide what one I should get need help 
[16:47] <burakkuauto> member Killzone? 

[16:47] <bammbino> @CressThe Angel the mid life system shit pisses me the fuck off. i know we dont want the 
consoles to last 8 years, but come on 3 years after release and you sell the same system but a bit better? 

[16:47] <encelor> i member 

[16:47] <bethemadeagle> i member 

[16:47] <martyl3612> can this game just end already lol 

[16:47] <the_elusiveone45> Xbone X is the most pointless console in the world. 

[16:47] <bethefueg> Lol youa€™re character can get super armor lol 
[16:47] <bammbino> @martyl3612 its VERY long 

[16:48] <dylannw> Watch Dogs 2 on PS4 it's pretty good to be honest, seems like AC Engine still sucks balls on 
console 

[16:48] <docmaximus> Phil dona€™t play that shyyyt Straight OG son lrnao a€oeUbisoft fuck were you thinking 
hahahaa€ f| 

[16:48] <encelor> @BeTheFueg you are? 

[16:48] <martyl3612> Tell me about it @Bammbino 
[16:48] <vendatus> it isn't pointless LUL 
[16:48] <dooley258> Xbox one x is killing the pro 
[16:48] <burakkuauto> too bad, armor is useless in this 
[16:48] <martyl3612> what part is phil on aproximetly lol 
[16:48] <bethemadeagle> dont start console wars 

[16:48] <bammbino> i’d but the xbox one x variant of the ps4.. not the ps4 pro tho 
[16:48] <bethemadeagle> please 

[16:48] <cresstheangel> yeah @Bammbino the pro and xbone x are just giant wastes of money. If i can play the 
damn game thats all i care about. I won’t judge another person on how they wanna spend their hard earned dollar 
tho 

[16:48] <burakkuauto> unlike previous ACs 

[16:48] <the_elusiveone45> Xbone X is better than the Pro, but not significantly better. 

[16:48] <bethefueg> Honest grammar mistake @encelor 
[16:48] <bammbino> "4k ps4" MY ASS it barely hits 1440p 
[16:48] <xkeysx97> Xbox it is lol 

[16:48] <the_elusiveone45> It's not as good as when digital foundry first revealed the specs, lmao 
[16:48] <encelor> sllverSheriff 

[16:48] <dooley258> Buy the pro for exclusives and xbone x for multiplats 
[16:49] <vaidolive> So what? 

[16:49] <martyl3612> Or buy neither 

[16:49] <the_elusiveone45> There's no reason to buy a Xbone X. Just get a gaming PC 

[16:49] <xkeysx97> and get a pc lol 

[16:49] <bammbino> @The_ElusiveOne45 true 

[16:49] <nightbot> Golden Colts just tipped $2.50 

[16:49] <bethemadeagle> sooley exactly both are great for own reasons 

[16:49] <dylannw> nobody cares about xbox x, people want cheap consoles that plays the same games LUL 
[16:49] <dooley258> Therea€™s a reason if you have a 4 K tv with hdr 



[16:49] <kinggoken> your right @Dylannw 

[16:49] <vendatus> hm course the sonypony bethe says not to start a console war 

[16:49] <thiccbwoii> @The_ElusiveOne45 well xbox one x is the easily the better console but ya pc obv best 
[16:49] <cresstheangel> honestly with how gaming is going nowadays, i think with just a ninty console and PC 
would be just fine for me 
[16:49] <vendatus> Kappa 

[16:50] <the_elusiveone45> If you don’t own a PS4 or Xbone X and want to play 4K gaming without caring 
about niche exclusives, go ahead and get an Xbone X. 

[16:50] <encelor> 4k aint even real 

[16:50] <burakkuauto> it doesn't matter what system we play, we’re all gamers 

[16:50] <chairmancaleb> Niche exclusives? CmonBruh

i dont need upgrades 

[16:50] <thiccbwoii> @The_ElusiveOne45 lmao shut up dumass

[16:51] <the_elusiveone45> @@ChairmanCaleb PS4 has loads of Japanese games that don't appeal to the 
mainstream. That's what I meant.
