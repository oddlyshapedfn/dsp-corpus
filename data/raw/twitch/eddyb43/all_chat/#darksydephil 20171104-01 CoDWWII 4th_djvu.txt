[12:54] <hankhillpropanegod> Hello dsp tdogRat tdogCoin 

[12:54] <chocolaterampage30> @DarksydePhil i dont know how true it is but i heard destiny 2 lost 70% of its 
player base already lol 

[12:54] <hankhillpropanegod> Did I hear micro transactions tdogRat 
[12:54] <kittyspank> kids nowadays only want the current fad 
[12:54] <georgetdawson> he playing multiplayer or campaign? 

[12:54] <slayer_l l_king> Destiny is boring now once you complete the raid and get good gear 

[12:54] <quantumquinn> The Lobby also shows off peoples cosmetics which will make the sheep want to buy 

their Microtransactions 

[12:55] <tynall0192000> @georgetdawson Campaign today, multiplayer later tonight 

[12:55] <hobbsl017> destiny just remade the same game 

[12:55] <georgetdawson> thanks 

[12:55] <georgetdawson> dont have sound 

[12:55] <thenewfaceofcreation> Lame campagin 

[12:55] <hankhillpropanegod> Is he on PS4 or pc tdogTrigger 

[12:55] <thenewfaceofcreation> Wau dood 

[12:55] <elenaarboria> I dont know why people are against more movement options. How is it worse when you 
can double jump, wall run etc... 

[12:55] <slornkersflornkers43> People still care about COD why? 

[12:55] <tynal 10192000 @HankHillPropaneGod PS4 
[12:55] <kittyspank> doesnt he hate pc 
[12:55] <elenaarboria> SLIDE! 

[12:56] <digitaljeff051 > lol duties 

[12:56] <slornkersflornkers43> Play, you can't hold up a tournament. Where am I playing?! You still haven't told 
me?! 

[12:56] <tynall0192000> I like this COD campaign 

[12:57] <thenewfaceofcreation> @Slornkersflornkers43 oh wow 

[12:57] <sockafock> more movement options is generally good but seems out of place for ww2 game 
[12:57] <bionich00t> Phil enjoying this game? 

[12:57] <kittyspank> they shoulda added jetpacks 
[12:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> The single player sucks 

[12:58] <quantumquinn> try double jumping in RL guys let me know how that goes 5Y‘»5Y~f 
[12:58] <masterxeon2002> hey @DarksydePhil do you not upload pre-streams anymore? 

[12:58] <fatestayjedi> just checked on howlongtobeat, apparently the guy is right and campaign is around 7hours 

[12:58] <tynal 10192000 @DarksydePhil The campaign is 6 to 7 hours long from what I heard 

[12:58] <fatestayjedi> co op zombies hype PogChamp 

[12:58] <katexo234> zombie mode SeemsGood 

[12:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> Forget single player 

[12:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> Play multiplayer 

[12:59] <domips4> hype 

[12:59] <elenaarboria> @sockafock Yeah but people talk like if previous CODs sucked because it had those 



extra options. Also they could at least keep (or add? lol dunno dont play CoD) sliding...best inovation new 
shooters came up with in last decade if you ask me. 

[12:59] <lvlpower> zombie zombie time 
[13:00] <blackpinkpro> when is the game starting? 

[13:00] <sardarkh> Never 
[13:00] <fl5664> luptime

[13:00] <thenewfaceofcreation> @BLACKPINKPRO after 50 mins

[13:01] <ningen_sama> daylight saving 
[13:01] <fl5664> Fall back 

[13:01] <deepdrive3254> well daylights savings time is good for the farmers 
[13:01] <tynall0192000> I really love the story in this CoD 
[13:01] <fatestayjedi> americans and their crazy ideas 
[13:01] <quantumquinn> the end of the world?? 5Y‘» 

[13:02] <rx93gundamm> dspWowdude 

[13:02] <sardarkh> It allows you to avoid wasting some electrocity 

[13:02] <thenewfaceofcreation> @tynall0192000 its lame 

[13:02] <tynall0192000> @TheNewFaceofCreation Well, there are opinions.... 

[13:02] <astrojetboy> Here in the UK it ended last Sunday at 2:00am 
[13:02] <ningen_sama> hawaii and arizona dont change time 
[13:02] <thiccbwoii> lol this game fucking sucks 

[13:02] <rx93gundamm> Phtil that means you have an extra hour to do patreon plugs 
[13:03] <sardarkh> Soon he’ll say that the metric system is flawed 

[13:03] <elenaarboria> Yup in EU it already happened. THIS IS LIKE TIME TRAVELING! 

[13:03] <amplifrequency_> "technically" a business 
[13:03] <thenewfaceofcreation> @tynall0192000 guess so 
[13:03] <darthradovanviking> the russians did away with the stupid time 
[13:03] <darthradovanviking> at least one thin putin got right 
[13:03] <atlastelamon9> Last week 

[13:03] <beardtendies> doesnt it make the am-pm revolve more around the sunrise during the winter? 

[13:03] <tynall0192000> @DarksydePhil EA announced UFC 3 for February 2018 

[13:04] <deepdrive3254> he also bought trump vidar 

[13:04] <sardarkh> Well, that's countries not accpeting some standards 

[13:04] <fl5664> Evening daylight lasts an hour longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times SeemsGood 
[13:04] <thenewfaceofcreation> @tynall0192000 he wont play it 

[13:04] <kittyspank> i think we should have longer months in the summer and shorter in the winter so that the 
weather is better for more time of the year 

[13:05] <solid_fantasy> cheer40 What are your thoughts on the campaign so far? Looking forward to the streams 
today 

[13:05] <chairmancaleb> @ki tty spank, O.o 
[13:05] <hs21ee> lol 

[13:05] <sardarkh> @Kittyspank This year has been an eternal summer 
[13:05] <deepdrive3254> not quite how it works kittyspank lol 
[13:05] <kittyspank> <3 
[13:06] <mksushi> Kitty that makes zero sense 

[13:06] <amplifrequency_> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper 
[13:06] <sardarkh> Daylight saving time detractor 
[13:06] <tynall0192000> I spawn, I die 

[13:06] <beardtendies> daylight savings time works the opposite of what i thought it is stupid 



[13:07] <fl5664> those were the days 
[13:07] <tynall0192000> Thugs on da floor 
[13:07] <deepdrive3254> it was better pre google era 
[13:07] <fl5664> true 
[13:08] <airhead793d2jsp> eggplant. 

[13:08] <winderfiend764> Platformers 

[13:08] <katexo234> daylight savings is perfect for me I get to sleep an extra hour 
[13:08] <sardarkh> when life was simpler. Money, fame, ass. 

[13:08] <quantumquinn> YouTube went down the drain very quickly they literally unmonetize all the viddo 
game footage 

[13:08] <katexo234> @deepdrive3254 KonCha 

[13:08] <deepdrive3254> :D nice kate. Good for me since I have to work tommorrow

[13:10] <sardarkh> Darn 

[13:10] <mksushi> What does the text on the shirt and mug say 
[13:10] <tynall0192000> Dang 
[13:11] <kekon3> alliteration 

[13:11] <fl5664> 5pm is actually 4pm, so you have more daylight to drive home from work, i like it. SeemsGood 

[13:11] <mooseman935> Play the game already ReidentSleeper 

[13:11] <sardarkh> Still 3 hours to go 

[13:12] <beardtendies> @fl5664 wouldnt you have less?

[13:13] <dspfandood> Marathons ResidentSleeper 

[13:13] <winderfiend764> Dark Purple name on a dark purple background. Barely saw it.

[13:13] <quantumquinn> manhunt is a little boring to be fair 
[13:13] <tynall0192000> Santa Phil:) 

[13:13] <beardtendies> Sunrise and sunset will be about 1 hour earlier on Nov 5, 2017 than the day before. There 

will be more light in the morning. @fl5664 

[13:13] <dspfandood> yes yes 

[13:14] <mksushi> But people voted for it 

[13:14] <thenewfaceofcreation> @QuantumQuinn he raged tho. 

[13:14] <fl5664> @beardtendies oh! so is it Spring Ahead that adds more light in the evening? 

[13:14] <katexo234> Drunk Santa Phil 

[13:14] <beardtendies> @fl5664 yeah it should be the other way round 
[13:14] <deepdrive3254> imo youtube playthroughs are just as good delta 
[13:14] <tynal 10192000> fallout 3 :) 

[13:14] <sardarkh> I don’t think that alcoholics help health issues

[14:09] <thiccbwoii> true applian master race kill all androggers 

[14:09] <timeddiscovery> Regarding historical accuracy in multiplayer: wouldn’t it be possible to have swastikas 
and historically accurate forces (ie no Germans wearing white helmets with a US star!/no black women 
incongruously serving for the Nazis on the Western Front etc) as an option that you could select (with the 
SJW-friendly, non-contensious censorship as the default to avoid any possible offense)..this could work much in 
the same way that you can select to change the Nazi voices from English to German.

boxes of snacks from overseas.

drive.
