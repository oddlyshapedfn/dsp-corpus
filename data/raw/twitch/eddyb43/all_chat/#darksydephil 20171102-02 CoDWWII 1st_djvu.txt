Session Ident: #darksydephil 

[18:13] <jack_spartacus> cheerlO you know what should be on psn so more folks can play it? Killing Floor 2! 
[19:23] <sirnoblex> hello anyone there? 

[19:24] <thatanonybear> yea 
[19:24] <sirnoblex> hi 

[19:26] <thatanonybear> im just waiting until CoD WW2 lol 
[19:26] <thatanonybear> and nitw is updating :( 

[19:27] <sirnoblex> dspFun 

[19:27] <thatanonybear> 27 minutes 

[19:27] <thatanonybear> how bout you noble? 

[19:30] <sirnoblex> Same, just waiting for COD. 

[19:32] <heelpower> Phil,Phil,Phil,Phil! 

[19:32] <thatanonybear> yep, i already had dinner, just relaxing the next hour 

[19:32] <thatanonybear> im gnna try streaming nitw once it updates but idk how that'd go 

[19:32] <heelpower> Disappointed..Wish the halloween games weren't bad 

[19:33] <heelpower> the halloween marathon kinda fell through 

[19:33] <thatanonybear> i nom’d Call of Cthulhu, i take full responsibilit there :P 

[19:33] <heelpower> actually the last bit with phil trying to jump across was pretty funny 

[19:34] <sirnoblex> Yeah 

[19:34] <thatanonybear> true, that section was what mad erne nom it, but it's so long to get to it 

[19:35] <heelpower> I had never seen call of cthulu before...I am surprised that outlast games pretty much copy 

this 

[19:35] <heelpower> outlast seems HEAVILY inspired by call of cthulu 

[19:36] <thatanonybear> outlast 2 in particular has moments basically taken from Call of Cthulhu 

[19:36] <heelpower> yup 

[19:36] <heelpower> the door locks 

[19:37] <heelpower> in general they just are 

[19:37] <thatanonybear> nitw is completely original for a horror game at least 
[19:37] <thatanonybear> outlast 2 is a good game, but generally uninspired 
[19:37] <heelpower> I am currently playing Evilwithin 2..chapter 1 l..kind of meh 
[19:37] <heelpower> The first one was better... 

[19:38] <heelpower> I just don't see myself ever replaying Evilwithin 2..Evill was much more replayable 
[19:39] <thatanonybear> i can see that, altho i appreciate EW2 more as a piece of horror, EW1 may be the better 
game 

[19:40] <thatanonybear> the way theyre structured, EW1 lends itself to replaying 
[19:40] <heelpower> EW1 was jankier but it had so many little neat and weird set pieces 
[19:40] <thatanonybear> EW2's a Hllywood production 

[19:40] <eldeadmariachi> THANK YOU! HeelPower im glad tho see I'm not the only one that thinks EW1 was 
better. 

[19:40] <thatanonybear> yea 

[19:41] <heelpower> Why would I ever want to run around that open world again... 

[19:41] <heelpower> and stealth is borked 
[19:41] <nich2440> broked? 

[19:41] <thatanonybear> it's no splinter cell: chaos theory 
[19:42] <nich2440> can we have borked be an offical word now? 

[19:42] <eldeadmariachi> @thatanonybear Btw have you seen Chad? He sorta dissapeared 
[19:42] <thatanonybear> Bork Lesnar 

[19:42] <thatanonybear> @elDeadMariachi he went to freedom chat, and then someone with a Cherdy was 

briefly in chat today 

[19:43] <thatanonybear> JDCherdy iirc 



[19:43] <heelpower> I still have my copy of EW1..but I might sell EW2..it sucks because I wanna support the 
game..it sold poorly 

[19:44] <nich2440> wait how much longer til the stream? 

[19:44] <eldeadmariachi> @thatanonybear Hmm I don't remember see him. I watched the entire stream 
[19:44] <thatanonybear> 45minutes 
[19:44] <nich2440> well shit 

[19:44] <thatanonybear> @elDeadMariachi i def same the name, they even changed it to purple like ya cherdy 

[19:44] <nich2440> see you later i guess 

[19:44] <heelpower> so how long have you guys known phil ? 

[19:44] <eldeadmariachi> @heelpower I don’t think is that bad. EW2 is a good survivot game but not good sequel 
[19:45] <nich2440> since heavy rain 

[19:45] <heelpower> I never actively participated in the community but I've been watching since maybe late 2011 
[19:45] <nich2440> his 10 year anniversary is next year. 

[19:46] <heelpower> @elDeadMariachi its a good game for sure 
[19:46] <eldeadmariachi> I been following his since 4/nov/2011 
[19:46] <heelpower> I can't believe the madness that phil had to go through 

[19:47] <thatanonybear> i came to the twitch first on july 4th this year, but been watching since 2013 
[19:47] <heelpower> so ridiculous...I am glad I kept myself away from all that 
[19:47] <nich2440> @elDeadMariachi You're a sonic fan aren't you? 

[19:47] <heelpower> There's just something uniquely fun about phil's style of gameplay 

[19:48] <eldeadmariachi> Cool in 2 days is my anniversary of watching for 6 days SeemsGood 

[19:48] <thatanonybear> LUL 

[19:48] <eldeadmariachi> 6 years 

[19:48] <thatanonybear> that makesmore sense lol 

[19:48] <eldeadmariachi> @nich2440 I do like sonic but waht do you mean 
[19:49] <nich2440> sonic generations was released on November 4th 20122 
[19:49] <nich2440> 2011 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> whoa 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> nich is astute 

[19:49] <eldeadmariachi> @heelpower Yeah he's the reason why I started to watch Yt mor constantly he's the 
reason why I make a yt account well my first 
[19:49] <thatanonybear> that's fucking incredible 
[19:49] <nich2440> Nah I just looked it up 

[19:50] <heelpower> @elDeadMariachi Yup Phil is just a lot of fun...Glad soK is dead for now 
[19:50] <eldeadmariachi> Yeah Sonic Generations is my all-time favorite soni well so far 
[19:50] <thatanonybear> i dont care what people say behind your back nich, youre a good guy 
[19:50] <nich2440> I was trying to figure out what playthrough got him hooked 
[19:50] <eldeadmariachi> But the first video I watched of Phil was Saints Row 3 inauguration station 
[19:50] <nich2440> thanks ;) 

[19:51] <heelpower> Phil got me into Souls series..His intial Dark Souls 1 playthrough is like non other 
[19:51] <thatanonybear> im gonna stream nitw if anyone cares, dsp isnt setup to host me 
[19:51] <eldeadmariachi> I created and account becausei remeber saying like " I like this guy I wanna se more 
fos hi videos" 

[19:51] <nich2440> i don’t 

[19:51] <nich2440> :P

[20:07] <eldeadmariachi> DUTIES! Hype 
[20:08] <nich2440> i've always hated the duties joke 
[20:08] <nich2440> it got old after 2 years 
[20:08] <eldeadmariachi> [schedule 

[20:08] <nightbot> Nov. 2:1 return to streaming with Super Mario Odyssey at 12:30pm PDT! Then it's the 
premiere of COD WWII at 8:30pm PDT, 2 hours of fun multiplayer! 

[20:16] <eldeadmariachi> 46,666 Followers 

[20:22] <darksydephil> who's ready for some COD action? 

[20:23] <darksydephil> okay, settle down, stop getting all excited 

[20:23] <nich2440> unlike SMO I don't plan to play COD so I can watch the stream! 

[20:23] <darksydephil>. 

[20:24] <nich2440> hey phil what is the war mode like? 

[20:24] <darksydephil> oh yeah, let me check muxy quick and see if it says anything about patreon 

[20:24] <sofiarayne> hi 

[20:24] <sirnoblex> Hi @DarksydePhil 

[20:24] <eldeadmariachi> Hi Phil HeyGuys 

[20:25] <darksydephil> nope, i dont get this at all 

[20:25] <darksydephil> why allow me to link my patreon if it doesn’t actually do anything with it lol. pretty lame 
[20:25] <darksydephil> wassap guys, going live shortly 
[20:25] <nich2440> does it track new pledges tho? 

[20:26] <darksydephil> it tracks nothing 
[20:26] <nich2440> if so you can just read it 
[20:26] <nich2440> that sucks 

[20:26] <darksydephil> theres nothing anywhere in it that has any data on patreon, lol 
[20:26] <darksydephil> it allows you to link patreon and thats it 
[20:26] <darksydephil> makes zero sense, mayb ethey'll implement it in the future 
[20:26] <elipsion> Hello hello

[21:26] <ragegamingl24> the A.I knows how to drop shot watch out 

[21:26] <heelpower> its funny how Kevin spacey was actually in a COD 

[21:26] <doctorzzz> what does a russian gun do in the normandy 

[21:26] <neospartanhesperos9> why is it here though, i guess German's took manufactured guns from the russians 
[21:26] <thatanonybear> Kevin Spacey isnt in this, theres not enough rose petals

[21:26] <fl5664> @HeelPower oh yeah, forgot about that!

[21:27] <hobbsl017> not all claims on spacey are proven 

[21:27] <autismmaster69> what can i say KEvin spacey did what he had to do 

[21:27] <romethedrone> what did Kevin Spacey do? 

[21:27] <encelor> @bruceybruce29 nah

[21:27] <popsicolo> He tried to 

[21:27] <drilbit777> He apparently was a diddler 

[21:27] <goldencolts> he molested a 14 year old boy when he was 26 

[21:27] <encelor> "raped" 

[21:28] <hobbsl017> @ThatAnonyBear lmao no thats not the claim at all 
[21:28] <nolbert87> KISS dspShock dspShock dspShock dspShock 
[21:28] <garrickkthegreat> rapped* 

[21:28] <encelor> the kid prolly threw himself at kevin for his money 
[21:28] <hobbsl017> no the kid didnt eben say that 

[21:28] <justinandersonmanderson> Is anyone else having trouble with the servers? 

[21:28] <bruceybruce29> I agree I mean look what Kobe got away with 

[21:28] <hobbsl017> spacey wanted to sleep with him 

[21:28] <hobbsl017> but he let the kid leave 

[21:28] <fluttershyl970> i was in the kiss army 

[21:28] <thatanonybear> he just wrawdogged the child a lil 

[21:28] <heelpower> I mean lets be honest..American beauty openly sexualizes an underaged girl for the 
viewer...its a pretty disgusting movie but ppl praised it 

[21:28] <neospartanhesperos9> nobody even knows the full story yet i dont think, lets not be so quick to make a 
conclusion 

[21:28] <shega_ace> the man said that Kevin invited him for a party but only the boy showed up and then he 
tried to mount him 

[21:28] <joshypew> how are into it is he? 

[21:28] <thevietnamesecomrade> Hello 
[21:28] <baddyrio3000> mount him lol 
[21:28] <fl5664> please no Kevin Spacey talk WutFace 

[21:28] <thatonemissingramenshrimp> American Beauty was a good film though in it's camera work and colors 
[21:28] <encelor> i bet the kids who was being doinked by kevin was all the parents fault hoping to get that 
money 

[21:28] <chairmancaleb> @hobbsl017 more like the kid walked out on his own and kevin tried to talk him into 
staying. 

[21:28] <hotel44> this is first chapter i think 

[21:29] <drilbit777> American beauty is a really well made film 

[21:29] <sweatybackwheelz> The Ref was his best work 

[21:29] <hobbsl017> @ThatAnonyBear u have it all wrong, the story was when he was 25 he tried to sleep with 
that 14 year old he asked the kid if he wanted to but the kid walked out and spacey kind of still tried pressing him 
but then let it go kid left 

[21:29] <shega_ace> but yeah i agree better not talk about it instead let's talk about how bad D-Day was 
[21:29] <fluttershyl970> i painted my face like ace freely

[21:39] <fl5664> PogChamp 

[21:39] <sensfan42> War never changes boys 

[21:39] <encelor> character build started with the start of the game where everyone was getting shot by the nazi 

bu nk ers you can empetize what fear they went through 

[21:39] <syckiopz> Cod campaign is always the same thing 

[21:39] <thepunisherfrankcastle> He said the N word. :0 

[21:39] <thatanonybear> gnat zees 

[21:39] <goldencolts> unkillable player character LUL 

[21:39] <nolbert87> YAAAAS

[21:39] <goldencolts> he just got shot like 30 times 
[21:39] <fl5664> grab the actual mounted gun 
[21:39] <doctorzzz> well he is on normal 

[21:39] <drilbit777> Cod needs good campaigns so they don't get stale. Cod 2 had a great campaign 



[21:39] <neospartanhesperos9> you'd be dead if it were veteran mode 

[21:40] <thatanonybear> if this started with being reqcruited and trained with these men, it'd be so much more 
effective 

[21:40] <nolbert87> dspSurpriseddsp the N word...that whole vid is now unusable 
[21:40] <encelor> well since there are WWII survivors with many kills on their belts 
[21:40] <clunkyd> and they say TLOU 2 is violent, smh 
[21:40] <sgt_woomy> Mmm. Veteran mode. 

[21:40] <doctorzzz> did that nade just bouce of a haystack 

[21:40] <dukaduka> I remember in the Battlefield 1 intro where you were like 5 different people who died LUL 
that was harsh 
[21:40] <fl5664> there 

[21:40] <thatanonybear> but they those you striaght into combat and expect you to cry over npcs 
[21:40] <burnout26> CoD Finest hour is good 

[21:40] <tormentedmayhem 17> Finally, I've had enough of the double jumping wall running BS. 

[21:40] <rockumentary> is this veteran? 

[21:40] <drilbit777> That's kinda how ww2 was like, death everywhere 
[21:40] <rockumentary> veteran or gtfo 

[21:40] <bruceybruce29> this part would be so insane on Veteran 

[21:41] <rockumentary> veteran purist 

[21:41] <sgt_woomy> War. War never changes.

[21:55] <dukaduka> @QuantumQuinn nazis are an easy target (like zombies) 

[21:55] <goldencolts> the game is just easy 

[21:55] <encelor> @QuantumQuinn its nothing new WWII games where populair back then its also now 
[21:55] <doctorzzz> he is on pretty easy 

[21:55] <solid_fantasy> I can't grade it until the game over , it's just my initial impression

[21:56] <rockumentary> wow theres actual health kits like old medal of honor, just noticed that lul 

[21:56] <goldencolts> i got PTSD from playing overwatch, i will never be the same 

[21:56] <sgt_woomy> @homaml234 I played Manhunt when it came out and I turned out fine. 

[21:56] <drilbit777> I would like a ww2 game that has you through the perspective of nazis. I think it'd be 
interesting 

[21:56] <homaml234> did you know fps game cause brain damage 
[21:56] <shega_ace> maybe it's Vaffe? 

[21:56] <cheekyfries> FOV in this game is horrible 

[21:56] <doctorzzz> i wish they would do a cod compaing totally firpm the german perspective 

[21:56] <shega_ace> no L 

[21:56] <rockumentary> i heard that's a myth 

[21:57] <burnout26> U mean play as the nazi 

[21:57] <rockumentary> brain damage myth 

[21:57] <thatanonybear> COD Modern Warfare gave me PTSD, No Russians :( 

[21:57] <encelor> @Homaml234 it only damages the brain if you only play shooters with damage they mean 

one part of your brain gets stimulated while the other is unused 

[21:57] <rockumentary> they took the nazi flags out of the campaign right? 

[21:57] <quantumquinn> Phil has the sexiest fans 
[21:57] <jaymart2k> not enough wall running 
[21:57] <concretecasket> cool idea dr z 



[21:57] <drilbit777> Did you know that overwatch is the smash bros of fps 
[21:57] <encelor> so mix of puzzle +shooters wont damage 
[21:57] <encelor> or rpg instead of puzzles 
[21:57] <drilbit777> @rockumentary only MP 

[21:57] <gramanotsee> cheer 10 Its called the waffle coz the body looks like a waffle after shooting with it. 
[21:57] <syckiopz> Take no prisoners Phil !

[21:57] <rockumentary> ah@Drilbit777 

[21:57] <drilbit777> It’s so that Germans could be able to play online it's everyone. 

[21:57] <homaml234> encelor yeah i think it also changes breathing as well

[22:26] <dukaduka> I call upon the power of Super Mario Sunshine 

[22:26] <encelor> i still dunno who kevin spacey is or how he looks 

[22:26] <sgt_woomy> You dont play Splatoon with a flamethrower. 

[22:26] <kingofhypocrisy> I remember the blops 1 and mw2 having more interesting campaigns 
[22:26] <dukaduka> @encelor old white guy with an aggressive villain like round face 
[22:26] <thiccbwoii> enigma codes they have thsoe in wolf 2 

[22:26] <thevietnamesecomrade> @Sgt_Woomy there is no flamethrower in Splatoon 
[22:26] <kingofhypocrisy> this is so generic 

[22:26] <encelor> @dukaduka sounds like every old hollywood men 

[22:26] <zahvone> It's funny, because the campaign is a perfect reenactment of the staff over at sledgehammer 
trying to fix the servers right now LOL

[22:28] <kingofhypocrisy> it's sniper elite again whhhhhhhhhhoooooooooooo 
[22:28] <encelor> like the story pacing seems to fast 

[22:28] <johny_alumni> This is so weird how is tmart online?? This is fishy af 
[22:28] <encelor> waw felt like a whole movie 

[22:28] <dukaduka> @KingOfHypocrisy I think they toned it down after all the controversy just to sell it better 
[22:28] <encelor> WaW 

[22:29] <encelor> this feels like a 20minute amater movie 
[22:29] <blackpinkpro> Will COD ever take a year off? 

[22:29] <encelor> amatuer 
[22:29] <encelor> amateur 
[22:29] <encelor> however you spell it 

[22:29] <sgt_woomy> Remember on WaW when you got a specific Deck Card, it'll let you play using paintball 
bullets instead of real bullets? 

[22:29] <dukaduka> CoD won't stop until it releases an AC Unity, a game so bad it's unplayable 
[22:29] <thevietnamesecomrade> @BLACKPINKPRO no I guess 
[22:29] <kingofhypocrisy> ResidentSleeper 
[22:29] <sgt_woomy> Call Of Duty World at Woomy there. 

[22:30] <chairmancaleb> So I guess Activision wasn’t afraid to put the Swastika in the game? 

[22:30] <blackpinkpro> I picked up Unity a year after release, it was pretty decent by that point haha 
[22:30] <encelor> why would they beafraid? 

[22:30] <encelor> its part of history and buddist symbole 

[22:30] <thatanonybear> activision execs probably have swastika tattoos

[22:30] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, Because near the beginning, there were constant reports saying they 
removed it from the game in order to be PC. 

[22:30] <kingofhypocrisy> Pretty stupid it's still controversial after all these years 
[22:31] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb oh no clue they said that 
[22:31] <ragegamingl24> fuck my ears

[22:31] <sgt_woomy> cheer20 Hey Phil. Remember in World At War there was a cheat to use paintballs instead 
of bullets? Hope they do that here to play actual Call of Woomy.
