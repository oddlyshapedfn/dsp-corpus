[13:29] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil when some remix is playing. Could you put the guys name who

[13:29] <sardarkh> Content claim 
[13:30] <korewasugoi> cahpyright striked 
[13:30] <jetset3000> its not really remixes tho 

[13:30] <datruuf> That person is immediately going to get spammed by trolls, I can almost guarantee it. 

[13:30] <hindae> I think mashup is more accurate? I dunno 
[13:30] <jetset3000> a remix of what track then? 

[13:30] <thenewfaceofcreation> Ask phil 
[13:30] <jetset3000> hehe 

[13:30] <datruuf> "Wow you made Phil a remix, what a fucking loser." For real bruh? 

[13:31] <midnight_strike_force> no you do it 
[13:31] <korewasugoi> Jebaited 

[13:31] <thenewfaceofcreation> When did they say that @DaTruuf 
[13:31] <jetset3000> who? 

[13:31] <bethebaby> I'm sorry, but nothing will ever top "I Spawn, I Die", and "Thugz On tha Flo." Top DSP 
remixes. 

[13:31] <thenewfaceofcreation> Ask the streamer 
[13:31] <datruuf> Hypothetical scenario. Kappa 

[13:31] <datruuf> But knowing the people that follow DSP, it's not something I wouldn’t expect. 

[13:32] <nich2440> Hey Phil instead of variety streaming you should stream in the real talk community 

[13:32] <jetset3000> i could make Phil an original track 

[13:32] <skooma_dealer> ...this msuic i cant

[14:36] <datruuf> It's a matter of business, honestly. I don’t blame them for trying to get money. The problem 
comes in when you build your game specially around selling DLC and microtransactions 
[14:36] <super_slade> @bruceybruce29 I can still hear them groaning 'zug zug’ 

[14:36] <prettyrikii> chahrahtehrs

[14:38] <scoopula> @matrixman92 star cards only reduce cooldowns and extend range, they never increase

[14:40] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 

[14:40] <scoopula> @matrixman92 No, I'm saying the game mode was never intended to provide a far playing

[14:43] <scoopula> @KingJezal There was a recent report about employee abuse that just came out. 

[14:43] <datruuf> No, what you don't do is build your game around the sales of them. There's no problem with 
having lootboxes. Take overwatch for example. 

[14:43] <chairmancaleb> @Skooma_Dealer People don't realize that there's a lot more that goes into video game 
developing these days compared to back then.

[14:45] <jmon_1985> companies will always try to get as much money as they can

[14:46] <optionalsuperboss> Gacha laws incoming., probably 

[14:46] <mrjekylll6> Bungie wanted a clean state for D2, so everything that got improved during D1 has been

[14:48] <kmark7> @stunted good point 



[14:48] <jmon_1985> you always get something for your money, playing the lotto you dont always get 
something 

[14:48] <chocolaterampage30> @DarksydePhil i heard they are shutting dowb marvel heroes so anyone who 
spend money in that game are fucked 

[14:48] <forautoa> But Overwatch lootboxes are a great way to do loot boxes, imo. Pure cosmetic, no advantage. 
[14:48] <katexo234> do you know 24k magic jimbob? 

[14:48] <trihard41iife> @datruuf calm your fingers won't get you anywhere, you're right though, besides 
Belgium banning loot boxes isng true either, it's misinterpreted headlines 
[14:48] <thatanonybear> so the Bethesda Creation Club? 

[14:48] <pcgamehunter> Like 97% of mobile games use lootboxes. There are very few that are solid games for a 
price up front 

[14:48] <bethemadeagle> just the way you are 

[14:48] <tupakaveli> They'll see the products (iten) individually 

[14:48] <theycallmejimbob> can't say I know all of his songs katexo234 and I don't know that one :D 

[14:48] <datruuf> That doesn't make it gambling. No more than me buying a pack of fucking gummy worms and 

not getting all the blue and pink ones. Kappa 

[14:48] <scoopula> That's not gambling, gambling is risking money on the chance that you will get nothing from 

it, if you buy a loot box you always get something

[14:49] <kozatof> @theycalhnejimbob is Kate your gf 

[14:49] <chairmancaleb> @MountainDewSlayerz If lootboxes are considered gambling, then I guess we better 
ban all those card pakcs for yugioh and pokemon then? 

[14:49] <mountaindewslayerz> Valve has always been the worst with it

[14:49] <taymanicel234> they could make new cosmetic like Dota 2 every couple of months 
[14:49] <thatanonybear> you can't do that with Lootboxes 
[14:49] <encelor> @Skooma_Dealer yes bae 

[14:49] <bruceybruce29> I'm so happy people are shitting on nba 2k this year 

[14:49] <forautoa> But making it purely cosmetic gives no advantages to players who pay and players who don’t.

[14:49] <kekistanifieldofficer> How the fuck did the americans get the news about belgium anyway all they did 
was investigate but never released their statement 

[14:49] <pcgamehunter> We underestimate what percentage of gamers are actually adults, its way more than 
most people think. Games aren’t for small kids 

[14:49] <scoopula> Also it's called Capitalism, if you don't like it don't buy it, it's called freedom

the same model for LITERAL YEARS in real life

[14:50] <tourwithme> Hawaii will always go against anything in the mainland U.S 
[14:50] <kovorus> Australia bans everything SwiftRage 
[14:50] <pray4rock> Ita€™s the same 

[14:50] <thatanonybear> @scoopula the government prevents the sale of many tiems. Alcohol at certain times of 

the day, for instance. Children can't gamble in casions 

[14:50] <aproxymate> I have never paid for die in mobile games 

[14:50] <thatanonybear> Free markets still have limitations 

[14:50] <pcgamehunter> Australia only did this because they're generally fucking close minded to anything 
involving new media and internet 

[14:50] <taymanicel234> spending money for mobile game tf 
[14:50] <thatanonybear> Its not all free 

[14:50] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @mountaindewslayerz at least Valve gives you the option to buy/sell items 
on the steam market. Blizzard gives you fuck all 

[14:50] <chairmancaleb> @MountainDewSlayerz Huh? It's great logic? The company should have the freedom 
to do what they want w/ their product and the consumer should be able to vote w/ their wallet? 

[14:50] <datruuf> I'm a grown ass man, I don't need anyone to protect me from myself. 

[14:50] <scoopula> @ThatAnonyBear They shouldn’t, it's called personal responsibility

[15:53] <datruuf> Yeah, let’s move on to the next game. OpieOP 

[15:53] <theastonmartin> Just bought it. 25 bones at Best Buy 

[15:53] <darkone667> level 90 fucking 6 

[15:53] <vashyoyo> Bethesda marketing sucks 

[15:53] <super_slade> Get in the robot, Shinji!! 

[15:53] <secretbossfight> I like Overwatch lootboxes, they do a LOT to motivate me to play more. But in a 
single player campaign? Naw, bruh, naw. 

[15:53] <beatlesl2335> phil’s wrong here imo, fuck loot boxes 

[15:54] <pcgamehunter> There is nothing adult about either not buying something you dont support or buying it 
for what is and ignoring its flaws, its entirely based on your character ... 

[15:54] <mountaindewslayerz> @beatlesl2335 He never said Loot Boxes were good 
[15:54] <provenmac> Ariana Marie 

[15:54] <drptolemy> shadow of war was a really good game with the 3 act, they thrown an extra bone with act 4, 
whats the problem 

[15:54] <drildo_baggins> black and white mentality TableHere 
[15:54] <mummymama> Nina Hartley's the shit 
[15:54] <halomanlegend98> they put the real ending behind a paywall 
[15:54] <halomanlegend98> how is that not fucking scummy 
[15:54] <scruffshark> It’s not though/ 

[15:54] <kinggoken> lol porn star 
[15:54] <iconicmasterl> FailFish 

[15:54] <scruffshark> You can still beat the game without lootboxes. 

[15:54] <halomanlegend98> but just ignore it because dsp told you to lol 
[15:54] <encelor> @Super_Slade no there must be angsty filler first sllverWut 
[15:54] <kovorus> black and white mentality of a child dood 

[15:54] <dyno36_> DarthRadovanViking its called being sarcastic buddy, like i care about identity politics 
[15:55] <lastkryptonian94> @drptolemy People boycotting the game hurt his views on that playthrough 
[15:55] <mountaindewslayerz> @ScruffShark Yeah it takes forever though 
[15:55] <darthradovanviking> to bad i don’t like acidic sarcasm 

[15:55] <beatlesl2335> i know but thats giving the game leeway, it was put in there/ its a bad practice, so it 

should taint the game imo 

[15:55] <bethemadeagle> i didnt buy it 

[15:55] <midnight_strike_force> Evil Within 2 looks a bit dull to me. 

[15:55] <datruuf> DSP really doesn’t get "casual" viewers 

[15:55] <hitecspecs> Really loved EW 2.1 enjoyed the open world elements too. 

[15:55] <vashyoyo> all Bethesda marketing sucked 

[15:55] <scruffshark> That's just how post game content works then. 

[15:55] <drildo_baggins> boycotting terrible practises is black and white mentality 
[15:55] <pcgamehunter> Why am still allowed to be here then vidar Kappa ? 



[15:55] <datruuf> most of the people that watch him have been following him for a long time 
[15:55] <drptolemy> yeah probably 
[15:55] <kinggoken> Keepo 

[15:55] <scruffshark> I remember how collecting all the shit in a game gave you a picture saying good job. 
[15:55] <drildo_baggins> where are the shades of grey with terrible business practices? 

[15:55] <bethemadeagle> vidar so you dont like me im a walking sarcastic chatter 

[15:55] <encelor> @Vashyoyo bethesda relied on his modding community to advertise for them LUL 

[15:56] <iconicmasterl> I saw commercial of evil within 2 

[15:56] <paddingtonbearl87> YEAH VIDAR WHYs pc still allowed here 

[15:56] <pcgamehunter> my pH is positively sour Keepo 

[15:56] <mountaindewslayerz> @ScruffShark I should get post game content for just beating the game 
[15:56] <vashyoyo> prey, evil within 2, Wolfenstein 2 all sold horribly cause of horrible Bethesda marketing 
[15:56] <paddingtonbearl87> LUL 
[15:56] <bloopme> LUL 

[15:56] <mountaindewslayerz> Also your comparing doing a game 100% and just beating the game, those aren’t 
the same thing 

[15:56] <kinggoken> !uptime 

[15:56] <drildo_baggins> south park is fucking junk and so is marvel 
[15:56] <bethemadeagle> i didnt buy wolfensteing or evil within 2

[15:57] <hitecspecs> @Vashyoyo That is Bethesda's biggest issue. They think their name alone is all the 
marketing they will need because of online media. Not true.

[15:57] <encelor> did phil fight morgan free man?

[15:58] <mountaindewslayerz> Games during the 5th and 6th gen had the best difficulty curve, not Nintendo 
Hard but also not made for Casual Scrubs

[15:59] <scoopula> @TriHard4Liife The game literally says the difficulty had no bearing on comba 
[15:59] <midnight_strike_force> Sure, it doesn't actually affect combat, but it was still quite a good joke. 
[15:59] <nokia6275> double jump or plan

[16:00] <bethemadeagle> HOW DARE YOU 

[16:00] <scoopula> @TriHard4Liife Yes, that does not affect combat 

[16:00] <mountaindewslayerz> Tying the difficult to a character trait is a stupid idea, even for a commentary, I 
should be able to be black while only playing on Normal, not restricted to hard 
[16:00] <midnight_strike_force> @TriHard4Liife it's joke 
[16:00] <trihard41iife> Jesus lol

doesna€™t affect combat

[16:02] <mountaindewslayerz> @scoopula Which is stupid, I don’t give a damn if its a political commentary or 

not, don’t force me to make the game harder just because I wanted to make a character that is black

[16:08] <scruffshark> Forces was bad. 

[16:08] <wubegg> game is 3 hours long at least LUL 
[16:08] <ratchefanl2> WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

[16:08] <mountaindewslayerz> The fact that I can’t make Sonichu or Coldsteel made the game horrible 

[16:08] <bethemadeagle> pc you cant even tell gordon yet 

[16:08] <paddingtonbearl87> CUCKLES 

[16:08] <scruffshark> The music? You mean dubstep remixes? 

[16:08] <mummymama> GRANDIOS 

[16:08] <bethemadeagle> but i know gordon hates me AGAIN 

[16:08] <211 trill> any 3d sonic game with no chaos garden is a bad sonic game 

[16:08] <dukaduka> the music was alright OpieOP lets not get crazy 

[16:08] <midnight_strike_force> Music wasn't that great. Only a few good tracks. 

[16:08] <bethemadeagle> never can satisfy him 
[16:08] <super_slade> But could you go fast? 

[16:08] <control lerhog> sonic team is full of retards 

[16:09] <ahwasblahking> Did he already revealed the big secret? 

[16:09] <kushiyakitori> no 

[16:09] <drildo_baggins> I am honestly stunned anyone anyone gives a shit about sonic. It's the most 
cringeworthy shite 

[16:09] <darthradovanviking> I like jontrons take on sonic team 
[16:09] <midnight_strike_force> @ahwasblahking Not yet 
[16:09] <stinkinburrows> big secret? 

[16:09] <mummymama> his secret is stashed in his close 

[16:09] <mountaindewslayerz> Sonic Games, even the bad ones, tend to have really good music 
[16:09] <beatlesl2335> Mania > Forces 
[16:09] <mummymama> jesus 

[16:09] <211 trill> @drildo_baggins so is your name but you dont see me complaining LUL 
[16:09] <unquietmist> At least Sonic mania was good. 

[16:09] <mountaindewslayerz> Sonic 06 has one of the best soundtracks ever, and the game is fucking shit 
[16:09] <dukaduka> @drildo_baggins it's a classic video game with classic fans. It will never die. 

[16:09] <masonp75> Sonic should have died after sonic 06 
[16:09] <mummymama> why is phil still talking 

[16:09] <scruffshark> Didn't Jontron mention there was a pedo that used to work with Sonic/Sega Team. 

[16:09] <bloopme> that doeant sound apealing Kappa

[16:09] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> gt sport? BlessRNG 

[16:09] <211 trill> yo @MountainDewSlayerz have you tried that mountain dew holiday brew yet? 

[16:10] <mountaindewslayerz> @ScruffShark Billy the Sex Offender was a joke, the guy's name isn’t even Billy 
[16:10] <kittyspank> the hardest part of being a pedo is fitting in 

[16:10] <dukaduka> every single player game now has to have an overproduced story NotLikeThis 
[16:10] <mountaindewslayerz> @a/~a/ a a/«211 No, never even knew that was a thing 

[16:10] <djrunol> phil talking about racing games is like me talking about fighting games, you punch, you do 
combos, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, same suff all the time. 

[16:10] <suckasurprise> AND the Wookies are OP 
[16:10] <211 trill> @MountainDewSlayerz it just came out 
[16:10] <scruffshark> But there was a wiki page about it.

[17:07] <scruffshark> The IRS is responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing of the Internal Revenue Code. Its 
role is to help the large majority of compliant tax payers with the tax law and make certain those who challenge 
the law still pay their fair share. The IRS, in some form or another, has been around a long time.

within the state that provides services. Your business is virtual.
