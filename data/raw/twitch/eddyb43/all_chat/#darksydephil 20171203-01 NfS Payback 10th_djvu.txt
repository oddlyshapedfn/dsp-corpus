[11:53] <thenewfaceofcreation> @jackwhite202 you joking right :p 
[11:53] <vendatus> you know what's a bad game Uncharted ResidentSleeper 
Kappa 

[11:53] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[11:53] <jackwhite202> @TheNewFaceofCreation obvious sarcasm bro :P 
[11:54] <bethemadeagle> ea just put their name on mass effect, need for 
speed and battlefront they didnt make em but its still their fault 

[11:54] <link_im_not_zelda> EA vs. Konami and capcom who would win 

[11:54] <majinboo3> Konami doesnt even make games anymore lol 
[11:54] <sardarkh> "cooking" 

[11:54] <majinboo3> they retired 

[11:54] <frogsonic> remember when everybody hated Ubisoft? 

[11:54] <thenewfaceofcreation> @jackwhite202 when i put :p. that means im 
j oking 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> they made the game devs rush out broken games 
[11:54] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[11:54] <allntzz> Drink some energy drinks to buff your abilities Kappa 
Kappa Kappa 

[11:54] <link_im_not_zelda> did They announce it yet? 

[11:54] <freischutz2> who would have thunk that game companies are out to 
make money 

[11:54] <link_im_not_zelda> They tried to make their own metal gear last 

I payed attention to them 

[11:54] <jackwhite202> for a while konami was the worst game company out 
there 

[11:54] <freischutz2> really gets the noggin a joggin 

[11:54] <link_im_not_zelda> not that that is gonna live 

[11:54] <jackwhite202> now they are tied with EA 
[11:55] <sardarkh> @freischutz2 "thunk" 

[11:55] <majinboo3> Konami didnt do anything that every other japanese 
company does 

[11:55] <a_lern> @freischutz2 what gets noggins a joggin? 

[11:55] <jackwhite202> is metal gear survive still a thing? 

[11:55] <freischutz2> i dont repeat myself 
[11:55] <freischutz2> especially in text form 

[11:55] <frogsonic> Konami stopped making video games though and started 
making slots 

[11:55] <majinboo3> In japan they expect you to put in work and if you 

dont your fucked 

[11:55] <vendatus> yup Jack 

[11:55] <a_lern> damn, I was hoping you'd repeat yourself 



[11:55] <freischutz2> no 
[11:55] <jackwhite202> damn 
[11:55] <a_lern> argh 

[11:55] <bethemadeagle> the publishes cuck the actual game devs and this 
is the problem, if the publishers just waited until the game devs were 
ready then all would be good but nooooo they put a damn due date and the 
game devs need to rush out the fucking game ugh 
[11:56] <jackwhite202> konami should just cancel MG Survive 

[11:56] <link_im_not_zelda> A see they're still alive Kappa 

[11:56] <freischutz2> its an asset flip of MGSV 

[11:56] <jackwhite202> and sell the Metal Gear rights to Sony 

[11:56] <freischutz2> what the fuck is taking konami so long to make it 

[11:56] <frogsonic> yeah it looks hilariously bad 

[11:56] <allntzz> WutFace 

[11:56] <vendatus> there should be a new trailer for it at psx LUL 

[11:56] <majinboo3> Im sure Nintendo is just as bad they are just very 

secretive when it comes to that

[11:56] <tantamounter> cheerlOO 

[11:56] <majinboo3> they just lowkey shady 

[11:57] <frogsonic> Disney is rumored to be buying Sony Entertainment 
[11:57] <glitch_crazed> Phil should do a Disney Marathon Kappa 
[11:57] <freischutz2> if dsp hates this game why doesnt he play super 
mario sunshine instead lol 

[11:57] <link_im_not_zelda> I mean Nintendo makes games at least

gets the noggin a joggin!

[12:00] <theycallmejimbob> if you message one of the mods Glitch_Crazed 
they'll post the link for you

the games and sicussing game news and stuff, but keep your personal life 
off the internet because the detractors milk that stuff for negative 
videos

expensive

@DarksydePhil 

[12:02] <link im_not_zelda> if you tell the internet your life story it 

can and will be used against you if you contradict it Kippa tbh that's a 
good call 

[12:02] <majinboo3> all these internet trolls were regulated to 4chan 
where they will the outcasts of the internet but now being a troll is the 
popular thing 

[12:02] <markrodriguez09> 4chan/anon happened 

[12:02] <8bitassassintv> phil is living the American dream imo 
[12:02] <theycallmejimbob> NITW hype VoHiYo

messed up 

[12:03] <theycallmejimbob> Okami HD hype VoHiYo 

[12:03] <a_lern> a sabbatical until the 11th 

[12:03] <allntzz> American dream needs children....no??? 

[12:03] <bethemadeagle> yep 

[12:03] <link_im_not_zelda> being a "troll" is not the same as doxzing 

and swatting we call that being a prick where I'm from Kappa 
[12:03] <markrodriguez09> no, phil is living the millenial dream 
[12:03] <majinboo3> honestly you should need a mental exam to use the 
internet 

[12:03] <bethemadeagle> ugh fuck pubg fuck it FUCK IT 

[12:03] <theycallmejimbob> Phil's gonna be playing playerunknown dspShock 
[12:03] <bethemadeagle> FUCK OKAMI

[12:04] <glitch_crazed> Svendatus did they announce the release date yet? 

[12:04] <m_e_d_i_c_b_a_g> time off to clean eggs detractors threw on 

your house 

[12:04] <bethemadeagle> no pubg and no okami just do resident evil and 
nothing else 

[12:04] <vendatus> bethe sipping that Haterade LUL 

[12:04] <link_im_not_zelda> @majinboo3 are you sure about that people 

are different on the internet than they are IRL LUL 

[12:04] <markrodriguez09> Phil will be too busy using that tongue for 
other things, yo 

[12:04] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe BetheMadEagle why you gotta be like 
that 

[12:04] <link_im_not_zelda> if you believe that you may need a mental 

evaluation yourself Kippa 

[12:04] <kovorus> Psychical cmonBruh 

[12:04] <a_lern> Phil should put compression on his mic, so he doesn't 
have to expend his vocal power on long streams. 

[12:04] <sardarkh> Finish the year in a "strong" way 

[12:04] <majinboo3> oh i know that which is why nobody has tried to do 
anything to phil irl 

[12:04] <majinboo3> because his trolls are real life pussies 
[12:04] <vendatus> no release date yet glitched 

[12:05] <theycallmejimbob> Playerunknown will be hilarious BetheMadEagle 
if it's anything like the fortnite PT 

[12:05] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil 9 hours of talking? you sure 
about that man? 

[12:05] <bethemadeagle> ven i dont like okami or pubg, pung is boring and 
okami is rubbish 

[12:05] <a_lern> is Phil doing the end of year stuff like he usually 
does?? I love that stuff 

[12:05] <allntzz> I would say Phils sucking the lemons of life, hope they 
are juicy ones 

[12:05] <link_im_not_zelda> Kippa "trolls" that do what exactly? 



[12:05] <glitch_crazed> @vendatus damn 

[12:05] <majinboo3> ive never played okami but i hear its good 
[12:05] <vendatus> bethehater 

[12:05] <majinboo3> it has alot to do with japanese mythology so get 
ready for his asian jokes LOL 

[12:05] <theycallmejimbob> he'll be doing a countdown of his top 10 games 
of the year a_lern 

[12:06] <bethemadeagle> ven i dont hate i just dont like 

[12:06] <a_lern> @theycallmejimbob after the break, or after the new 

year? 

[12:06] <majinboo3> He will rage on pubg 

[12:06] <vendatus> how is Okami rubbish? it's fucking Zelda you pleb LUL 
[12:06] <majinboo3> its much harder then fortnite 

[12:06] <a_lern> Stheycallmejimbob and it sounds like not funniest 
moments, so that sucks 

[12:06] <bethemadeagle> okami is zelda AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH 
[12:06] <glitch_crazed> Only episodic release this month so far is 
rumored to be Minecraft. But you are skipping that. Think there might be 
Episode 3 Of life is Strange though 

[12:06] <link_im_not_zelda> yknow vendatus is kinda right 

[12:06] <suckasurprise> I'm really looking forward to the Christmas IRL 
stream 

[12:06] <markrodriguez09> I bet Phil's new gal will be much better for 
him than Leanna. 

[12:06] <bethemadeagle> zelda is good okami isnt 
[12:06] <qqnbu> Hi Phil, thank your for being you. 

[12:06] <a_lern> funniest moments, Phil? 

[12:07] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil will persona 5 will be in 
the best games? 

[12:07] <blue_blur64> not this year lern 

[12:07] <trihard41iife> @MarkRodriguez09 dspFacepalm 

[12:07] <glitch_crazed> I'm looking forward to the Christmas marathon, 
and WWE sims 

[12:07] <blue_blur64> And P5 can't be @TheNewFaceofCreation 

[12:07] <majinboo3> he cant 

[12:07] <vendatus> Okami > BOTW LUL 

[12:07] <thenewfaceofcreation> @blue_blur64 why 

[12:07] <majinboo3> P5 might get the video copywrigted 

[12:07] <theycallmejimbob> he said no one posted any funny moments on the 
forum so he wasn't going ahead with it a_lern iirc 

[12:07] <blue_blur64> He hasn't beat the game so it wouldn't be fair 
[12:07] <majinboo3> he cant take the chance 

[12:07] <link_im_not_zelda> Kappa in a sense the abilities are similar 

you use the right one to do the things. Also I, a zelda fan, find that to 
be a weak ass argument 

[12:07] <blue_blur64> plus the copyright questions 

[12:07] <thenewfaceofcreation> i guess 

[12:07] <a_lern> Stheycallmejimbob aaahhhrrrgghhh! 

[12:07] <ajern> lol 

[12:07] <theycallmejimbob> calling it now dishonored death of the 
outsider will be his worst game of the year 

[12:07] <glitch_crazed> @a_lern he's not doing a funniest moments this 
year, he forgot to plug it a lot that it never really got any attention 
[12:08] <a lern> SGlitch Crazed eff 



[12:08] <bethemadeagle> just googled okami and it looks rubbish lie i 
thought 

[12:08] <blue_blur64> Persona 5 would obviously be on the list so just 
treat it as whatever number 10 is would actually be an honorable 
mention :P 

[12:08] <link_im_not_zelda> especially bosses. Kippa USE THE RIGHT ITEM 

YOU JUST GOT TO BEAT THE BOSS, why do we play zelda? because I don't 
think it's for the boss fights alone 

[12:08] <theycallmejimbob> Redemption run hype VoHiYo 

[12:08] <link_im_not_zelda> "zelda is good okami isn't " -> "Just 

googled okami" Did you never see okami before making that statement 
[12:09] <vendatus> Bethe you're rubbish LUL 

[12:09] <thenewfaceofcreation> normal goal is ok. but 2000$ is way too 
much 

[12:09] <link_im_not_zelda> I'm actually asking 

[12:09] <a_lern> stretch that goal -- stretch it wide!! 

[12:09] Ctheycallmejimbob> ;) ;) 

[12:09] <m_e_d_i_c_b_a_g> who would like to see Philoo play Payday 2 

[12:09] <bethemadeagle> no i never saw okami i dont like it 
[12:09] <markrodriguez09> why is emote chan s black dude 
[12:09] <jackwhite202> The Last Jedi Hype 

[12:09] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil will you do 1 difficulty 
above normal in MGS 

[12:09] <majinboo3> i want to see the rematch against the end 
[12:10] <theycallmejimbob> I think every 5 levels it changes to a 
different twitch emote MarkRodriguezO9

[12:10] <link_im_not_zelda> ok but calling something bad that you've 

never touched is foolish, literally all you gotta say is I think the game 

looks boring and shitty Kappa @bethemadeagle 

[12:10] <majinboo3> aka 1 part end

graphic style 

[12:10] <vendatus> so you never saw it played and don't like it? that 
makes total sense damn EU logic Kappa

[12:11] <a_lern> save the clock tower! 

[12:11] <glitch_crazed> TBH I can only think of 4 Christmas games Phil 
could do for the Christmas marathon 

[12:11] <tourwithme> asking for 2k though, kinda steep though.. 

[12:11] <link_im_not_zelda> you said "zelda is good okami isn't" with no 

basis of personal thought. I assumed you had played the game

the shelves and jumping up and down as their parents cash in their 
fucking food stamps. Whatever isn't stocking up on basic foods is fucking 
whiskey, cigarettes and other things they can sell out of packet. Is why 
I don't go to Wal Mart anymore

[13:01] <imzakanoury> you should only roll chidori parts they have a set 
bonus that gives acceleration and braking 
[13:01] <bionich00t> and it's quite cheap

[15:18] <kjones4140> Says this game yas 

[15:18] <majinboo3> is that leanna? 

[15:18] <bethemadeagle> i never liked oreos 

[15:18] <darthradovanviking> salt and sweet can actually be a very nice 
flavor if it's done right 

[15:19] <friendlyflame2> ay dpsp is u fin paly dat new blodbrone 
[15:19] <bammbino> i just dont get why phil always tries to tackle 
enemies that are above his level/progression in ALL his games when it 
only causes him frustration 

[15:19] <kjones4140> Salyt french fries in a milk shake. 

[15:19] <allntzz> Salt and sweet is peanut butter right? 

[15:19] <katexo234> I remember Skittles had chocolate flavor Skittles 
dspEw dspEw 

[15:19] <allntzz> Its a combo used in america 
[15:19] <kushiyakitori> thats the shortcut you took before

[15:20] <bammbino> you LOVE IT 

[15:20] <i_came_here_to_something> Remember: Shortcuts in racing games 
are bad, kids. Guess San Francisco Rush is a bad racing game (it isn't)

[15:20] <krowsader> LUL 

[15:20] <kushiyakitori> you saw this part of the track already and saw 
them heading that direction too 

[15:20] <plagueweilder97> @DarksydePhil drive slowly so you dont crash 
[15:20] <kinggoken> San Francisco Rush was awesome 
[15:20] <ashligast> Why blame the game for your driving?

[15:20] <segregate> xDD 

[15:20] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil upgrade this trash car! spend all of 
your ingame money 

[15:21] <talionshadowll38> doesn't the mini-map tell you about shortcuts? 
I remember previous NFS games do that 

[15:21] <kinggoken> is dsp only doing one stream tonight 

[15:21] <kushiyakitori> you passed them when you saw the track the first 
time, even took one of them once 

[15:21] <kjones4140> Put skittles, m&m's and reeses in a bowl 
[15:21] <kjones4140> with BANANAS 

[15:21] <kushiyakitori> and yes, you can also see the road split for a 
shortcut at times on the minimap. it happens during this race 
[15:21] <talionshadowll38> though I was about like 8 years old when I was 
playing the original NFS Most Wanted and reacted just like Phil did 
[15:21] <talionshadowll38> but then again, I sucked back then 
[15:21] <majinboo3> LOL 

[15:21] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Ibanana 

[15:21] <nightbot> ^ Banana Party! ^ No trolls allowed! ^ 

[15:21] <kinggoken> didn't this game get bad reviews? 

[15:21] <i_came_here_to_something> Phil you should try more arcade-style 
racing games b/c many of them usually have shortcuts on their tracks. 
That's part of the fun in them, like the Cruisn' series and San Fran 
Rush, or Crazy Taxi etc 
[15:21] <superslygaming> Hahaha 

[15:21] <allntzz> hey remember Cheetos mac'ncheese on DSP tries it Kappa 
[15:21] <chomchamp> upgrade it phil 
[15:21] <khyrez_2097> pit maneuvered

go through the shortcuts on the first lap 

[15:22] <pinkdam> no you can't borrow the racer in 6th 

[15:22] <kinggoken> ah I see 

[15:22] <alfmonster68> XD 

[15:22] <kinggoken> that is kind of cheap then 
[15:23] <kinggoken> lmao 

[15:23] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kinggoken Not really; the point of 
shortcuts is to give a reward for players who learn the course layout, 
and for speedruns. 

[15:23] <kinggoken> tess got all of that speed out of nowhere 
[15:23] <bammbino> "slighty"

that Phil rages and blames the game. I'm entertained as a viewer, and in 
the end its his stream. Shame about all the trolls. :( Hope some other 
people are here for positive, or at the very least not negative vibes. 
[16:08] <burnout26> nope beat it first try 

[16:08] <shadowx22222> Phil, you're driving straight into trees, cliffs 
and/ or boosting into walls. How do you expect to win like that?

[16:14] <secretbossfight> Rubber-banding does happen in some games, 
though. Mario Kart used to give you a "rival" specific to the character 
you picked who could go above their top speed to always be breathing down 
your neck 

[16:14] <bethemadeagle> bear i like normal kisses the nice wet slob ones 
you do 

[16:14] <bammbino> @burnout26 they should have made this a points based 
thing like in mario kart type games., i.e 2nd place adds X points 3 is Y 
etc

[16:16] <buckrog3rs> ok now its just getting silly lol might as well try 
blindfolded :) 

[16:16] <bammbino> @infinite_55 watch it on YT for some hardcore laughter 
[16:16] <burnout26> @infinite_55 He finished the Runner missions but 
stuck on the offroad 

[16:16] <tourwithme> No, a bored quit is when you're progressing and just 
stop. Like, Okay I'm just gonna quit this game even though I reached the 
next level 

[16:16] <allntzz> more and more viewers...phil is on to something here!! 

[16:16] <holden_mcgroin9> Incredibly badly played too 

[16:16] <rockstar0182> Rage Quit Incoming guys and I dont blame him 

[16:16] <infinite_55> @Bammbino it would seem, lol 

[16:16] <gojirakunpls> wait so like, what happened to Tyler? 

[16:16] <12ksplash68> this is a mix of usar error and a horrible game 
[16:16] <blacktemplar2252> Stourwithme Watch the next time he rages it 
isn't out of anger, it's out of boredom 

[16:17] <allntzz> Actuall isnt this kinda like a reaction video? 

[16:17] <majinboo3> nah it wont be a ragequit it'1 lbe a bored quit 
[16:17] <purple_knight24> Phil you should punch a pillow and pretend its 
a dev to release some stress 

[16:17] <burnout26> tyler doesnt do offroad races 
[16:17] <gojirakunpls> ohhh Okay 

[16:17] <reggieface420> @Gojirakunpls too many crashes and blows to the 
head he has a permanent concussion now they had to sub mac in 
[16:17] <gojirakunpls> Ha 
[16:17] <bammbino> INC 

[16:17] <tourwithme> Well, he'll SAY its a bored quit but.... you know 
[16:17] <i_came_here_to_something> a game making you rage so hard you get 
bored still technically counts as raging, just subdued 
[16:17] <burnout26> Tyler does Race and drag 

[16:17] <darkone667> philly you clearly speed up too much where you 
shouldnt
