[11:51] <octoa> Today's the day! 

[11:51] <thatanonyraccoon> tonight's the night! 

[11:52] <octoa> Ah those TF2 threads were fun 
[11:52] <octoa> how've you been, dude? 

[11:53] <thatanonyraccoon> eh alright, kinda sleepy 
[11:54] <thatanonyraccoon> i cried daily during the break 
[11:54] <octoa> lrnao 

[11:54] <octoa> I ended up just kind of getting new games to pass the time 
[11:55] <octoa> got The Last of Us: Remastered yesterday 

[11:55] <kekon3> Had to do a bunch of school stuff in between so perfect time for a break for me 

[11:55] <kekon3> is the remaster good? never actually paid attention to it 

[11:56] <octoa> I never played the original, so I have no point of reference 

[11:56] <octoa> game's pretty fun, though 

[11:56] <octoa> almost makes me sad I didn’t play it at first 

[11:56] <kekon3> thats good enough lmao 

[11:56] <octoa> ALMOST 

[11:57] <octoa> I also got the Uncharted collection because, Surprise! I"ve never played an Uncharted game 

[11:57] <kekon3> I ended up kinda missing it too 

[11:57] <kekon3> Uncharted games are worth in a bundle 

[11:57] <kekon3> don't even know what the price is 

[11:57] <octoa> I got the first 3 in a bundle for 20 bucks 

[11:58] <thatanonyraccoon> that's a gr8 deal, i hear the Uncharted remasters were incredibly well handled 
[12:03] <kekon3> yeah, delivered with love 
[12:03] <nakedcop> Wherea€™s phil 

[12:03] <kekon3> actually improved the controls for 1, which is good, because if you didn’t play it before but 

you played 2 or 3, you'd be disgusted by vanilla Uncharted controls 

[12:04] <gamemaster2003isdead> hello people how are you today 

[12:04] <kekon3> @gamemaster2003isdead hows it going
