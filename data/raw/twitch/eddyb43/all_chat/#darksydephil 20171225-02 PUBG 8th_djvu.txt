[21:05] <gojirakunpls> Phil, youtube became sjw hell

[21:05] <zahvone> @Popsicolo You have a vr headset? I don't, sadly. It’s actually quite... interesting. 

[21:06] <hoboxl0> it's not truly a visual novel game, that's just part of the illusion 
[21:06] <popsicolo> There was a guy with a Rick avatar who sounded just like Rick. 

[21:06] <zahvone> @majinboo3 Think playstation home? But VR, and super weeby 
[21:06] <neospartanhesperos9> Everyone? That's an over generalization. KappaRoss /

rub my girlfriends Lugia face. LOL 

[21:06] <popsicolo> I might have to upload the footage. 

[21:06] <zahvone> You gotta. 

[21:06] <bfl_griffon> cheerlO the live interaction on twitch helps humanize the streamer and it feels more 

personal, so viewers tend to be more generous. I prefer twitch to youtube 

[21:06] <neospartanhesperos9> it's not alt-right hell either Kappa 

[21:07] <kingofhypocrisy> I liked cookie crisp 

[21:07] <xicestaff> air drop to your east!!

[21:07] <mastersaruwatari> politics have dominated youtube. 

[21:07] <mastersaruwatari> both left and right. 

[21:07] <popsicolo> Oh and there was a Lugia who was groping an anime girl in a bikini. 

[21:07] <kingofhypocrisy> waffle crisp is one of my favorites 
[21:07] <bfl_griffon> cinnamon toast crunch is the best cereal 
[21:07] <katexo234> honey comb cereal is delicious 
[21:07] <zahvone> Oh yeah, that's not uncommon. 

[21:07] <suckasurprise> Phil do you eat Trix cereal or are Trix truly for kids? 

[21:07] <timboslicegb> we have a visiter 

[21:07] <conan_the_barbarian> @Darksydephil are you planning to do another Heavy Rain playthrough? i think

[21:07] <leewanner> I always hated TRIX

on Conan it's hilarious 

[21:18] <sickogrind> I dont like dsp's style of play 

[21:18] <neospartanhesperos9> @Popsicolo or want to know LUL

[21:18] <popsicolo> I think BeThe is in love with her. 

[21:18] <kinggoken> why @sickogrind 

[21:18] <mastersaruwatari> sniping people with a shotgun. 

[21:19] <primernova> That's an old school radar 
[21:19] <superslygaming> sniping with a shotty 

[21:19] <suckasurprise> @DarksydePhil Did you ever see the Norm Macdonald movie "Dirty Work"? 

[21:19] <gojirakunpls> it's possible 
[21:19] <iamtheluckyyo> close range 

[21:19] <conan_the_barbarian> @Zahvone check out some clips on youtube, not sure whether you like that type 

of comedy or not but it is funny as hell for me 

[21:19] <neospartanhesperos9> I thought weapons were RNG? 

[21:19] <little_guy> Resetting everything on my pc? Or do you mean restarting my pc? @mastersaruwatari 

[21:19] <zahvone> in living color? hellll yeah 

[21:19] <sickogrind> Not enough speed violenceand momentum 

[21:19] <mastersaruwatari> @little_guy restarting

[21:19] <ssyc2020> cheer 10 Hey Phil, if you weren't making ad revenue from YouTube would you still be doing 
great content for YouTube? Also, you should snipe with the shotgun, Phil. 

[21:19] <conan_the_barbarian> homey the clown 

[21:19] <dead_kinggamer> phil hold lb when ads u zoom more with red dot or holo 

[21:19] <little_guy> @mastersaruwatari Ia€™ll give it a try 

[21:20] <mastersaruwatari> ok 
[21:20] <heybosspossi> cheer 100 

[21:20] <conan_the_barbarian> IRL section of twitch is a complete wastland lol 

[21:20] <kingofhypocrisy> Snipe with the shotgun? Memories of The End fight lol 

[21:20] <neospartanhesperos9> @DarksydePhil Do you have the most videos uploaded on youtube? 

[21:21] <sickogrind> Irl is free porn 

[21:21] <kinggoken> why did they get demonitzed? 

[21:21] <kinggoken> i spelled that wrong 
[21:21] <iamtheluckyyo> you tube good old days 

[21:21] <conan_the_barbarian> well you can get better porn somewhere else 

[21:21] <leewanner> @DarksydePhil - For what reason were todays videos demonitized?!?! They must give you 
a reason, right - even a bs reason... 



[21:21] <gojirakunpls> Phil, maybe you should just close down your youtube channel, just saying man. 

[21:22] <sickogrind> I have vr porn i love it lol 

[21:22] <gdayguy36> You already made the money in tips anyways so what does it matter if they are 
demonetized? 

[21:22] <nukacolaking> cheer20 Merry Christmas Phil! 

[21:22] <bfl_griffon> @gojirakunpls no reason to do that, it serves as a decent archive and still produces a bit of 
money 

[21:22] <conan_the_barbarian> hey Phil is there any way you can just stream on twitch? and not worry about 
youtube? 

[21:22] <kinggoken> youtube is falling off 

[21:22] <mastersaruwatari> @Gojirakunpls not an awful idea, but then where can we watch his content if we 
miss the streams? They don't stay up forever. 

[21:22] <gojirakunpls> @BFL_Griffon Alright that's true. Forgot that it could serve as an archive 
[21:22] <dead_kinggamer> @darksydephil Phil aim down sights hold lb when ads 
[21:22] <superslygaming> Christmas is offensive to non religeous ppl 
[21:23] <two_bar_king> his voice is just so musical 

[21:23] <emerphish> @gdayguy36 he lost the money from the ads. That's totally unrelated to top money. 

[21:23] <sickogrind> Cylinders 
[21:23] <mastersaruwatari> lol supersly 

[21:23] <kinggoken> is it possible to play the whole game in first person mode? 

[21:23] <zahvone> yes 

[21:23] <superslygaming> BrokeBack 

[21:23] <emerphish> yup 

[21:23] <emerphish> on PC there’s a first person only game mode 
[21:23] <conan_the_barbarian> just give up YT Phil..just stream 

[21:23] <mickjones90> I know some content creators who were able to get videos monetized again by speaking 
to YT staff at YT space events, but Phil doesn’t live near a YT space unfortunately 
[21:23] <succkonlemon> youtube is a jock 

[21:23] <kinggoken> how come xbox doesn't have the first person mode? 

[21:23] <drdisrespectsmistress> YT sucks 
[21:23] <two_bar_king> top 20 

[21:23] <conan_the_barbarian> just stream full time and build up your subs 

[21:24] <bfl_griffon> @gojirakunpls yeah and its not like he edits the videos, so all he really does is title the vids 
and set them to upload. 

[21:24] <mastersaruwatari> @mickjones90 can't believe you have to do that just to get your ads back. Wow... 

[21:24] <emerphish> Imo no reason to give up youtube if it doesn't require any investment to keep uploading 
[21:24] <its_me_ten> @kinggoken it does 
[21:24] <kinggoken> oh 

[21:24] <superslygaming> youtube is just gonna ve makeup tutorials and cat videos one day 
[21:24] <huntingowlgames> cheerlO is it bad i drank a litre bottle vodka 

[21:24] <mastersaruwatari> i think phil should remove ads and start doing copyright deadlock similar to what 
Jim Sterling did. 

[21:25] <bfl_griffon> @huntingowlgames by yourself? 

[21:25] <conan_the_barbarian> how many subs do you need to stream full time on twitch? 

[21:25] <gdayguy36> They aren't the supreme court, they are youtube and they have to protect thier business. 

[21:25] <kinggoken> youtube falling off hard 

[21:25] <superslygaming> its all algorithm bots 

[21:25] <huntingowlgames> @BFL_Griffon indeed bud 

[21:25] <elzorrobot> I would get the high ground if I were you Phil 

[21:25] <emerphish> There not violating law. They are going to win the ruling. They can do whatever the hell 
they want with their own websites. 

[21:25] <bfl_griffon> @huntingowlgames probably lol. surprised youre even typing properly 



[21:25] <mastersaruwatari> youtube is similar to the anime industry. 

[21:25] <huntingowlgames> cheer20 ah well it was a good xmas 

[21:25] <neospartanhesperos9> @HuntingOwlGames You won't be able to absorb Thymine Pyrophosphate for a 
month NotATK 

[21:26] <huntingowlgames> im cute 

[21:26] <iamtheluckyyo> some gaming youtubers i like but three of them not there for money 
[21:26] <a7x_nightmare> rover8HWG 

[21:26] <amplitory2> cheer20 Game looks like ghost recon 2001 and runs like homefront the revolution. 

[21:26] <michizzle> i refunded this game after 36 minutes, this game is super overrated... 

[21:26] <kinggoken> lol 

[21:26] <clunkyd> youre not shoenice 

[21:26] <bfl_griffon> phil is right if you really did drink that much 
[21:26] <bfl_griffon> drinking is fun but be safe 

[21:26] <conan_the_barbarian> back when Phil started there weren’t too many lets players, but now there is 
WAY too many of them 
[21:26] <amplitory2> lol 

[21:26] <mastersaruwatari> @michizzle we need this option on PSN, eshop, and XB1. 

[21:26] <emerphish> How the hell can you call the game overrated if you played it for 36 minutes LUL 
[21:27] <huntingowlgames> cheer 10 its the good stuff had a irish drink thats 90% and im still alive well just 
about 

[21:27] <superslygaming> im a lets player :) 

[21:27] <conan_the_barbarian> YT is oversaturated with really bad lets players 
[21:27] <iamtheluckyyo> go for it phil 

[21:27] <neospartanhesperos9> @HuntingOwlGames Did you collude with the Russians? Kappa 
[21:27] <brotherplaya> dude shoot wtf 

[21:27] <mastersaruwatari> reminder everyone: game developers don't like the steam refund option because they 
think people wil labuse it. 

[21:27] <fluttershyl970> phill's streams this year helped me a through some shitty stuff this year 
[21:27] <huntingowlgames> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 im no trump 

[21:27] <snipertheladiesman> @darksydephil to get off topic... best fighting game girl in your opinion... 
combining looks and personality, mine would be R mika and laura from SFV 
[21:27] <lovelytiming> Yeah true, ever since I became a Social Justice Warrior. But it's true though 
[21:27] <donksy00> damn you play with 0 risk 

[21:27] <michizzle> because im not crazy enough to play a game for 100 hours hating my life, then deciding i 
dont like that game 

[21:27] <emerphish> get behind him and light him up 

[21:27] <hobbsl017> and talked about moving to wash 

[21:27] <bfl_griffon> @fluttershyl970 glad to hear he helped you man 

[21:27] <elzorrobot> I believe! Kappa 

[21:27] <ratchefanl2> @conan_the_barbarian some good lpers like Chuggaaconroy and Nintendocaprisun 
[21:27] <iamtheluckyyo> tree way 

[21:27] <kinggoken> whats da best strategy on this game? 

[21:28] <neospartanhesperos9> @HuntingOwlGames Drinking vodka tho Kappa 

[21:28] <mastersaruwatari> @emerphish it's an online only game. He may have played one game and said not 
for me. If you don't play more than 2 hours you can refund it. 

[21:28] <filthysleezeball> cheerlO are you paying for PPO or HMO for your health insurance? 

[21:28] <brotherplaya> top 10 of not doing anything cmon phil lets see some kills! 

[21:28] <little_guy> @mastersaruwatari windows was unable to format 

[21:28] <emerphish> Then why tf buy the game in the first place if you don’t want to play it??? 

[21:28] <huntingowlgames> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 good point lol 
[21:28] <osterzone_> have you gotten #1 yet phil? 

[21:28] <zylax> @Kinggoken to win 



[21:28] <two_bar_king> chicken dinner time 
[21:28] <kinggoken> lol 

[21:28] <bfl_griffon> @kinggoken realistically dropping in hot spots and practicinf combat 
[21:28] <mastersaruwatari> @BrotherPlaya well it is how you play the game. 

[21:28] <bfl_griffon> @osterzone_ his second gane was a no kill win lmao 

[21:28] <emerphish> I mean if you didn't like it and refunded it that's a good decision but idk why buy it anyway 
[21:28] <amoblivious> top 10 situation 

[21:28] <conan_the_barbarian> seems to me the best way to get top 10 on xbox is not shoot at anyone 
[21:28] <conan_the_barbarian> the best way to go 

[21:28] <mastersaruwatari> @little_guy then i don’t know dude. You should look into returning it. 

[21:28] <neospartanhesperos9> @Kinggoken He's lying. The best strategy is to kill everything 
[21:29] <conan_the_barbarian> let everyone kill each other 

[21:29] <little_guy> Thata€™s prob what Ia€™m gonna have to do. Thanks any way man 

[21:29] <mastersaruwatari> np man 

[21:29] <yolodopper> cheer 10 does smoking pot intoxicate a person or is that something only drinking alcoholic 
beverages can do? 

[21:29] <kinggoken> i do matches where i don't see anyone for like...20 minutes and then get randomly shot in 
the back lmao 

[21:29] <brotherplaya> @MasterSaruwatari sure if ur at home playing alone. When ur streaming you want it to 
be entertaining no? kills make it fun and not repetitive FailFish 
[21:29] <mastersaruwatari> this is evo grand finals. 

[21:29] <neospartanhesperos9> @DarksydePhil 5 is your personal record 
[21:29] <mickjones90> good shooting Phil 

[21:29] <emerphish> The best strategy is to go slow, stay low, and make sure you scout where people are at 
before shooting at all 
[21:29] <elzorrobot> nice 

[21:29] <iamtheluckyyo> whont to see this is how you dont play ubg

[21:31] <iamtheluckyyo> that was good 

[21:31] <kinggoken> xbox doesn't have the kill cam? 

[21:31] <solid_shock7> gg 
[21:31] <bfl_griffon> dspNothing 

[21:31] <captcaveman4201> a good strategy is t o place a jeep with a top on it in a good spot then hide on 
ground next to it. whrn someone hops in you jump in the back and hit them in head with fry pan. 

[21:31] <huntingowlgames> @BFL_Griffon i will lol 

[21:31] <brotherplaya> @MasterSaruwatari why have a gun then if you just need to be passive to win? the whole 
point is to be the last person alive and 99/100 times you need to kill someone in order to do that 
[21:31] <saetur> you getting into the game a little more now despite it's flaws? 

[21:31] <zahvone> @Osterzone_ He won his second or third game without firing a single bullet. No bullshit lol 
[21:31] <suckasurprise> Phil is gonna end up taking Dr. Disrespect's niche 

[21:31] <zybatzuu> Console players need to learn how to hear movement that guy should have heard you and 
shot you from a mile away 

[21:31] <calinks> @DarksydePhil been a lot smarter about when to fight or hide 

[21:31] <osterzone_> lol nice 

[21:31] <gojirakunpls> dspeepee break 

[21:31] <kinggoken> anyone watch Raw tonight? 

[21:32] <calinks> Phil is the new Dr, Disrepect for sure. 

[21:32] <huntingowlgames> is phil drinking 

[21:32] <mastersaruwatari> @BrotherPlaya the game picks people off, so no need to rush in gun blazing. 

[21:32] <petulant_stephen> Piss in the shower

match. 

[21:32] <conan_the_barbarian> lets be honest Phil wouldn’t have a chance to get to top 10 on PC 

[21:32] <mastersaruwatari> PUBG would be unplayable if they didn’t have a enclose circle making you move 

your ass. 

[21:32] <huntingowlgames> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 did u gift sub me the other night 

[21:32] <zybatzuu> It's another world of skill on pc

did that then you would just complain that Phil is too argessive.

[22:25] <conan_the_barbarian> your first PT of that game was great Phil good shit 
[22:25] <hellthurian> Most optimized game NA 

[22:25] <baddyrio3000> All I remember from Phils playthrough of la noire is 'dicks with guns!' lol 

[22:25] <hoboxl0> @DarksydePhil did you hear the version 1.0 version of this game just came out for PC and 

supposedly runs worse than ever 

[22:25] <fluttershyl970> i wonder if phill have censor the nudity like his first playthrough ofla nior 

[22:25] <factorbactorjr> sounds about right 

[22:25] <conan_the_barbarian> i played LA noire on PC 

[22:25] <eclonic> cheer25 also just made it in time to see PUBG crash on you again, great. LUL 

[22:25] <dukaduka> pubg is like your unreliable girlfriend who says this is her last time cheating and they she’s 

"born again" but she always messes up then blames you for her problems FeelsBadMan 

[22:25] <sethl89> @hoboxl0 I'm sorry but you've heard wrong, it runs so much better now 

[22:25] <dukaduka> im drunk ignore me 

[22:25] <hoboxl0> i havent heard wrong lol, ive watched tons of people with the issue 
[22:26] <conan_the_barbarian> remember all the nudity in the game Phil? u worried about that?? 

[22:26] <hoboxl0> for so many people it runs way worse now 

[22:26] <neospartanhesperos9> @dukaduka No, no- keep talking CoolStoryBob 

[22:26] <theonlyjesusmark> the test servers for PC before the 1.0 update ran smooth as ever 

[22:26] <sethl89> Don't know how that's possible honesly 

[22:26] <aragorio> Did his 1000 dollar tip go through? 

[22:26] <theonlyjesusmark> and then the updte comes out and its trash 

[22:26] <factorbactorjr> im fairly certain that on twitch you dont need to censor nudity as long as the game isnt 
actually focused on nudity 

[22:26] <hoboxl0> because the developers are incompetent 

[22:26] <markj78> I want to get this for Xbox but ita€™s still running like garbage 

[22:26] <conan_the_barbarian> remember all the nudity in the game Phil? u worried about that?? 

[22:26] <iamtheluckyyo> a tommy gun 

[22:27] <neospartanhesperos9> @aragorio Yes, or so he says 

[22:27] <pwnage_101> In one of your sessions, the game crashed 4 times as well. 

[22:27] <kingwhiterabbit> cheer 10 Player Unknown is obsessed with the Tommy gun that's why he put it in the 
game, no joke. 

[22:27] <novaenforcer> Lmao thata€™s a Thompson that was used in WW2 

[22:27] <popsicolo> Tommya€™s gunt dspYuck 

[22:27] <plizzat5> tommy gun owns 

[22:27] <succkonlemon> it was a drop gun LUL 

[22:27] <kingofhypocrisy> I wonder what a Philly Gun would look like 

[22:27] <neospartanhesperos9> @NovaEnforcer 4Head 

[22:27] <hoboxl0> game nudity is allowed on twitch as long as it isnt the focus of the game 
[22:27] <litterial> If he pledged that 1000 to patreon, we’d have already hit the goal 
[22:27] <rtucker913> There was a vest right there. Vests give extra space too 
[22:27] <litterial> or almost 

[22:27] <wjr02003> @darksydephil They did change the Truth, lie and doubt options in LA Noire to Good cop, 
Bad cop and accuse so good luck choosing the right options this time. 



[22:27] <bigtone995> Hey guys 

[22:27] <novaenforcer> @neospartanhesperos9 the troll of trolls 
[22:27] <oatscurryguy> @DarksydePhil How's your girlfriend? 

[22:27] <kingwhiterabbit> lol 

[22:27] <kingofhypocrisy> Player Unknown is a stoopid fuckin nudnik 
[22:27] <markj78> Guess they had to push it out to support the X. 

[22:27] <sethl89> Hey big 

[22:27] <kingwhiterabbit> it's true 

[22:27] <mastersaruwatari> Tommy gun so edgy boys! 

[22:28] <spartanwknl 17> Can u enjoy the game and stop complaining 

[22:28] <hoboxlO> yeah the changed options in the new la noire dont make any sense 

[22:28] <neospartanhesperos9> @NovaEnforcer I know, I think a bridge troll best defines me CarlSmile 

[22:28] <mastersaruwatari> @Spartanwknl 17 hard to when the game crashes on like crazy. 

[22:28] <dukaduka> well it's his game that he programmed and he's a millionaire now show laugh at him LUL 
[22:28] <glacierss> like u 

[22:28] <snipertheladiesman> best video game girls... go 
[22:28] <bigtone995> So was that tip legit? 

[22:28] <mastersaruwatari> stumble upon his success? That is Robert Krikman Phil! 

[22:28] <mastersaruwatari> lol! 

[22:28] <plizzat5> mac 10a are dope 

[22:28] <bigtone995> I didna€™t catch most of the stream 

[22:28] <dukaduka> @snipertheladiesman Quiet Kreygasm 

[22:28] <conan_the_barbarian> i rather see him play Heavy rain again 

[22:28] <mastersaruwatari> Krikman is a grade A moron to writing and zombies. 

[22:28] <pwnage_101> @bigtone995 People say it was legit, but not too sure. 

[22:28] <mastersaruwatari> Dude don’t even know how to ed his damn series. 

[22:29] <dukaduka> Donald Trump isn’t a savant, but he's president so does anything really matter OpieOP 
[22:29] <kingofhypocrisy> cheer 10 Why do you always trash the little guys who blow up and make it big like 
Player Unknown and Notch? 

[22:29] <bigtone995> Thata€™s crazy 

[22:29] <glacierss> i mean creating the most popular game of 2017 is stumbling upon success Thinking: 

[22:29] <snipertheladiesman> @dukaduka why barel 

[22:29] <bigtone995> I hope it is tho 

[22:29] <neospartanhesperos9> @dukaduka OpieOP 

[22:29] <factorbactorjr> egoism is a hell of a thing LUL 

[22:29] <kingwhiterabbit> Phil never trashed Notch 

[22:29] <mastersaruwatari> @KingOfHypocrisy to his credit he backpedal on Notch and minecraft. 

[22:29] <snipertheladiesman> barely anyone looks in chat 
[22:29] <kingofhypocrisy> he did back in the day 

[22:29] <hoboxl0> it is stumbling on success considering this is like the 6th iteration of this exact same game 
concept since dayz 

[22:29] <rtucker913> I'm always too scared to play this game because I don’t want my ears blown out out of 
nowhere. I dislike jumpscares 

[22:29] <mastersaruwatari> i mean cuphead wasn't dumb luck. 

[22:29] <popsicolo> Notcha€™s candy wall dspYuck 

[22:29] <dukaduka> @KingOfHypocrisy because they are popular at the right time and have alot of flexibility 
their games. 

[22:29] <mastersaruwatari> it was a gamble by 14 people. 

[22:30] <bigtone995> Wonder if Phil wants to play duos with Patreons 
[22:30] <dukaduka> @snipertheladiesman i like her humming 
[22:30] <neospartanhesperos9> ??? 

[22:30] <skooma_dealer> wew 



[22:30] <eclonic> LUL 

[22:30] <skooma_dealer> does phil consider himself good looking? 

[22:30] <dukaduka> damn phil tell us how you really feel OpieOP 
[22:30] <snipertheladiesman> @dukaduka what!? 

[22:30] <popsicolo> Brown bricks in meincrap dspYuck 

[22:31] <factorbactorjr> i talked to notch in a twitch chat before he got the big money and im like yeaaaaaah i 
dont like like your game at all. and we was actually not an asshole about it, and was like yeah it isnt for everyone 
[22:31] <rtucker913> He stole it from a movie 
[22:31] <mastersaruwatari> he stole the idea from a fucking manga. 

[22:31] <kingjezal> Stolen from Suzanne Collins, duh 

[22:31] <hoboxl0> not just stole it, like 5 games before pubg all did it LUL 

[22:31] <succkonlemon> he took it from a movie 

[22:31] <mastersaruwatari> battle royale was the first to do this. 

[22:31] <hoboxl0> it's a fucking joke 
[22:31] <kingofhypocrisy> He STOLE IT! 

[22:31] <hodortarg> bugged copyright mechanics 

[22:31] <skooma_dealer> phil if you had to rate yourself what would you rate yourself out of 10? 

[22:31] <jesterkl> TriHard 

[22:31] <txstormsurge> HE STOLE IT 

[22:31] <dukaduka> @snipertheladiesman i like quiet's humming, it her one real interesting quality. I don't really 
care for her look, but the humming seems like the eye of a hurricane when looking at her character 
[22:31] <glacierss> @MasterSaruwatari the execution of PUBG is a 7/10 to me thats still not stumbling on 
success 

[22:31] <dukaduka> i get verbose when im drunk sorry 
[22:31] <jesterkl> TriHard mine now 

[22:31] <fluttershyl970> it is like if are not happy poor being rich is not going fix your problems 
[22:31] <glacierss> not perfect a% 0 stumbling on success 

[22:32] <hoboxl0> anna, dayz, hlzl, ark survival... all the same thing, and there's more than just those 
[22:32] <popsicolo> This game reminds me of when I was a foreign exchange student in Japan. 

[22:32] <skooma_dealer> What would you rate yourself out of 10 @DarksydePhil 

[22:32] <mastersaruwatari> @Glacierss I would kind of call it dumb luck. I find something like cuphead's 
success more legit because of how much of a gamble it is. 

[22:32] <dukaduka> but if you create the context to take it out of without elaborating, you kinda shoot yourself 
in the foot preemptively 

[22:32] <factorbactorjr> meh... i just find fortnite to be a more fun battle royale game... 

[22:32] <neospartanhesperos9> @Popsicolo dspPepe 

[22:32] <snipertheladiesman> @dukaduka im the opposite i dislike her humming but like everything else 
[22:32] <rqkai> @popsicolo what was it likr living in japan 
[22:32] <mastersaruwatari> cuphead was such a HUGE risk. 

[22:32] <glacierss> i really disagree, its a flawed execution, i dont play PUBG at all because i hate the 
optimization but if the game ran like it could i would call it a 10/10... agree @factorbactorjr i play fortnite daily 
[22:32] <dukaduka> @factorbactorjr agreed, it just feels more complete 
[22:32] <camnotthecomedyman> So DSP I heard you got a lk tip congrats man 
[22:33] <camnotthecomedyman> or was it fake? 

[22:33] <inphynityy> God this game looks so trash on Xbox 
[22:33] <inphynityy> Jesus Christ 
[22:33] <zylax> 7.5 is good 

[22:33] <popsicolo> @neospartanhesperos9 KappaHD 

[22:33] <glacierss> @MasterSaruwatari it takes some brains to make this game, and some effort, its not 
stumbling onto it at all. getting big on youtube in the youtube bboom is much more stumbling on success 
[22:33] <mastersaruwatari> it was legit @camnotthecomedyman 
[22:33] <skooma_dealer> I wonder if phil likes watching popular you tubers fail 



[22:33] <inphynityy> What is that 15 FPS lmao 
[22:33] <neospartanhesperos9> LLOL 
[22:33] <kingjezal> No!

onto success as a YT’er.. 

[22:34] <dukaduka> @snipertheladiesman i don’t really like her look so much. I think it's ok, but it's nothing 
special. I do like her "queit" way of dealing with people though 
[22:34] <oatscurryguy> @DarksydePhil how's your Christmas? 

[22:34] <camnotthecomedyman> Phil must be having a good day with that lk tip then damn

[22:34] <factorbactorjr> phil is now plagued by the "one more game" virus., we must pray for him in the hopes 
that one day he will snap out of it 

[22:34] <dukaduka> @suckasurprise and then you realize thay although a game doesn’t look super complicated, 
it can still be super addictive 

[22:35] <factorbactorjr> @Glacierss ps4, but i usually play solo 
[22:35] <infinite_55> holidaycheerlOO #charity 

[22:35] <kingwhiterabbit> cheer40 Did that $1000 tip go through that you recieved earlier? 

[22:35] <glacierss> @factorbactorjr yea i do as well but if u want add me for duos man glaciers51 
[22:35] <pwnage_101> If PUBG didn’t have all these crashes and bugs, this would be good on Xbox One.

[22:49] <heybosspossi> lets talk about something positive, how about them Switch sales? 

[22:49] <glacierss> you said pewdiepie has no creativity factually false 

[22:49] <ornightz> Mark seperated himself from felix shadow and so did jack... kinda 

[22:49] <plizzat5> fact attack 

[22:49] <neospartanhesperos9> Someone clip DSP's real talk 

[22:49] <mastersaruwatari> there are so many people o YouTube that got popular talking shit about people. 
[22:49] <dukaduka> "factual observations" 

[22:49] <txstormsurge> Callin him a pussy is a fact? who make more money than you just makes you look 
smaller, petty and insignificant 

[22:49] <skooma_dealer> @WeStreamNoGames you got mocked dat sucks 
[22:49] <dukaduka> an observation in itself is subjective OpieOP 
[22:49] <lymiss> Calling someone a sissy is an opinion not a fact. 

[22:49] <mrsunshinel079> HA! 

[22:49] <fwuffycodbunny> @darksydephil should make a shirt that says"welcome to video game land" 

[22:49] <mastersaruwatari> well he is right about how peedws blew up. 

[22:50] <kushiyakitori> thats the same excuse yout haters wpuld use for you though 
[22:50] <rtucker913> He gives "The Hateful Truth" 

[22:50] <factorbactorjr> im gonna be honest, i am a huge markiplier fan, he is a good dude with a good heart, 
that being said, it is the same shit 

[22:50] <mastersaruwatari> but saying he has n ocreativeity is an opinion and objective as best. 

[22:50] <bentboxer> look at the end of the day phil is a good guy and pewdiepie is a good guy 
[22:50] <stinkinburrows> wait, who's a sissy? 

[22:50] <mastersaruwatari> even though.i agree with him 100%. 

[22:50] <dukaduka> a cross-examined observation backed up with numbers and scholary articles may hold more 
weight though LUL 

[22:50] <oatscurryguy> @DarksydePhil who are your favorite Youtubers? 

[22:50] <brokenheavenii> Pewdiepie. 

[22:50] <glacierss> saying he got popular by being a sissy girl isnt really factually correct in any universe 
@MasterSaruwatari 

[22:50] <novaenforcer> All pewds fans like him for acting like a a€oesissy girla€D [he cant ever be funny 
[22:50] <hodortarg> we need to resummon dramatic chimpmunk so much drama bois monkaS 
[22:50] <glacierss> its quaint 

[22:50] <kingofhypocrisy> cheer 10 I'm surprised PewDiePie hasn’t supported u at all. If I made it big I would

[22:51] <mastersaruwatari> @Glacierss but there is videos breaking down his content and how he got big. Even 
gametheory did a video of how he took over YouTube. The research has been done.

[22:52] <glacierss> @MasterSaruwatari i think the clarification as a "sissy girl with no creativity" is 
intellectually bankrupt... it took a lot more than that
