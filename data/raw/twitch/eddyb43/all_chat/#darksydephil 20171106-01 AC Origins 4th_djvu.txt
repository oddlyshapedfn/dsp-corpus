couldn’t get the rights back! Neener-neener!" -Fox 

[13:05] <cobrastrike09> id say hold off when you have more time 

[13:05] <nich2440> you should call it a first look rather than playthrough and don’t promise to to go back to it 
[13:05] <thatanonybear> NFS is more a fun to play game, than a fun to watch game

[13:07] <popsicolo> Even though he’s done being Logan, Disney should give Hugh Jackman a part in a MCU 
movie as another character.

[15:53] <solid_fantasy> I know no one probably cares, but I still can't believe WB hasn't set up a critics 

screening for Justice League yet. If they don’t at all it must absolutely suck
