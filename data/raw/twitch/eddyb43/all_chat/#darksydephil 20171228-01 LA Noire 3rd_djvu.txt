[11:51] <gabriel_ko> Phil, thinking of buying Watch Dogs 2 Gold for $30 on sale on Xbox one. Is it any good? 
[11:51] <bethelewd> alex hunter sister is hot though for a american 

[11:51] <seezstopbeingafk> cheer 10 Hey Phil, I seen some data where they kept track of all of your tips, cheers, 
patreon, and an estimate of your ad revenue and they said that you make around 90K a year. Is this true? If so, 
how are you in so much debt while asking us to give you even more money? The average salary of an american 
household is closer to 40k a year. 

[11:51] <ornightz> @gabriel_ko it's good I reccemend it

[12:03] <shousan> dont understand how you can't survive on 1000+ dollars everyday. I wouldnt last a week in 

the US with my salary 

[12:03] <vredstein> Didn't he say February? 

[12:04] <thatanonyraccoon> @Vredstein he said AFTER January 
[12:04] <thatanonyraccoon> whenever after 

[12:04] <epicnessunleashedcontent> Did DSP play Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64? 

[12:04] <theycallmejimbob> Rules of a redemption run 1) No spoilers 2) no hand holding 3) no bs 4) no excuses. 
No problem! 



[12:04] <vredstein> That's pretty open, eternity. 

[12:04] <trurockyseez> cheerlO Hey Phil, I seen some data where they kept track of all of your tips, cheers, 
patreon, and an estimate of your ad revenue and they said that you make around 90 a year. Is this true? 

[12:04] <kingofhypocrisy> @theycallmejimbob you know that's not gonna happen Kappa 

[12:04] <masterxeon2002> @DarksydePhil if you play only 1 mgs game please make it MGS 3. The end needs 

introduced to a shotgun again. :D 

[12:04] <ny_atmosphere> You should do hard mode for your redemption run. It would make sense for a 
redemption run and it would encourage more people to pledge.

[12:10] <blurnull> cheerlO Those troll tips are idiots, but if you're really making over 50k a year and have tons a 
debt then maybe it's time to cut back and learn to manage your finances, Phil. How come you just don’t sell your 
house and move into an apartment where it should be much cheaper than living in a community. At least then 
you'll be far more financially secure then living paycheck to paycheck. Love you as a streamer, Phil. I don’t want 
you to go :( 

[12:10] <60inchtelevision> hmm, gonna have to set up a theater in my yard with a 120 inch projector and four 
1600W speakers to prepare for the 10 year anniversary stream. Do any fellow DSP fans have any crazy setups in 
mind for the long awaited 10 year anniversary stream?

[12:23] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Imagine if heavy was the rain was playing during the Kreygasm incident 
instead of the PS4 dashboard 

[12:23] <dingusmasterl> @DarksydePhil can i pledge to patreon or twitch with gift cards 

[12:23] <industrialspaceman> savor the flavor.. HappyJack 

[12:23] <succkonlemon> battlefront 2 is sadly dead game now dspPepe

[12:23] <theycallmejimbob> dspAngrydsp BeTheLewd cahman

[12:24] <derichloveslemur> @thatanonyraccoon How's Your Day Going? 

[12:24] <bethelewd> jim hah 

[12:24] <cherry_dood> Why do tips AND Patreon? I would think dropping tips and pushing Patreon and Twitch 
interaction would lead to more patrons and virtually ensure every goal. Whereas tips are just tips. 

[12:24] <majinboo3> also unlike other elder scrolls morrowind doesnt hold your hand its literally the true 
defintion of an open world 

[12:24] <butter_my_bread> a tenant could of helped with that had u acted immediately 

[12:24] <ggfunky> Paying taxes is dspFun Kappa 

[12:24] <majinboo3> you can go wherever the fuck you want 

[12:24] <derichloveslemur> Hey @butter_my_bread 

[12:25] <thatanonyraccoon> @MasterXeon2002 "WTF I’M STANDING RIGHT BY HIM AND I CAN’T HIT 
HIM!!!" dspCowboy 

[12:25] <60inchtelevision> if phil can beat three dark souls games, he can beat three cases, believe in this 
beautiful man... 

[12:25] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil is an internet villain Kappa 

[12:25] <butter_my_bread> who does fundraising? real talk 

[12:25] <marshmelons> the sok are pathetic 
[12:25] <bethelewd> FUCK MORROWIND 

[12:25] <cherry_dood> just my two cents. Now that Patreon is going to be integrated to Twitch, it seems like 
win-win 

[12:25] <bethelewd> STOP TALKING ABOUT IT 
[12:25] <markmccauley> @KingOfHypocrisy MingLee 
[12:25] <masterxeon2002> 

[12:25] <majinboo3> fundraising stream? 

[12:25] <devkitgaming> what about elder srcolls online 




[12:25] <majinboo3> i mean someone did drop that lk donation

[12:26] <thatanonyraccoon> @Derichloveslemur You'll finally be 14 

[12:26] <majinboo3> His best playthrough was madden 2012 when he almost broke his tv in rage 
[12:26] <ny_atmosphere> What went down with The Sons of Kojima? I've been out of the loop for a while... 
[12:26] <koraea> cmonBruh 

[12:26] <majinboo3> without a doubt the funniest moment of all time 

[12:26] <imphraidofwerk> cheerlO But Phil, other people who fundraise usually raise for other causes. You're 
fundraising for yourself. I think that's what people are mad about that there's kids in New York who are starving 
while you own two houses and can easily fix your situation by selling your house and moving to an apartment 
#charity 

[12:26] <60inchtelevision> Fun Fact: Phil defeated SoK's Moogle in Tekken 7, and he didn’t know it was an SoK 
member. He also didn’t use King or else it would have been easy for Phil. 

[12:26] <bethelewd> coon haha 

[12:26] <derichloveslemur> @thatanonyraccoon Uhh I'm gonna be 16.

[12:26] <dingusmasterl> @DarksydePhil there was one resident evil, 4? maybe — where you made some joke 
after the helicopter pilot died— it was funny as fuck 

[12:26] <katexo234> people complain too much about Phil but they give their money to the YouTubers who do 
the same thing dspHmm

[12:39] <derichloveslemur> Thanks for the warning Phil lol 

[12:39] <bethelewd> jim i cant hear anymore what is phil saying Kappa 

[12:39] <movieswithmark> You could still put the videos up on YT 

[12:39] <hoboxlO> every one of rockstar's games always has shitty unbalanced audio 

[12:39] <markmccauley> and Detroit: Become Human is one of my most anticipated 2018 video games. 

[12:39] <nastytj> @majinboo3 For some people even $1 is too much to spare 

[12:39] <brotherplaya> phil why do you count the hour long prestream as streaming when you dont do any 
gameplay during it 

[12:39] <theycallmejimbob> :D BeTheLewd I had headphones on too 
[12:39] <nastytj> Don't be so disrespectful

[12:39] <ricky23gg> The soothing sounds of la noire

[12:40] <bethelewd> kate la noire 2 might come after red dead redemption 2 since rockstar isnt making anymore 
gta things 

[12:40] <movieswithmark> Considering both YT and Vodcasts would make money, why doesn't he do both? 
That we he could still get bits and support charity while still getting YT revenue. 

[12:40] <butter_my_bread> well DMC5 may be 19 

[12:40] <hoboxl0> you ever thought of going back to buzzing your hair short phil? i miss it personally

[12:47] <thatanonyraccoon> @TheNewFaceofCreation Shaggy - It Wasn't Me 

[12:47] <ny_atmosphere> He should play an actual good Need For Speed he’d enjoy. For example, Most Wanted 
2005 or Carbon. 

[12:47] <majinboo3> if you dont remember back in 2008 when fallout 3 came out 
[12:47] <koraea> who wouldn’t want free matches? 

[12:47] <masterxeon2002> :P

everything to progress yeah their are a few bs moments but are realistic like switching between the people your 
talking 2 in the middle of interrogations etc

[01:44] <infmite_55> streamlabslOO #charity 

[01:45] <infmite_55> streamlabs20 #charity 

[01:45] <me_ree> wow that's a lot of money for charity 

[01:45] <infinite_55> streamlabslO #charity 

[01:47] <infinite_55> Had some leftover bits, so I thought Ia€™d support Phil:) 

[01:48] <me_ree> well he's on the brink of an emergency with everything going on 

[01:48] <infinite_55> streamlabs50 #charity 

[01:48] <infinite_55> Youa€™re speaking now of his tax problem? 

[01:49] <infinite_55> streamlabs20 #charity 
[01:50] <me_ree> tax problem? 

[01:50] <sonowske> meow 

[01:50] <infinite_55> doodlecheerlOO #charity 

[01:51] <infinite_55> What emergency are you speaking of @me_ree 

[01:51] <me_ree> he says he needs a lot of money but I don’t recall him ever showing evidence it was for taxes. 
Only that he really really needs the money, in January. 

[01:52] <me_ree> that's why I was confused 

[01:54] <infinite_55> He said that his previous tax attorney screwed him because he was unfamiliar with 
Washington policies. 

[01:55] <me_ree> but he was never his tax attorney in the past - a friend of his father's, a dean at a college or 
something, who did them, he only became a tax attorney very recently, was just a weird change of phrase to use 
[01:57] <infinite_55> Ia€™m not entirely sure what went down to be honest. I just assumed that is what you 
meant when you said a€oeemergencya€C| □ 

[01:58] <me_ree> every pre-stream we get reminded of it lol 

[02:00] <infinite_55> Ia€™m not always here for the pre-stream to be honest. Anyway, I gotta get some shut 
eye. Peace
