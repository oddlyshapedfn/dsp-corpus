[12:26] <thatanonyraccoon> what the kek 

[12:28] <zencorpl 11> This reminds me of Eddie Murphy Raw when he talks about making burgers better than 
mcdonalds 

[12:29] <rx93gundamm> >using regular bread for a hamburger

[12:30] <bethebaby> I paused this stream because it was buffering like crazy. Sounds like it was a good idea to 
do that, judging by chat reactions. 

[12:30] <thatanonyraccoon> Kekon doesn't want to brag, he doesn’t wanna boast 
[12:31] <nik01ai95> is he going to put a whole tomato on it?

[14:45] <elzorrobot> crapcom is crap 

[14:45] <bootycallme> cheer 100 Hey Phil, I noticed that you still consider Youtube content ID matching your 
playthroughs when you decide to play games with music. Why not just play those games with music like GTA 
San Andreas just on Twitch and not upload those type of playthroughs to Youtube. I think you'll have better 
viewership and participation if you did this. You say you're a twitch streamer but Youtube is heavily influencing 
the games you play. 

[14:45] <wubegg> poor MVCI 

[14:45] <jetset3000> youtube = not street smart 

[14:45] <amoblivious> capcom should hire phil as CEO, he has a business degree

[14:45] <wxrxaxtxh> DOOD 

[14:45] <i_came_here_to_something> See, I can respect his reasoning for skipping SFV AE b/c it’d be a massive 
time sink. B/c it would require a large reinvestment in time. 

[14:45] <skooma_dealer> amazon is fucking big brother 
[14:45] <kekon3> Injustice 2 is cool but I don't take it seriously tbh 
[14:45] <popsicolo> "We're less smarmy than google" -Amazon 
[14:45] <xnalb> LUL 

[14:45] <i_came_here_to_something> But blame Sony for rushing Capcom to release SFV before Capcom's own 
internail 2018 timeline. It's Sony's fault SFV came out in a bad state, not Capcom's.

[15:12] <elzorrobot> now phil is triggered great job ppl 






[15:12] <darksydephil> its this simple, the story is 100% false and theres no facts, at all. just heresay, this twitter 
account claiming something thats blatantly false, so if you believe that, you're a moron, and i'm not going to have 
my chat overrun with talk about that nonsense 
[15:12] <glorytobeh> dsp christmass resmix when 
[15:12] <mundzbang> if hes triggered im happy 

[15:12] <kozatof> @hobbsl017 come here big boy and taste my wild beast hahahaha 

[15:12] <tendermanen> Escort theory is so dumb, why would Phil have to hire an escort so that he can tell 

everyone he has a girlfriend?Why wouldn’t he just say 'I have a girlfriend' for free? 

[15:12] <darksydephil> so here is your warning, don't talk about it and derail the chat or else you'll get the boot. 
[15:12] <musclesforbones> I just got here, someone ruined already? :( 

[15:12] <hobbsl017> @iradiumviking again an international escort doesnt mean that she sells sex. thats why its 
an escort and not a hooker.... escorts are passed off of just providing company 

[15:12] <stunted> Phil you've been doing this for how many years and you've still not managed to master not 
being baited by trolls?

[15:35] <kozatof> Saget DansGame 

[15:35] <reggieface420> huh? DansGame 

[15:35] <davel9067> thats Saget ownage 

[15:35] <bethelewd> kekon you YOU 

[15:35] <i_came_here_to_something> TBF SFV is probably the most technical SF at tourney level too. Plinking, 
one-frame links galore, tons of option selects etc. 

[15:35] <universepope> Phil used to main Saget in SF4 to get easy wins, didn’t he? 

[15:35] <bethelewd> 08ER 

[15:35] <i_came_here_to_something> Sorry meant SFIV 
[15:35] <majinboo3> nah he used to main zangief 
[15:35] <majinboo3> a character almost as broken as saget was 
[15:35] <universepope> Ahh, right, right. 

[15:36] <qu4ck_> I know SFV isn’t great but it has improved a lot since you played phil, and arcade edition 
looks solid. 

[15:36] <astrojetboy> ComPETITive game 

[15:36] <kozatof> What happened to the Slavic guy that was here 

[15:36] <kozatof> Did he get banned 

[15:36] <sidella434> i like easy mode 

[15:37] <i_came_here_to_something> @qu4ck_ It's no use dude, tho all his protesting makes it seem like he 
might cave and try AE sometime especially if he knew that he can get it for free since he has vanilla SFV 
[15:37] <bethelewd> its not popular to me 
[15:37] <universepope> dspSurpriseddsp 
[15:37] <qu4ck_> We’ll see I guess. 

[15:37] <theycallmejimbob> BeTheLewd please 
[15:37] <solidussnakex> Not everyone is a real gamer 
[15:37] <majinboo3> there are no hard games just bad players 
[15:38] <i_came_here_to_something> Agreed w/ that opinion 100% 

[15:38] <hobbsl017> danRude danRude danRude danRude

[15:38] <bethelewd> i just dont wanna play em 
[15:38] <amypinkgirl21> Want it come out 
[15:38] <bethelewd> so FUCK EM 

[15:38] <noxyl984> cheer 10 How is adding an easy mode so that more people can enjoy the game ruining 
everything? You don’t have to play the easy mode 

[15:39] <majinboo3> no child left behind single handly shattered the US Education system 
[15:39] <majinboo3> sad 

[15:39] <pr34ch> BeTheLewd yeah you hate em because they beat you :-)

[15:40] <i_came_here_to_something> @noxyl984 B/c the people asking for it aren't asking the right people. 

Tell it to console manufacturers, not the game developers. Why should game devs ruin their vision and game 
design challenge b/c some people don’t have the skill to beat them. 

[15:40] <universepope> Phil's uncle got trolled too hard

and silent the whole time, was very awkward 

[15:41] <sherrie92> resident evil 5 was the last good one imo

[15:41] <eldeadmariachi> A 

[15:42] <zombiebeer> i used to play gameboy when the family got together lol 
[15:42] <solidussnakex> Resident evil 2 and 3 are the best 

[15:42] <majinboo3> one of my favorite horror game were the clockwork series if anyone remember those games 
[15:42] <pr34ch> BeTheLewd why the sad face you should be happy you can spent te time with them as long as 
you still can 

[15:42] <bethelewd> resi 2 is the best 
[15:42] <maxpainxl0000> A 
[15:42] <majinboo3> or the clocktower 
[15:42] <bethelewd> second best is resi 4

[15:46] <waifudestroyermatt> lets all remember this when phil starts playinh monster hunter 
[15:47] <kushiyakitori> people would obviously pick the difficulty that they enjoy more wouldnt they? 

[15:47] <bethelewd> jim i wish i was in a bet with you on that stream 

[15:47] <forsakenfalcon> spend your souls and dont horde them and there is no penitential lost from

[15:47] <theycallmejimbob> ah-ha dspHmm 

[15:47] <i_came_here_to_something> Exactly. Not every film is made for every person. Same thing w/ games. 
Get used to it, find an easier game if one is too hard for you. 

[15:47] <kushiyakitori> thats what the normal mode of the hard game would be? that doesn't answer his cheer 
[15:47] <fluttershyl970> phill what is your stance on people use cheats or mods to win the games ? 

[15:47] <bos2161> I like the optional ball busting in the soul games. The optional bosses that are strong af lol 
[15:47] <bammbino> 23 4 

[15:47] <eldeadmariachi> I only play games on Hard/Very hard fot the challenge and the reward of beating the 
challenge, games these days feel easy to me. 

[15:47] <hobbsl017> thats why there is still games like guilty gear skull girls dead or alive that arent dumbed 
down

[15:51] <noxyl984> cheerlO You didn’t answer my question at all, you just reiterated that make every game easy 
is bad so I'll try again. How does having an easier difficulty setting in a game, like Mass Effect Andromeda and 
Assassin’s Creed Origins’ Narrative modes ruining it for everyone? Hell, even a hardcore shooter like DOOM has 
an easy mode. 

[15:51] <bethelewd> cow chop is 2 youtubers and a bunch of editors and camermenAvomen BUT all of them get

[16:04] <markmccauley> Philip/Phillip Burnell, you need a job. 

[16:04] <leewanner> I'm getting a tax cut this year and I'm stoked. I own my own business, but it's small and I 
don’t own a home or anything epic like that. I also think that the rich getting richer is awesome -1 want everyone 
to be richer, because I know that the success of others is not at my expense. 

[16:04] <demovdarkwave> "Oh woes is me"

[16:06] <bionich00t> To clarify who Phil's talkig about: Boogire2988 used his Patreon funds to go on a vacation 
to visit fellow cuckholds in Europe a few years ago. He had to pay thousands to fly him over in a special plane 
made for Elephants, Whales and other heavy animals. He was confirmed to spend 1000s a day on fast food and 
being cucked. 

[16:06] <thatanonyraccoon> @StratManl909 someone who lets their wife get fucked by another man

[16:07] <stratmanl909> @ThatAnonyRaccoon well that's not very nice :( 

[16:07] <ultrasonic_0> Boogies wife was probably fed up not being banged. There's no way he was taking care 
of her " needs " 

[16:08] <bammbino> narrative modes are okay in my book! i just dont play them 

[16:08] <kinggoken> i like the little cesars lunch combo. Five bucks for four big slices of pizza and a drink 
[16:08] <kinggoken> hits da spot 

[16:08] <bionich00t> To clarify on the Patreon scandal: Boogie2988 used Patreon funds to fund his vacation to 
Europe. He had to pay around 10900 to be flown over in a special plane that can hold Elephants, Whales and 
other large mammals. He did this to meet other cuckholds in Europe despite being a millionaire. 

[16:08] <opposable> Boogie would shit his diapers and get his wife to change it 

[16:08] <kinggoken> but da little ceasars don’t deliver, only drawback 

[16:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @Bionich00t If that's true then fuck Boogie and LUL 

[16:08] <elrariachi> Thank you for the answer. It was worth it. thank you

[16:08] <eddievaderl986> bailiff 3:16 says i just took your house

[16:08] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[16:08] <staticmesh_wav> @Pr34ch No, I think that shit's doable because I was in a similar situation to boogie 
few years back 

[16:09] <theycallmejimbob> lean meats and leafy greens VoHiYo 
[16:09] <unzippedcookie> xD 

[16:09] <kinggoken> Boogie needs to hit da gym. If not for himself, do it for his fans 



[16:09] <bammbino> @ThatAnonyRaccoon the only issue i have with pizza now is that 1 pie costs as much as it 
used to for 2-3 pies 

[16:09] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> RaccAttack is a broccoli smoothie guy 
[16:09] <thatanonyraccoon> @Bammbino y'know what's NOT fine in moderation? DEATH

[16:09] <darksydephil> ElRariachi : i'm assuming it was something really stupid, like you wanted to get a sound 

byte from me for something, because it made zero sense 

[16:09] <opposable> Do you think boogie and his wife even fucked 

[16:09] <sherrie92> has phill spoke about psx?

[16:10] <adr525> happy holidays? what is this PC nonsense Kappa 

[16:10] <bionich00t> When you’re that fat sex is logistically impossible 

[16:10] <zombiebeer> waa boogies wife with him before he made money? 

[16:10] <pr34ch> staticmesh_wav so was i but still to say its easy to make that choice is harsh

[16:10] <thatanonyraccoon> he probably gets headcheese that smells like mayo dspEw 
[16:10] <sherrie92> how fat is boogie 

[16:10] <staticmesh_wav> If he limited his diet to 1000 calories he would've lost the weight within a year 
[16:10] <i_came_here_to_something> grown ass man and can’t even get your dick out. Damn, Boogie LUL 
[16:10] <bionich00t> Boogie weighs 7001bs at his heaviest 
[16:11] <bionich00t> Now he weighs only 5001bs 
[16:11] <zombiebeer> jesus

[16:11] <sherrie92> neither do i 

[16:11] <thatanonyraccoon> sounds like a scooby doo villain 
[16:11] <bionich00t> Boogie has mental problems and he has autism 
[16:11] <zombiebeer> food is a helluva drug 

[16:11] <hobbsl017> boogies surgery did go rly well tho he lost a lot of weight 
[16:11] <kinggoken> Boogie is a super fat guy 

[16:11] <i_came_here_to_something> B/c Boogie's kind of an ass, that's why 
[16:11] <bionich00t> You can tell if you watch Boogie's videos he's really autistic
