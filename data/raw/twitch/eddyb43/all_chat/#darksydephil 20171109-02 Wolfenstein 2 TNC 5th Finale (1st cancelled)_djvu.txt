[19:48] <scruffshark> Mic is shit, but that's what happens witha usb microphone. 

[19:48] <majinboo3> no mods 

[19:48] <solidussnakex> Just buy some astros yes 

[19:48] <ratchefanl2> kozatof 

[19:48] <synapse_321> get the $250 pair 

[19:48] <thatanonybear> @kozatof did i miss something?? 

[19:48] <mose2118> @kozatof got it 
[19:48] <pactfox> no H E A T 

[19:48] <bernielomax517> $250 for a pair of headphones gtfo 
[19:48] <kozatof> Oh nah I thought there were no mods here 
[19:48] <dogkicker> he also wants 3 pairs 

[19:48] <karlaborn> i've never used headphones to game, is it really a necessity? 

[19:48] <fieldspire> this is pretty good LUL 

[19:48] <little_blake> But they don't operate at the same band so its fine 
[19:48] <oldchipz> no 

[19:48] <scruffshark> @SpookyWuN So he's bringing this up to tell us that our reccomendations aren’t going to 
be helpful. 



[19:49] <synapse_321> yea. why not. he needs durable and reliable. 

[19:49] <punishedjuliana> the real tech is just buying an endgame headkrone and never thinking about it ever 
again 

[19:49] <staticshock851> 100% immersive 
[19:49] <synapse_321> might as well go all out 

[19:49] <scruffshark> Again, he doesn’t need something this expensive. 

[19:49] <gabriel_ko> I wear glasses and headphones just make my ears hurt 

[19:49] <neospartanhesperos9> @Fieldspire it's fucking hilarious LUL 

[19:49] <d4gamerz> Im wearing a 30$ headset right now and the sound and quality is crisp 

[19:49] <kozatof> @punished Juliana just buy Doritos headphones 

[19:49] <speedweed_> lrnao 

[19:49] <d4gamerz> Astro's are unnecessary luxury headphones 

[19:49] <nightbot> WaifuDestroyerMatt just tipped $2.00 

[19:49] <kinggoken> this is the best stream on TWITCH. Hands down. 

[19:49] <solidussnakex> They come with a mix amp 

[19:49] <oldchipz> you really don’t need 200+ headphones, you are not a CSgo pro player 

[19:50] <punishedjuliana> as much as i hate gaming krones, sennheiser game zeros blow those out of the water 

Kappa 

[19:50] <hindae> Astro A40TR are like $250 - $300 wow, no way id pay that 

[19:50] <temoblanks> Next Phil is going to say he NEEDS a RacerX chair because of his back or something. 
[19:50] <staticshock851> lots of time covering this topic huh

[19:50] <kittyspank> so bad dont buy that junk 

[19:50] <scruffshark> I can plug this headset to my PS4 too, so I don't see why you gonna buy a 200+ price. 
[19:50] <cookiemonster414> why the hell does phil think the more expensive the headphone the more durable it 
is cause thats not always the case. 

[19:50] <kinggoken> A 

[19:50] <kittyspank> price does not = quality/durability 

[19:50] <kozatof> @cookiemonster414 therea€™s a reason why money is a problem with him 
[19:50] <temoblanks> *DXRacer (sorry) 

[19:50] <pray4rock> Correct @cookiemonster414 

[19:50] <spookywun> no need for the mic to work anyways LuL

[20:29] <lickmybussy> Reminds me of killing a chicken in Skyrim and the entire town comes after you. 

[20:29] <cz751over> It’s as silly as stealth in a Doom game 

[20:29] <scruffshark> It seems like current gen games have all just been shitty. 

[20:29] <carriewassweet> Phil always complains...that's his "thing"

[20:53] <manyperegrine81> Maybe get a new weapon 

[20:53] <cz751over> @flipl700 sucks this game doesn’t even have a final boss fight like New Order did 
[20:53] <hiddarg> it gimps you 

[20:53] <popsicolo> No @NeoSpartanHesperos9 my favorite ship is Joey Wheeler x Seto Kaiba

[20:54] <cte900> new order final boss was bullshit anyways, at least on death incarnate it was tedious as fuck 
[20:54] <thatanonybear> dspFun 

[20:55] <popsicolo> I remember when I did my first playthrough of New Order on Uber on a whim NotLikeThis 

[20:55] <neospartanhesperos9> sourpls

[20:56] <manyperegrine81> Yep no camping for you 

[20:57] <kittyspank> reminds me of that zombie match MiniK 



[20:57] <popsicolo> It wasn't for most of the game Kate, but there was a mandatory fight during part of the 
U-boat level that you can't stealth through. 

[20:58] <dukaduka> splash damage LUL 
[20:58] <manyperegrine81> You missed phil. 

[20:58] <dukexjt> the other corner might have more armor 

[20:58] <djrunol> ass could also mean donkey so it is perfectly fine Kappa 

[20:58] <eternia_forever> sigh 

[20:58] <dukaduka> missed? i was aliens man

[20:59] <mose2118> that was good tho 

[20:59] <fluttershyl970> i like alexa bliss's biscuit ass 

[20:59] <staticshock851> left side there is such a bad angle to be attacked from 
[20:59] <dukexjt> Peanut butter and honey cinnamon toast is the bomb 
[20:59] <hiddarg> what the fuck was that WutFace 
[20:59] <bernielomax517> biscuit ass? 

[21:00] <dukaduka> @katexo234 i looked that up. looks gross. :D 

[21:00] <popsicolo> "I live on peanut butter sandwiches, I don't care" -G.G. Allin 

[21:00] <manyperegrine81> Is Alexa bliss a porn star? 

[21:00] <pelhamplays> mayyyybbbbeeee your camping position ain't great 

[21:00] <eternia_forever> is he getting anywhere or a long way to go @nukacolaking ?

[21:00] <bernielomax517> The game is not stupid Lol 

[21:00] <nukacolaking> @Eternia_Forever same place I stopped playing :D

[21:01] <katexo234> well dukaduka it's good sandwich when your tired and have nothing to eat LUL LUL LUL 

[21:01] <eternia_forever> :D 

[21:01] <nukacolaking> I gave up after 2 hours 

[21:01] <dukaduka> @katexo234 you do what you gotta do 

[21:01] <pelhamplays> It's almost like the final fight is supposed to be challenging Kappa 
[21:01] <bernielomax517> Kappa 

[21:01] <hiddarg> i’m 100% sure this fight is immensely harder on console than on pc 
[21:02] <staticshock851> could be an anti camp thing so u ya know don't camp 
[21:02] <pray4rock> Who would have thought the final sections would be challenging 

[21:02] <eternia_forever> 2 hours damin @nukacolaking and then you quit wow Phil might be in some trouble 
here then 

[21:02] <lvlpower> clones 

[21:02] <manyperegrine81> I think you gotta kill the big dudes over their minions 

[21:02] <bernielomax517> This guy Lol 

[21:02] <kittyspank> kill the clone generator 

[21:02] <hiddarg> is the stream glitching with artifacts just for me? 

[21:02] <manyperegrine81> Another One!! 



[21:02] <hiddarg> this is the 5th time that happens 

[21:02] <nukacolaking> To me, the fight isn’t hard, nor the enemies.... It's just you get flanked at every spot. 

[21:02] <dukaduka> @Eternia_Forever no he’ll finish, but he's gonna have to play it conservatively at some point 
[21:02] <cte900> i think they're just coming to your area not just randomly spawning 
[21:02] <neospartanhesperos9> Use Dark-type moves to beat these psychics SwiftRage / 

[21:02] <gutty333> phil you were doing good on that corner spot before 

[21:03] <lickmybussy> @hiddarg Just you 

[21:03] <bernielomax517> Yes, the game devs are idiots LUL 

[21:03] <kushiyakitori> they probably just wanted to make it challenging for people... 

[21:03] <eternia_forever> Big trouble in little China cheer25 

[21:03] <speedweed_> fucking incredible 

[21:03] <dukaduka> @KushiYakitori hush OpieOP 
[21:03] <rpgasm38> moar Kreygasm 

[21:03] <rosasm014> trick is to dual wield rifles and smgs for higher dps 
[21:03] <manyperegrine81> a€oeFuna€D □ 

[21:03] <gutty333> what did you change the strategy, you were doing good in the corner 
[21:03] <eternia_forever> dspFun dspPepe dspHmm 
[21:03] <eternia_forever> its brewing 

[21:03] <djrunol> i think the uber weapon is bait, how much you wanna bet he is gonna perform better without it 
[21:03] <pelhamplays> Fight is challenging = "Devs are awful" 

[21:04] <staticshock851> i predict a rage quit soon 

[21:04] <gutty333> @staticshock851 he might just lower the difficulty 

[21:04] <furrywulfz> lower difficulty FUF 

[21:04] <pray4rock> COD world at war was way harder with the grenade spam 
[21:04] <staticshock851> FUF 

[21:04] <bernielomax517> He should lower it instead of bitching 

[21:04] <punished_juliana> My friends, are you aware of that terrible feel, that horrible feel when there truly is 
nothing you could do. 

[21:04] <dukaduka> yes they are going to shoot you FUF 
[21:05] <mujtabal2321> so many detractors 

[21:05] <manyperegrine81> After Rage quitting Shadows of War and Manhunt, it would be interesting as hell if 
Wolfenstein is Next haha 

[21:05] <hiddarg> every single time phil fires that gun i'm seeing random numbers glitching in with artifacts on 

the twitch's feed, what teh fuck is going on 

[21:05] <dukexjt> Sneak 

[21:05] <brockhmpton> " Shoot me" 

[21:05] <speedweed_> ded 

[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[21:05] <nukacolaking> does anyone else see screen glitching on the video or is it me? 

[21:05] <nukacolaking> like green rectangles 

[21:05] <hiddarg> @nukacolaking yassss i’m not the only one 

[21:05] <pelhamplays> You stood there and did nothing and let them shoot you 

[21:05] <dukaduka> HACK 

[21:05] <djrunol> wonder how phil would perform on "mein leben" difficulty, would he be able to beat the 
tutorial? 

[21:05] <mcmad32> has it snowed there yet? its 32 here in ohio

[21:05] <punished_juliana> its the current year 

[21:06] <lickmybussy> I think you should take cover when you are low on health 
[21:06] <eternia_forever> contra 16 

[21:06] <hiddarg> "it's just you" yeah how about that, thank god i thought my gpu was dying
