[10:51] <zahvone> Trolls are everyone on the internet, and everyone has some lol. His are just particularly nasty. 
Glad you could join us. 

[10:51] <zahvone> Did you by chance happen to see the holiday stream from last night? Quite good really. 
[10:52] <aquilak> Not really 

[10:53] <zahvone> It was great, drunk streams are fun lol 

[10:53] <aquilak> Cant wait to see 

[10:54] <zahvone> :D 

[10:58] <banlsh> when is he streaming 

[10:59] <zahvone> In about 30 minutes 

[11:13] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> [schedule 

[11:13] <nightbot> Friday Dec. 22: It's my first EVER Holiday Christmas Spectacular gaming marathon! Starts 
at 12pm PST, I'll be dressed up, drinking and playing fun Holiday-themed games all day long! 

[11:14] <kekon3> thats wrong 
[11:14] <zahvone> Indeed 
[11:17] <kekon3> it's monster hunter dayyy 
[11:17] <aquilak> ooh! 

[11:17] <goldencolts> holidaycheerlOO #charity 
[11:18] <konseggx> how many hours left ? 

[11:20] <zahvone> Less than that. 

[11:20] <aquilak> about 10? 

[11:20] <aquilak> Mins 
[11:22] <zahvone> mhm 

[11:22] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> DizzyDreidel 

[11:23] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> is Santa's Butt still unopened? LUL 

[11:23] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:24] <darksydephil> and yeah, out of all the liquor i bought for yesterday, santa's butt was the one i didn’t 
drink LOL 

[11:24] <darksydephil> by the way, anyone know if monster hunter is 30 or 60fps on ps4? im giong to guess 30 



[11:25] <aquilak> honestly don't know 
[11:25] <aquilak> and hey 

[11:26] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> I imagine it's 30fps 
[11:26] <aquilak> eeeew 

[11:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> apparently it's 40fps on PS4 Pro performance mode judging by what I'm 
reading 

[11:28] <zahvone> uh 

[11:28] <zahvone> Monster hunter is variable 

[11:28] <zahvone> In some cases it can be 60 fps, but for the most part I'm seeing it around 30, or 48 fps 
[11:29] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> but it's 30 on base PS4 right? 

[11:30] <zahvone> I have the base PS4. It goes from 30 to 60 60 sometimes, but that could have just been a flaw 
from the old beta. 

[11:30] <zahvone> I would stick it to 30 or 48 at most. 

[11:30] <critical_for_d4ys> cheerlO #charity

[11:40] <zahvone> lol 

[11:40] <bethelewd> zah dont be laughing im betting on you doing the same thing 
[11:40] <elipsion> Insect Glaive best weapon 

[11:41] <kekon3> Btw, when you party up in the MH beta, they didn’t have enough time to implement Friend 
invites so "lobby ID" is how you get into lobbies in the beta 
[11:41] <zahvone> Rofl 

[11:41] <kekon3> Friend codes will be in main game tho 
[11:41] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Jebaited 
[11:41] <kekon3> I mean friend invites 

[11:41] <zahvone> The id system is so annoying currently. I was very confused by that 
[11:42] <riley_212> Theirs so much snow outside Ia€™m go and build a snowman lol 

[11:42] <critical_for_d4ys> cheer60 #charity dont know why people saying that you have a bad taste in gaming 
cuz you like ride to hell, i guess people forgot there is a think called opinions 

[11:42] <kekon3> yeah, long story short, it was more complicated than you think to implement invites for the 
demo 

[11:42] <critical_for_d4ys> now im top cheer 



[11:42] <critical_for_d4ys> :) 

[11:42] <zahvone> That's what I'm thinking now, lol

[11:44] <darksydephil> so ill need to make a code and i guess PM it to you guys here? 

[11:44] <zahvone> You can send it on PSN as well if you'd like. Whichever is eassier 
[11:45] <zahvone> Easier*. All you do is start up a lobby and it makes the code.

[12:05] <popsicolo> KFC for Christmas has been big since like the 1970s. 

[12:05] <zahvone> I think Dr. Disrespect described the game perfectly. It's so interesting to people because each 
game has a storyline. That sounds stupid, but it makes sense yeah?

camera) instead of the tracking one. large monsters only, and change the radial menu to klick when choosing or 

just disabled it entirely, tip to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Really hope you enjoy your time 

with Monster Hunter, ps. long time viewer since Battlefield 1943 on 360 cheer 10

[13:04] <aquilak> birds? 

[13:05] <majinboo3> damn phil is the best monster hunter player 

[13:05] <majinboo3> hes owning 

[13:05] <doctorzzz> seems repetetive as fuck this game 

[13:05] <aquilak> honestly yes 

[13:05] <theycallmejimbob> Zahvone with the sass :o 

[13:05] <aquilak> Micro transactions coming soon! 

[13:05] <the_elusiveone45> MH is always repetitive. THat's the nature of the game. 

[13:05] <waifudestroyermatt> @DoctorZzZ no, there are a huge amount of varied monsters that all have 
different strategies 

[13:05] <majinboo3> MH is a grindfest game like disgaea i guess 

[13:05] <bethelewd> jim this bet probably wont even apply untilhe fights harder enemies than this rock monster 
and that first enemy 

[13:05] <dankmemeking840> Phil needs to use whetstone soon 
[13:06] <majinboo3> just grind 500 hours until you become op as shit 
[13:06] <super_slade> A Rock Lobster reference? Interesting 

[13:06] <the_elusiveone45> You take quests to hunt monsters to gain new things, unlock better equipment, buy 
items, buy new weapons, etc. 

[13:06] <doctorzzz> fight run fight, so far no real tactics maybe fullgame has some more 

[13:06] <theycallmejimbob> wait so if Phil gets revived does that count as a death BeTheLewd dspHmm 

[13:06] <the_elusiveone45> The Co-op is the appeal of the game. 

[13:06] <super_slade> the big question is: where are the loot boxes?? 

[13:06] <the_elusiveone45> MH World will have a full story Mode as well. 

[13:06] <bos2161> PogChamp 
[13:06] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Woooo 
[13:06] <fatestayjedi> yeehaaaw

[13:07] <majinboo3> WTYF 

[13:07] <the_elusiveone45> monster Hunter has a learning curve, and definitely isn’t for everyone. 

[13:07] <jack_spartacus> cheerl5 #charity

[13:26] <sardarkh> KILL THE AIR 
[13:26] <skooma_dealer> wew laddie 

[13:26] <katastrophe> Urn sorry, I am a huge fan of capcom games, but never tried monster hunter., whats the 
goal of the game? You just kill random monsters for XP? 

[13:26] <skooma_dealer> *just screaming and swinging wildly* 

[13:26] <sherrie92> @majinboo3 i dislike you now 
[13:26] <dashiku> you dont get xp 

[13:26] <dashiku> you kill monsters for parts, which you use to upgrade your gear 
[13:26] <thebrokenlegs218> Residentsleeper Residentsleeper 

[13:26] <majinboo3> The best english accent is probably a texas accent as its the only one that sounds remotely 
manly 

[13:26] <dashiku> which lets you hunt stronger monsters 
[13:27] <kinggoken> what do you guys think of this game 

[13:27] <dankmemeking840> @katastrophe kill monsters to craft weapons to kill stronger monsters and repeat 

[13:27] <majinboo3> All other accents are too high pitched for me 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> i think this game looks terrible 

[13:27] <katastrophe> That sounds... a bit lame haha 

[13:27] <sherrie92> @majinboo3 no 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> dem pixels 

[13:27] <danielbargen> Ahhhhh ita€™s so fun 

[13:27] <kinggoken> lol @Skooma_Dealer 

[13:27] <bethelewd> im pretty sure there is a story but as this is a beta you get multiplayer 

[13:27] <sardarkh> Thriving gameplay 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> these textures are SHIT 

[13:27] <mikehuntthedestroyer> majinboo, are you serious WutFace 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> dspAngrydsp 

[13:27] <super_slade> @Katastrophe It's about four Japanese schoolgirls who learn that the most powerful thing 
in the world ... is friendship 

[13:27] <katastrophe> Can you encounter some super rare monsters at least? 

[13:27] <dashiku> it sounds lame yeah but when you start playing it youll see that its fun 
[13:27] <katastrophe> Any incentive beyond "grow more powerful from crafting" 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> its a game for people with sever autism T B H 

[13:27] <bethelewd> but ya know either way the goal is to hunt monsters hence monster hunter 

[13:27] <majinboo3> im actaully being serious like other voices literally make my ears hurt they are sensitive 

[13:27] <dashiku> missions do have random monsters yes 

[13:28] <theycallmejimbob> I've had enough of your destiny bashing Zahvone dspAngrydsp 
[13:28] <wxrxaxtxh> "mount his ass" 

[13:28] <majinboo3> Its the reason why i literally cant listen to high pitched music 
[13:28] <bethelewd> zahvone has a point though this is FUN 

[13:28] <katastrophe> Fike a monster with a snakes's head , a fish's body and a cat's ass 



[13:28] <thebrokenlegs218> play pubg 

[13:28] <dashiku> you usyally have one main monster to hunt and up to 2 random monsters on the map 

[13:28] <bethelewd> destiny is SHIT 

[13:28] <katastrophe> THEN I’d have an incentive to play 

[13:28] <skooma_dealer> nah 

[13:28] <skooma_dealer> they arent greek monsters 

[13:28] <mikehuntthedestroyer> FeelsGingerMan 

[13:28] <dankmemeking840> desti- Residentsleeper 

[13:28] <dashiku> there are some pretty weird monsters in this though 

[13:28] <aquilak> this looks slightly boring 

[13:28] <skooma_dealer> are they both gay or just kekon 

[13:28] <dashiku> like a hippo gorilla 

[13:28] <super_slade> half man, half pig, half bear 

[13:28] <skooma_dealer> im getting gay vibes from zav 

[13:28] <danielbargen> And thata€™s cool 

[13:28] <doctorzzz> its keykon 

[13:28] <majinboo3> it also doesnt help half of the british accents are completly sloshed and impossible to tell 

what they are saying 

[13:29] <wxrxaxtxh> its gaykon 

[13:29] <bethelewd> kata they do have super hard boss like enemies but nothing like that :D 
[13:29] <malladath> the bow is bad ass now 
[13:29] <sardarkh> Hit Sponge enemies 
[13:29] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[13:29] <majinboo3> because they think they are germans and slur their words so much 
[13:29] <katastrophe> Hehe :D 

[13:29] <oyoho> is there a boss health bar i don't see or how does it work ? 

[13:29] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Oh shit im feelin it. Kekon! 

[13:29] <thedapperchangeling> This looks boring because Phil's letting the others do all of the work. 

[13:29] <danielbargen> He survive 

[13:29] <malladath> no there isnt a health bar 

[13:29] <skooma_dealer> ROFL they just take off without him 

[13:29] <skooma_dealer> HAHAHAHA 

[13:29] <thelastrambo341> @majinboo3 what are you saying? 

[13:29] <kinggoken> how do you tell when a monster is almost dead?? 

[13:29] <dashiku> hes not really letting them, hes actually trying to play for once 
[13:29] <skooma_dealer> shunned again 
[13:29] <mikehuntthedestroyer> LUL 

[13:29] <katastrophe> Since this is Capcom it wouldn't surprise me if some of the monsters look a lot like the 

hunters from Resident Evil :D 

[13:29] <dashiku> hes just not good enough 

[13:29] <kinggoken> do they move slowly? 

[13:29] <praenotuom> oyoho nope, you look at monster behavior, limping, drooling etc. 

[13:29] <malladath> it will start limping 

[13:29] <majinboo3> im saying the british have the worst english its embarrassing 

[13:29] <wxrxaxtxh> damn yall treating Kekon like capalpacino LOL 

[13:29] <majinboo3> a language they invented and they cant even speak it good 

[13:30] <sherrie92> @majinboo3 i dislike you 

[13:30] <rotoch4mp> what a hairy dinosaur 

[13:30] <kinggoken> lol @majinboo3 

[13:30] <skooma_dealer> guise listen 

[13:30] <danielbargen> The monster health bar are on the bottom left 
[13:30] <ashfordian2015> @majinboo3 which British accent? 



[13:30] <skooma_dealer> can you two soybois kiss eachother pis 

[13:30] <thelastrambo341> @majinboo3 Britain has four countries, you need to be specific 
[13:30] <doctorzzz> wow dhood 
[13:30] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 

[13:30] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Why did they get anime VAs on this? Oh wait it's Capcom of course 
[13:30] <bethelewd> kata they might look like em but they would count as smaller enemies cause hunters are 
way smaller than what phil is fighting 

[13:30] <aquilak> aaah I see now. health bar on the monster makes sense 
[13:30] <gar4o> that beast is pretty wild ;) 

[13:30] <majinboo3> Even the irish can speak better english then the british 

[13:30] <hypernuke6> hey phill i think u should walk into the monster. Im pretty sure it does more dmg that 
what your doing;)

[13:32] <fch40> fail 

[13:32] <gar4o> i see fair enough makes sense thank you;]] 

[13:32] <theycallmejimbob> 6 of the 9 counties in Ulster are British dspHinm 
[13:32] <ashfordian2015> @majinboo3 youa€™re a plastic paddy!

[13:32] <super_slade> is there free health care? 

[13:32] <danielbargen> He died to a terrible death

[13:39] <majinboo3> Irish 

[13:39] <sherrie92> @majinboo3 lamo 

[13:39] <sherrie92> lmao* 

[13:39] <danielbargen> @darksydephil going away from the dragon 
[13:39] <sardarkh> Phil always using big weapons. Compensating? 

[13:39] <majinboo3> yea laugh yea 

[13:39] <dkmariolink> dragon is at the highest point. The nest 
[13:39] <mudai> I love how they all went into the wrong direction 
[13:40] <malladath> it may not have spawned 
[13:40] <majinboo3> british women with their crooked teeth 
[13:40] <gar4o> up in the nest up the tree 

[13:40] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Majinboo, are you a functional retard I have to ask 

[13:40] <mudai> like one dude knew they should eat before trying to beat it but didn’t know where it is located ha 
[13:40] <wxrxaxtxh> LOL 

[13:40] <dashiku> pretty sure you can find a wyvern egg as well to lure it 
[13:40] <skooma_dealer> hes not listening doods 
[13:40] <skooma_dealer> LOL 

[13:40] <kinggoken> thats not nice @mikehuntthedestroyer 

[13:40] <danielbargen> Omg @darksydephil 

[13:40] <majinboo3> dont mind him 

[13:40] <danielbargen> Hea€™s leaving the nest 

[13:40] <danielbargen> Lol 

[13:40] <majinboo3> brits can only talk 

[13:40] <thegodemperortrump> You have to give him bits 

[13:40] <majinboo3> thats all they know 

[13:40] <skooma_dealer> this is BOR-RING 

[13:40] <aquilak> A 

[13:40] <thedapperchangeling> Here's the trick: Phil knows where he’s going, he's just running as far away from 
the fight as possible. 

[13:40] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[13:40] <mudai> the beta doesn't even show you what the full game will have to offer 
[13:41] <malladath> the beta is a lot easier than the actual game too 
[13:41] <sherrie92> @majinboo3 saids someone from ireland 

[13:41] <dashiku> also phil doesnt know what to do so obv it looks more boring then it actuall yis 

[13:41] <bobbi_ling> i been missing out on phil content, was watching LIS on youtube cause i loove when phil 

shits on it LUL 

[13:41] <danielbargen> The monster should be on the top right tent 

[13:41] <mudai> "I always liked monster hunter" then you should know that this beta is like showing only a 
fraction of the actual game 

[13:41] <thedapperchangeling> Also, his fansquad is all terrible as well, so you don't even get any decent plays. 
[13:41] <malladath> a very small fraction 
[13:41] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[13:41] <bethelewd> jim 2-2 good game but you shouldve won oh well maybe you will win if you got a match 
on boxing day 

[13:41] <pinkdam> if it's boring being played by an inexperienced player then that's not a very good advert for 
the game 

[13:41] <katastrophe> How does Phil determine who plays with him anyway? 

[13:41] <dkmariolink> @mudai or hes just a bandwagoner LuL 



[13:41] <katastrophe> Does he have like a set squad? 

[13:42] <bobbi_Hng> wow beth is here 

[13:42] <thedapperchangeling> Kat: Paytreon 

[13:42] <thegodemperortrump> Whoever gives him the most money 

[13:42] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe BeTheLewd 

[13:42] <mudai> @Dkmariolink yeah that's more likely LUL 

[13:42] <skooma_dealer> mon nay 

[13:42] <majinboo3> i mean how can you expect new players to buy a game if you need to sink 100s of hours to 
be good 

[13:42] <majinboo3> thats obviously absurd 

[13:42] <hypernuke6> hmm apprently fire is rathalos weakness, thats uses fire but whats logic in mh 

[13:42] <bobbi_ling> and jiminay 

[13:42] <skooma_dealer> and sluuuuurping 

[13:42] <super_slade> @Katastrophe A four-day battle royale to the death 

[13:42] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 

[13:42] <theycallmejimbob> hey Bobbi TekkenPanda 

[13:42] <konseggx> the game looks neat <3 

[13:42] <mudai> @majinboo3 so like every fighting game? 

[13:42] <thesnakel 11> People have different interests anyway, and overall the Beta was received fairly well. 
[13:42] <garbosis> naix is a f a g 

[13:42] <bethelewd> jim 2-2 is a better match than chelsea 0-0 
[13:42] <katastrophe> LUL 

[13:42] <mudai> or like many other multiplayer games? 

[13:42] <bethelewd> hey bobbi 

[13:42] <bobbi_fing> flex them pandas 

[13:42] <dkmariolink> the trail is at the top of the nest...

[13:42] <wxrxaxtxh> EAT IT. 

[13:42] <dashiku> @hypernuke6 rathalos is weak to lightning and ice, not fire 
[13:42] <skooma_dealer> dspEw 

[13:42] <majinboo3> too be honest the only people buying this are either monster hunter fans who know what 
they are getting into or people into grinding games 
[13:42] <bobbi_ling> i heard beth is from birmingham. 

[13:42] <dashiku> @dunno who told you that but they were wrong 

[13:42] <majinboo3> i dont see complete noobs bying this 

[13:42] <bethelewd> FBhome FBaway 

[13:43] <skooma_dealer> or giant weebos with tism 

[13:43] <ashfordian2015> Is Phil seeing his lady friend at Christmas 

[13:43] <thedapperchangeling> The reaction to MH tends to people people who play it, or who aren't ADHD 
idiots. 

[13:43] <skooma_dealer> im falling asleep 
[13:43] <skooma_dealer> honestly 
[13:43] <majinboo3> Skooma i've already fallen asleep

MHGen.

[14:19] <bethelewd> ok now i am counting fails and deaths to make it fair on me 

[14:19] <dashiku> @aquilak but it does make sense for this monster to have a lot of health. Its a higher level 

monster than the other ones on this map. its intended to be hunted at a higher level with stronger gear 

[14:19] <bethelewd> 3-0 

[14:19] <bobbi_ling> kekon likes tekken dspEw

games. It's the same shit for the most part 

[15:32] <eternia_forever> did you ever spike your water with anything @theycallmejimbob 
[15:32] <aquilak> is that the only sound track there playing? I'm starting to notice not changing at all or idk

[15:32] <inopss> Phil soloed g - rank in 4u 

[15:32] <bethelewd> not to mention it is harder anyway cause 3 player co op

[15:36] <eternia_forever> no sir @theycallmejimbob 

[15:36] <lokatee> You need four unless you are really optimal with your dps 

[15:36] <shega_ace> get a bow user or Bowgun user and use Paralyze Coatings/shots to ground him 

[15:36] <derpiel2> But they didna€™t bring it over to give it exclusively 

[15:36] <residentevilbeating> use the hammer 

[15:36] <gar4o> nope 

[15:36] <shega_ace> or use Paralyze Daggers on your item bar 

[15:36] <skooma_dealer> can we end this early so we can get to pubg sooner 

[15:36] <mysticstyles34> brain fart 

[15:36] <lucast2007us> i lioe the amount of beers in the usa

[15:37] <mrtricky69> oh god why is he using the great sword a noob weapon 

[15:37] <shega_ace> @DarksydePhil Bow or Bow Gun users have shots that can Paralyze and that will ground

[15:47] <bobbi_ling> yeah beth it is 

[15:47] <gnomusyl983> the way point moves because the monster is always on the move! 

[15:47] <link_im_not_zelda> the fact you no longer flex after using items makes this game a lot more easy to 

use items in tbh Kippa 

[15:47] <mrtricky69> how is the charge blade in this game 
[15:47] clink_im_not_zelda> it got buffed so

[15:48] <mrtricky69> you cant do this phil 

[15:48] <bethelewd> pubg devs are mad at fortnite devs cause its the same game but more cartoony 

[15:48] <aquilak> roasted....God dang 

[15:48] clink_im_not_zelda> he didnt do it NotLikeThis 

[15:48] <theycallmejimbob> :o damn Eternia Forever the recent haul boosted it a bit, don't you have a lot of PS3 
games too 

[15:48] <bethelewd> 11 jim 

[15:48] clink_im_not_zelda> NotLikeThis he didnt compare it 

[15:48] <gar4o> DansGame DarkMode 

[15:48] <gar4o> he did 

[15:48] clink_im_not_zelda> WELP 

[15:48] <gnomusyl983> Dark souls, yeah, and your under leveled... 

[15:48] <bethefueg> then gta should be mad at saints row @bethelewd

[15:48] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob yeah probly roughly bout the same 
[15:48] <lucast2007us> phil ur in charge end it 

[15:48] <aquilak> Whoa Phil my man They should've shown the difficulty on the menu to begin with? 



[15:49] <sherrie92> saints row 4 is awsome 

[15:49] <dee2cee> it heard you talking about trying to paralyze it LUL 
[15:49] <we_got_this> monster hunter predates the souls it started on ps2 
[15:49] <mrtricky69> i cant wait for the pc release 
[15:49] <pinkdam> you beat midir, you can beat this 

[15:49] <billyapplejuicetommy> phil hit him in the belly you do more damage 
[15:49] <bethelewd> bobbi you can play squad in pubg if you want to play with em 

[15:49] <link_im_not_zelda> Kappa monster hunter has always been like this phil dark souls is just budget 

monhun because it has basic enemies 

[15:49] <bethelewd> or you can be like fuck it and not play at all 
[15:49] <bobbi_ling> i knosw beth 

[15:49] <zeroknightblazer> shouldnt you start out small then? i mean, fighting the rathalos and diablos are there 
for a challenge 

[15:49] <bobbi_ling> its not my taste all the same 

[15:50] <gaminggumper> But in the main game youd have gear better able to deal with 
[15:50] <lucast2007us> pay wall incomming 

[15:50] <menardigames> rathalos is probably the hardest monster in the demo anyway 
[15:50] <aquilak> so move onto the next monster 
[15:50] <mrtricky69> fight the rathian 
[15:50] <bethelewd> 12 jim heh heh 

[15:50] <link_im_not_zelda> @Lucast2007us they did confirm it

good and bad times, love ya man keep it up cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl 

[15:50] <link_im_not_zelda> 9 carts? o no 

[15:50] <eazybayke> nothing they could do 

[15:50] <gnomusyl983> you have to learn the monsters attack patterns 

[15:50] <pinkdam> why do you expect it to ignore you in full view so you can fiddle with your equipment? how 
dumb can you be 

[15:50] <elipsion> @DarksydePhil This is suppose to be a challenge monster for the beta, the gear they give you 
in underleved for it 

[15:50] <lucast2007us> pay to progress phil 

[15:50] <dee2cee> maybe try another monster like the diablos? or has he done that already lol 
[15:50] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob i am very proud of the ps4 collection not because of how many i 
have but for how the low cost i paid for each and all bought new, showing that patience pays yes

[15:52] <lucast2007us> the king 

[15:52] <dee2cee> diablos hits hard, but at least he doesnt poison or flies around all the time if u r having trouble 
against him 

[15:52] <gar4o> you could guard too 

[15:52] <link_im_not_zelda> FeelsBannedMan 

[15:52] <superslygaming> lol 

[15:52] <darksydephil> i meant to click no someones name not ban lol 
[15:52] <darksydephil> my fault 
[15:52] <darksydephil> i hate twitch chat for the record 
[15:52] <convertedclone> lol 

[15:52] <shega_ace> You need a ranged Phil bow or bowgun user can use paralyze shots to bring him to the 
ground 

[15:52] <lutherkujo> dspNothing dspNothing 

[15:52] <flexmastodon> @DarksydePhil make sure you charge your greatsword attacks, you're doing way less 

damage than you could be 

[15:52] <we_got_this> twitch chat sucks 

[15:52] <dee2cee> FUF 

[15:52] <aquilak> lrnfao wow 

[15:52] <bobbi_ling> yes elf game plz 

[15:52] <aquilak> XD 

[15:52] <eldeadmariachi> Rip 

[15:53] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob yeah because for amount of games i want i could not do it for 60 

dollars each so waiting is very help full and such @theycallmejimbob 

[15:53] <hypernuke6> u know dsp u can CHARGE the great sword, but its ok 

[15:53] <lucast2007us> please make this the last one phil 

[15:53] <sherrie92> what is the cat for 

[15:53] <theycallmejimbob> there seems to be lots of flash sales in best buy and newegg etc too Eternia_Forever 
dspHmm 

[15:53] <flexmastodon> has he tried any other weapons btw? 

[15:53] <aquilak> no phil continue! 

[15:53] <moonbah> TriHard 7 Cx in the chat boys! 

[15:53] <zukyun> tahkey 
[15:53] <hypernuke6> yeah he has 

[15:53] <shega_ace> Charging the great sword to 3 charges is a waste of time and damage and likely hood of 

getting hit out of it. only do 2 charges 

[15:53] <mitchrvguy> F Vegetarians cheerlOO cheerlOO 

[15:54] <hypernuke6> no its not... 

[15:54] <dashiku> its not a waste of time what 

[15:54] <zeroknightblazer> oh lawd man, these guys be bashing about soo many stuff whe they havent even 
played the other series 

[15:54] <flexmastodon> uh no, always charge to level 3 if you can 
[15:54] <bethelewd> jim if stream ends earlier than usual i win new part of the deal :D 
[15:54] <lucast2007us> think i preferred this on the wii 
[15:54] <inopss> 3 charge is best 

[15:54] <sekander> imagine if you had to farm for that sword, and only did 5 damage per hit 



[15:54] <eternia_forever> 98% of the games i have are from bestbuy, which i get 20% off every game i buy new 
from day one even 

[15:54] <hypernuke6> how is it a waste of time?? 

[15:54] <kodykarls> cheer50 I wasn’t able to make it to your Holiday special due to work, but Merry Christmas, 
Phil, stay jolly! 

[15:54] <shega_ace> right but generally it's a hazard to get hit 

[15:54] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock BeTheLewd dspPepe you can’t be sneaky like deep 

[15:54] <noedel> if diablos doesnt spawn down that hole his spawn has been replaced by that chicken dinosaur, 

you need to re-host the mission for chance of him spawning again 

[15:54] <hypernuke6> not really lol 

[15:54] <bethelewd> jim deep taught me though 

[15:55] * bethelewd is sneaky 

[15:55] <menardigames> if Diablos isn’t in that area, she didn't spawn so you got the chicken instead 
[15:55] <flexmastodon> greatsword actually takes a lot of skill to play effectively. Phil would probably have 
more fun with a more beginner-friendly weapon 
[15:55] <pinkdam> phil did best with the mallet I think 

[15:55] <zeroknightblazer> what this group needs, is a good guide as a 4th player 

[15:55] <hypernuke6> like a sas 

[15:55] <shega_ace> i agree Flex 

[15:55] <lucast2007us> has Phil ever played diablo?? 

[15:55] <cookiemonster414> this seems like one of those game thats better to play than watch maybe? 

[15:55] <the_mafia_men_2> cheer50 You think you can FUCK WITH ME, Mr. Burnell? You don't know who 
you're FUCKING WITH!! We WANT our money by end of January or you will be stuck in a FINANCIAL 
HELLHOLE the likes of which would make Pope Francis pray to the Devil. WE WANT. OUR MONEY. 
JANUARY. #charity 

[15:55] <shega_ace> i didn’t like the great sword but then again it was never my play style 

[15:55] <aquilak> lol wow 

[15:55] <hypernuke6> well yeah 

[15:55] <aquilak> XD 

[15:55] <pinkdam> FTP 

[15:55] <zeroknightblazer> @FlexMastodon you true there 

[15:55] <gnomusyl983> You're learning the basics Phil. It pleases me. I remember you hating on dark souls in 

the beginning to... You'll love this to, eventually! I guarantee it! cheer50 

[15:56] <waifudestroyermatt> @Lucast2007us this is alot harder than diablo 

[15:56] <sekander> this also looks a bit like Dragon's Dogma 

[15:56] <lucast2007us> just not as enjoying for viewer 

[15:56] <hypernuke6> charhing 3 times is way more efficient then 2 charge 

[15:56] <inopss> A 

[15:56] <sherrie92> @Lucast2007us the last guardian was the same 
[15:57] <gar4o> them dragons are wild RageFace KappaClaus

[15:58] <waifudestroyermatt> @Lucast2007us its a lot more slower and tactical but if youve played MH you can 
appreciate a good player 
[15:58] <aquilak> lol 

[15:58] <waifudestroyermatt> which obviously phil is not 

[15:58] clink_im_not_zelda> tbh Rpgs are basically dark souls, they require knowledge of the mechanics and 

abilities of your moves to be successful at FeelsBadMan

available ? 

[16:00] <ccous666> mgsl? 

[16:00] <sekander> final game might be 90 hours of grinding 
[16:00] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm I'm not sure Eternia Forever tbh 
[16:00] <dante_must_die_> probably a waste if he's unable to sink time into it 
[16:00] <gnomusyl983> You won't play it at release? 

[16:01] <theycallmejimbob> cahman BeTheLewd with that rule addition you couldn’t lose dspPepe 
[16:01] <eternia_forever> @theycallmejimbob loved that one .. estella can’t a bella 

[16:01] <link_im_not_zelda> if you dont have any time just to play mh with it's not your thing yeah, it's 

something you get bored and do for a few hours 

[16:01] <lucast2007us> yeeeessass 

[16:01] <link_im_not_zelda> I can accept that 

[16:01] <waifudestroyermatt> @dante_must_die_ it takes time but it's a game that doesnt have microtransactions 
[16:01] <waifudestroyermatt> surely that's worth a play 



[16:01] <kodykarls> Do Alternate choices in Before the Storm Kappa 
[16:01] <bethelewd> ok fine jim you win since he didnt die 20 times 
[16:01] <lucast2007us> when is south park die???

[16:02] <waifudestroyermatt> fortnite over pubg monkaS 

[16:02] <sekander> they look good, but so much material farming and grinding 

[16:02] <desert_regal> oh phils played NITW? 

[16:02] <dashiku> material farming is way quicker in this game 
[16:02] <eternia_forever> lol 

[16:02] <theycallmejimbob> he has indeed DesertRegal for 2 hours 
[16:02] <dashiku> gathering specifically is quicker 
[16:02] <sekander> @DaShiku that's good 

[16:02] <mxttl0589> the actual game you can upgrade all your gear to make everything easier too 
[16:02] <gnomusyl983> I bought the Pro only for Monster Hunter! 

[16:02] <bethelewd> jim you made me humble pie yet? 

[16:02] <dashiku> if you harvest honey for example you get all the honey in one harvest 
[16:02] <sherrie92> fortnite never heard of it 

[16:02] <waifudestroyermatt> @DaShiku that’s good. I remember the mining on PSP to upgrade weapons was 
LONG 

[16:02] <dashiku> instead of 5-6 
[16:02] <kinggoken> no pubg? 

[16:02] <theycallmejimbob> we’ll call it a draw BeTheLewd since the stream didn’t last the 4 hours dspHmm 
[16:03] <waifudestroyermatt> is there still paintballs ? Or has that been removed 
[16:03] <dashiku> removed 

[16:03] <theycallmejimbob> he's playing it later Kinggoken so didn’t want to play it now 
[16:03] <dashiku> you use the scoutflies now 

[16:03] <waifudestroyermatt> too many times my paintball would expire as they start to fly off then it's hide and 
seek 

[16:03] <dashiku> and monsters are just on the map after you see them 
[16:03] * bethelewd splats pie in jimbob face

[16:43] <skooma_dealer> my throat hurtz 
[16:43] <tripledistance> what game is this? 

[16:43] <skooma_dealer> inb4.. 

[16:43] <thatanonyraccoon> Fortnite 

[16:43] <justdaid> then why is he still in that game category? @ThatAnonyRaccoon 

[16:43] <sherrie92> @tripledistance fortnite

[16:43] <superslygaming> use it as bait 

[16:44] <blue_blur64> Eventually the PVE mode will be f2p as well 
[16:44] <dylannw> It's not glitch, the game doesnt like you TPFufun TPFufun 
[16:44] <justdaid> that seems strange. 

[16:44] <blue_blur64> You can just pay to play that mode early if you want 
[16:44] <battlexmanx> any one here can tell me if the PvE is good 
[16:44] <blue_blur64> I haven't bought it so nope :P 

[16:45] <tripledistance> anyl know how big the f2p version is to download for the pc?
