[11:51] <astrojetboy> cheer 10 I forgot to ask yesterday but can’t you try to appeal to the good side of your tax 

attorney and try to get him help pay some of the money you owe as it is his fault. Its worth a shot and you never 

know what people are capable of. #charity 

[11:51] <a_lern> I started watching DSP in 2011 - Uncharted 3 

[11:51] <arcticsurface> Max Payne 3, oh the rage LUL 

[11:51] <amisbro> IIRC didn’t you call Max Payne 3 "Marky Mark with Slow Mo" to avoid copyright back then? 
[11:51] <kinggoken> lol 

[11:51] <dutchvanderlinde> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp la noire 
[11:51] <jg224> i remember that playthrough 

[11:52] <paleemptysphere93> I actually watched that original playthrough again like a month ago AA Such 
Nostalgia!! 

[11:52] <bethelewd> i remember watching the old 1 a noire plythrough 
[11:52] <kingofhypocrisy> Attorneys aren't known for their generosity lol 
[11:52] <vendatus> tax attorneys don’t have a nice side Kappa 

[11:52] <jg224> there was one hilarious point when he ran into a house saying he had to take a shit. I was 
cracking up. 

[11:52] <wjr02003> @darksydephil Just so you know the Truth, Lie and Doubt options have changed to Good 
Cop (truth), Bad Cop (doubt), and Accuse (lie). Getting used to it should be fun. 

[11:52] <bethelewd> yeah they had like 4-5 die chapters 

[11:52] <enzio814> He would have to sue 

[11:52] <derichloveslemur> I remember RedDeadDSP still:) 

[11:52] <sofiarayne> uh oh then xD 

[11:52] <kingofhypocrisy> From what I remember the only exclusive case was for the PS3, all the other were 



regular die 

[11:53] <alex_dragonul> Didn’t know , sucks what happened , so that means there will never be another game 
ever ? 

[11:53] <jannedaarcl35> cheer50 @Derichloveslemur says he's hyped for the return of Dicks with Guns! And 
Derich remembers the time that Cole Phelps ran up A house and face planted the roof and fell down.

[11:53] <kittyspank> ok

[11:57] <arcticsurface> Later in the game sure. 

[11:57] <panshatan> this was one of the best playthroughs with you solving the cases a □ 

[11:57] <bethelewd> yeah 5 DLC's in this game 2 for traffic, 2 for vice and 1 for arson when you eventually get 
to those points in the game 

[11:57] <a_lern> @me_god pretty sure it was Bully, in March 2013 

[11:58] <derichloveslemur> @DarksydePhil I believe L.A. Noire released in the middle of May 2011. 

[11:58] <sofiarayne> Phil, are you going to look at the chat at all whent he decisions come up or try to guess it 
all yourself? 

[11:58] <dutchvanderlinde> Great game to end the year 

[11:58] <arcticsurface> Phil's Bully had direct capture much later in the game. 

[11:58] <majinboo3> no way is this game 30 hours 

[11:58] <paleemptysphere93> Anybody else from Norway here? 

[11:58] <majinboo3> more like 15 lol

[12:51] <movielordl01> cheerlO Always be sure to look for clues. Music won’t end unless you've found them all! 

[12:51] <encephalolz> Public perception was extremely important for LAPD back then. They were almost 

celebrities. 

[12:51] <bethelewd> watch phil fail the first interrogation jim 
[12:51] <himself79> is this a horror game? 

[12:51] <sickogrind> Is the vr version cool? 

[12:51] <i_came_here_to_something> @Joxawil Or Phil could just count it towards Patreon himself, that way 

avoid the chargeback fees on both ends 

[12:51] <ginosaji8> LA Noire VR is fucking hilarious 

[12:51] <theycallmejimbob> WRONG BeTheLewd SwiftRage 

[12:51] <jdcherdy> @joxawil: why? it's IK either way. could put some of that money towards the MGS games 
anyway, combined those games probably don’t even cost $500. 

[12:51] <ggfunky> dspWowdude 
[12:51] <rotoch4mp> it is a platformer 

[12:51] <bethelewd> not a horror game unless you are the weakest mofo to horror

[12:52] <derichloveslemur> @DarksydePhil Intuitions are that you can ask the community or you can remove an 
answer.

[12:52] <sofiarayne> can’t believe you forgot that much Phil 

[12:52] <chickendinner_91> on the VR version 

[12:52] <donniedarksoulio> Phil will fail,we will taste the PJSalt soon 

[12:52] <i_came_here_to_something> I'm almost sure both games can be bought for under $60 togther 
@JDCherdy Kappa 

[12:52] <bethelewd> jim you will be wrong for the less than 10 failed interrogations 
[12:52] <jdcherdy> exactly, so in theory all 3 MGS games could be played now. 

[12:52] <iradiumviking> yea sure just pick it up like that 
[12:52] <ginosaji8> and the driving in the vr is excellent 
[12:52] <bethelewd> did they even have fingerprints shit in these days :D 
[12:52] <chickendinner_91> No 

[12:52] <sddaros> pretty sure they couldnt track fingerprints back then 

[12:52] <derichloveslemur> @darksydephil Do you remember what Intuition points are? 

[12:52] <iradiumviking> had they not invented fingerprints yet @BeTheLewd ?

[12:53] <chickendinner_91> Nor can they use DNA evidence 

[12:53] <i_came_here_to_something> It is odd MGS1 isn’t there @JDCherdy . That's the one that started it all 
[12:53] <ginosaji8> phil is learnin dspHmm 

[12:53] <bethelewd> jim considering he has not done 3-4 of the 5 dies for this game i dont think so 
[12:53] <kekon3> it is pretty dark, might want to adjust the contrast/brightness 
[12:53] <jdcherdy> yeah, especially since im guessing it can be downloaded. 

[12:53] <derichloveslemur> Phil, What are Intuition points? 

[12:53] <southaryan> cheer 10 to be fair, american gun culture is amazing

BECAUSE of the jokes and fails, and the Kojima stuff. 

[12:54] <alexander_rossi> cheer50 actually the biggest act of gun control legislation was passed in 1934 in 
response to prohibition 

[12:54] <bethelewd> gino we shall see if he keeps that learning knowledge 

[12:54] <movielordl01> cheerlO you have your partner drive for you by holding down triangle. Less damage on 
your results 

[12:54] <bionich00t> Actually Phil in the 1950s the USA had strict gun control policies but after the election of 
Nixon he relaxed all of them but states like CA never undid the gun control to this day due to liberal policies. 
[12:54] <bionich00t> FYI

[13:07] <bionich00t> But even 30% of them dying is 1000s 
[13:07] <glorytobeh> looks just like the pc version lrnao 

[13:07] <paleemptysphere93> Demon's Souls, Dark Souls & Bloodborne = Same shit. 

[13:07] <bethelewd> a choco donut is nice

[13:59] <rhinebtv> You basically find out who's lying during the mission 

[13:59] <bethelewd> ahhhh a harder time for phil comes at this house jim :P 

[13:59] <romethedrone> @loboconfiavel don't be a dickhead 

[13:59] <eddiebrock> He played this game 6 years ago. He doesn’t remember all of it. 

[13:59] <analyzedx69> AYY YO BISH TriHard 

[13:59] <rhinebtv> That’s one of the biggest flaws with this game, it has almost no replayability 
[13:59] <theoriginalweebgod> LaWeeMa His ASS 
[13:59] <bethelewd> not a easy triple truth and a lie guy 

[13:59] <theycallmejimbob> it'll be easy peasy for him BeTheLewd dspAngrydsp 
[14:00] <micgelo09> @DarksydePhil if you make him drive you cant be triggered for any traffic calls 
[14:00] <bethelewd> jim nope dspAngrydsp 
[14:00] <rotoch4mp> phil will dominate her 

[14:00] cbutter_my_bread> i get a Chinatown vibe 

[14:00] <bethelewd> hah 



[14:00] <factorbactorjr> asking why people replay games, is like asking why people rewatch movies and shows 

come on now LUL 

[14:00] <bethelewd> uh oh 

[14:00] <katexo234> TearGlove 

[14:00] <bethelewd> emotional women 

[14:00] <i_came_here_to_something> It's a story/narrative-based game, AAA Western at that. Of course ther’es 
no replay value Kappa 
[14:00] <superslygaming> ? 

[14:00] <loboconfiavel> dont trust those woman phil LOL 
[14:00] <rhinebtv> Yeah, but you can’t replay and act surprised 

[14:00] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> husband died, but don't worry the black dood claims there was no money 

[14:00] <theoriginalweebgod> shoot her too., her name is BLACK 

[14:00] <superslygaming> your husbands dead, now about ur water heater... 

[14:00] <adr525> instaheat did it;) 

[14:00] <rhinebtv> The game basically tells you who is lying immediately 

[14:01] <katexo234> I believe she killed him dspHinm 

[14:01] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[14:01] <glorytobeh> Phil should write some porn phils 

[14:01] <pelvic_sorcerer> she kinda looks like maggie gyllenhall 

[14:01] <jdcherdy> difference is people dont rewatch a movie and get paid while doing it lol 
[14:01] <iradiumviking> it have to be exaggerated lol 

[14:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Nah, Maggie's face is way longer these days. Go watch her in The Deuce, 
you'll see what I mean 

[14:01] <eddiebrock> Cole Phelps is a finisher. 

[14:01] <loboconfiavel> this motion capture really hold up 
[14:01] <kingofhypocrisy> She killed him with pollen 

[14:01] <bethelewd> jim i think phil sneaks in some egg nog before the second streams and that is what makes 
him extremely lewd :D 

[14:01] <theoriginalweebgod> y arn’t u shooting these ppl phil 
[14:01] <eddiebrock> He's so uptight he has to finish a plumbing job. 

[14:02] <factorbactorjr> this may be a shocker to people., but some people redo things because they find it 

enjoyable, and not just for the new feeling :o 

[14:02] <rotoch4mp> put the gas in the water 

[14:02] <kingofhypocrisy> what's with that black outline 

[14:02] <theoriginalweebgod> CLEARLY they r ALL Criminals 

[14:02] <theycallmejimbob> :o do you watch the 2nd streams BeTheLewd don't they start at 3:30am? 

[14:02] <rhinebtv> Yeah but he's like, acting like he doesn't know what's going on 
[14:02] <superslygaming> why is the cop doing this? 

[14:02] <factorbactorjr> because he doesny 
[14:02] <factorbactorjr> doesnt 

[14:02] <jdcherdy> kinda has nothing to do with the fact that people dont get paid to rewatch movies and shows 

lol. otherwise every old playthrough could be replayed lol 

[14:02] <rhinebtv> But he already played the game 

[14:02] <bethelewd> jim no i watch the vids 

[14:02] <factorbactorjr> 6 years ago 

[14:02] <rhinebtv> Right? 

[14:02] <rhinebtv> That’s not that long to forget the whole plot of the game, idk 
[14:03] <glorytobeh> music still playing

[14:03] <bausleyfred> VAHHHz 

[14:03] <rhinebtv> That just seems absurd to me, I dunno 
[14:03] <horror_duck_l> lol at phil commentary. I love it 

[14:03] <i_came_here_to_something> Not the whole plot but enough time to forget small details and specifics,

[14:15] <butter_my_bread> relax 

[14:15] <markymark52> what's the point of replaying the same game when he already has a completed 
playthrough. There's plenty of original games he could have played. 

[14:15] <eddiebrock> It doesn’t matter anymore. 

[14:15] <factorbactorjr> i really dont think he cares 
[14:15] <kingofhypocrisy> you want silent drives?

[14:15] <jmon_1985> We told him already. I'm not paying bits for that 
[14:16] <miguelkakarot> at least he is driving better in this game. 

[14:16] <rhinebtv> He seems to be owrried about content ID matching 
[14:16] <rhinebtv> That will avoid it

[14:22] <theycallmejimbob> yes BeTheLewd dspPepe 

[14:22] <factorbactorjr> the issue with this game is that sometimes the facial expressions are just random as fuck 
and have no real tells about what it is the right option 
[14:22] <solid_shock7> howdy all 
[14:22] <adr525> not suspicious ;) 

[14:22] <theycallmejimbob> hey Solid_Shock7 KonCha 
[14:23] <kizveli> If you ask Phil, the old trope is Bad cop, Bad cop 



[14:23] <theycallmejimbob> slow and steady Phil NotLikeThis 

[14:23] <butter_my_bread> later phil will vote good cop under the theory it hasn’t been right in awhile lol

[14:23] <theycallmejimbob> hey luke2000 KonCha 

[14:23] <markymark52> cheer 15 you know there are plenty of original games that you could play instead of a 
mediocrely rated re-release. 

[14:24] <luke2000> Hi I thought that Phil was talking about me to do with music and stuff lol 

[14:24] <superslygaming> u know ur a real jerk off phelps 

[14:24] <rotoch4mp> phil keeping a low profile

[14:25] <afarcryaway> To be fair, Phil is getting more views on this than Okami HD (another re-release) xD 
[14:25] <kingofhypocrisy> tru 

[14:25] <fulhnetalcrusade> @darksydephil would you ever consider smoking pot on stream since its legal there

[14:25] <superslygaming> PogChamp okami hd 

[14:25] <kizveli> I really wish I had any money so I could donate it to Phil, who appreciates it less than africans 
appreciate colonialism 

[14:25] <jdcherdy> comes in late, cuz people gotta see the stream from start to finish and don’t got other things 
to do lol 

[14:25] <horror_duck_l> For trophy hype!!! 

[14:26] <i_came_here_to_something> Okami is the better game, but this is better for streams 



[14:26] <butter_my_bread> the premier streams usually do better such was the casefor Okami as well 

[14:26] <jmon_1985> ResidentSleeper 
[14:26] <sofiarayne> lmao 

[14:26] <afarcryaway> @I_Came_Here_To_Something I agree xD

[14:26] <markymark52> @Butter_My_Bread I actually am positive AND give him shit.

original games he hasn't played yet.

[14:31] <kingofhypocrisy> he escaped from the circus and started his livestream career 
[14:31] <megapellicanl> Is this the nude mission? 

[14:31] <jbowler21> this is the die case 

[14:31] <i_came_here_to_something> @lButtonDash I think we might have a similar thought in this Kappa 

[14:31] <mrmaymayman> conan the barbarian he wants to help dsp with his tax problems 

[14:31] <superslygaming> destiny is like a debate streamer or some shit 

[14:31] <conan_the_barbarian> probably should mind his own business 

[14:31] <succkonlemon> 1,829 viewers dspShock 



[14:31] <super_slade> Destiny is popular as he is short 

[14:31] <kingofhypocrisy> @conan_the_barbarian he gets all his attention fro bringing other ppl on his stream to 
argue with thm 

[14:32] <bionich00t> Phil should really give Destiny a shout out for the raid 

[14:32] <glorytobeh> no plates much diplomacy wow 

[14:32] <wjr02003> @darksydephil This is one of the DLC cases 

[14:32] <darkandfullofterrors> >someone hosts a streamer >"he should mind his own business" Nice attutude 

@conan_the_barbarian LuL 

[14:32] <i_came_here_to_something> He won’t 

[14:32] <narnoldpt> Destiny is a former SC2 pro who loves DSP and wants to talk to him 
[14:32] <thatoneasianguy 18> @darkandfullofterrors lul 
[14:32] <jlb8> wow the view jump, fishier than ariels vag MingLee 
[14:32] <dariusirl> Wait are you actually ignoring the host? 

[14:32] <kingofhypocrisy> Destiny and Jim should have another debate Kappa 
[14:32] <dariusirl> Why are you ignoring a 2k viewer host? 

[14:32] <bionich00t> .... 

[14:32] <superslygaming> destiny and dsp should collab 
[14:32] <jesterkl> Thats my country FeelsBadMan 
[14:33] <bionich00t> Phil shouldn’t ignore the host. 

[14:33] <glorytobeh> dsp and pewdiepie should colab 
[14:33] <bionich00t> It's actually nice 

[14:33] <mrmaymayman> the destiny and dsp collab would be so entertaining 
[14:33] <iradiumviking> I think it's not a host but viewbots and garbage comments 
[14:33] <thatoneasianguy 18> @darksydephil stop ignoring the chat 
[14:33] <rqkai> @glorytobeh lmao 

[14:33] <averyfinechippy> phil wont do it because hes a fraud 
[14:33] <bionich00t> No people were raiding with Destiny emotes 

[14:33] <darkandfullofterrors> @dariusirl Destiny has been trying to reach out and talk to DSP to help him out 
with his economic shit, DSP is ignoring him FeelsBadMan 
[14:33] <jlb8> they stuck flag up victim bumhole MingLee 

[14:33] <duderito2> didn’t Phil interact with that Destiny dood months ago and said he wants nothing to do with 
him 

[14:33] <chairmancaleb> Why would he acknowledge some troll raid? 

[14:33] <bionich00t> Unless a bunch of Destiny subs false flagged it but come on that's bs 
[14:33] <kizveli> How can Phil have any following when he laughs at donators and ignores hosts 
[14:33] <dariusirl> @iradiumviking ?? what he literally hosted him. 

[14:33] <emryl> Phil is just oblivious to a lot lol 

[14:33] <superslygaming> somebody bullshitted that destiny raided him lololol 
[14:33] <narnoldpt> No it was a host, we are not bots. 

[14:33] <lbuttondash> @dariusirl well it's hard to tell when the chat went into follower mode only, how the heck 

would he notice unless he keeps looking at the view count which he's not 

[14:33] <jannedaarcl35> I like how the criminals conveniently leave evidence behind :p 

[14:33] <thatoneasianguy 18> someone donate him a bit so can he read the chat 

[14:33] <superslygaming> destiny isnt hosting anybody 

[14:33] <iradiumviking> how do you no @NarnoldPT it was just spam messages 
[14:33] <pinkdam> didn't phil delete destiny from his hard drive? 

[14:33] <bionich00t> Don't be dumb there were 10s of Destiny subs who came in 

[14:33] <i_came_here_to_something> @iradiumviking but when it first happened a whole bunch of people were 
saying "Raid" and "Destiny" 

[14:33] <mrmaymayman> can you imagine some pubg duos with destiny and dsp :D 
[14:34] <i_came_here_to_something> then the room went into followers-only 

[14:34] <narnoldpt> @iradiumviking I was watching Destiny, he was looking for someone to host. He hosted 



Phil cause he wants to talk to him about Taxes 

[14:34] <dariusirl> @iradiumviking go to destinys twitch channel??? it says hes hosting him 
[14:34] <dlmech> hey friends, Phil:) 

[14:34] <zukyun> destiny is the worst game of the year 
[14:34] <superslygaming> how is phil unaware of all of this 
[14:34] <iradiumviking> is destiny a troll? 

[14:34] <timboslicegb> this game looks so good 

[14:34] <bethelewd> uh oh mexicans

[14:35] <narnoldpt> @iradiumviking No he's not a troll, he was a pro gamer, and wants to helpo 

[14:35] <averyfinechippy> phil 

[14:35] <conan_the_barbarian> a know it all asshole? 

[14:35] <duderito2> pretty much conan the barbarian 

[14:35] <thedoctor5437> why does this guy look like ted’s father from bill and ted? 

[14:35] <iconicmasterl> FailFish 

[14:35] <kushiyakitori> hosting gives new viewers to someone, not to disturb 
[14:35] <zukyun> I love this old guys acting 

[14:35] <bionich00t> @iradiumviking this happens all the time on Twitch. You're meant to thank the hoster 
when they give you 2k viewers. 

[14:35] <timboslicegb> lie 

[14:35] <bionich00t> It's not a troll dude 

[14:35] <jlb8> it is that guy! 

[14:35] <kingofhypocrisy> Destiny is an attention whore 
[14:35] <averyfinechippy> most viewers phil has ever had lol 
[14:35] <txstormsurge> Mexican is a bastardizarion of Spanish 
[14:35] <dlmech> hello friend @theycallmejimbob CoolCat 

[14:35] <conan_the_barbarian> i have known guys in irl like this destiny guy who think they are better than 
everyone else 

[14:35] <jlb8> that's were he from, good call! 

[14:35] <bethelewd> viking a lot of people go and riot in their friends chat as support to them 

[14:35] <iradiumviking> why would he care about phil? If it is the desteny i have heard of. He debates people on 

politics and shit 

[14:35] <super_slade> Destiny is a hobbit who should be dealing with the One Ring 

[14:35] <lbuttondash> i bet this old guy has constipation 

[14:35] <bionich00t> I don’t like Destiny but the host was a good thing 



[14:36] <superslygaming> destiny IS hosting dsp. destiny is also on YT 
[14:36] <bethelewd> but this is nothing to do with phil 
[14:36] <bionich00t> It's like Destiny donated Phil viewers 

[14:36] <i_came_here_to_something> @KingOfHypocrisy At least he shut JonTron up 
[14:36] <bethelewd> and it fucks our chat 
[14:36] <thebigtjl337> LOL

[14:36] <kizveli> subtle Kappa 

[14:36] <alumpymoose> destiny wants to help you 

[14:36] <zukyun> totally legit 

[14:36] <darkandfullofterrors> @conan_the_barbarian How much of Destiny have you watched? Why are you 
so negative towards someone who just hosted DSP? 

[14:36] <alumpymoose> he deson’t bite 

[14:36] <conan_the_barbarian> i think DSP had more than 2000 viewers without anyone hosting him before 
[14:36] <bethelewd> ONE GOT THROUGH 

[14:36] <superslygaming> yeah destiny isnt a troll i think, he might have liked dsp Christmas stream 

[14:36] <mrmaymayman> @iradiumviking destiny's a good guy and enjoys dsps streams, when he saw dsp was 

in some trouble he figured he could help him out as a fellow streamer 

[14:36] <wjr02003> @darksydephil You actually got a code for this case since it was originally a PS3 exclusive 
but you never entered it due to PSN being down at the time. 

[14:36] <jesterkl> my flag BibleThump 

[14:36] <lacroixbbboi> too many viewers makes this slow chat go too fast! 

[14:36] <narnoldpt> It is the same Destiny, Destiny is just a fan of Phil and has some tax experience and wants to 
help that's all. 

[14:36] <splashfuzz> I think he's telling the truth. 

[14:36] <lbuttondash> wtf does a car keep screetching? 

[14:36] <super_slade> It's probably Maradona on another coke bender 

[14:37] <braenstus> @BeTheLewd dont you want phil to be able to pay his taxes thanks to all these new viewers 
nathanPepe 

[14:37] <bionich00t> Destiny is a fan of Phil lol? 

[14:37] <bionich00t> What? 

[14:37] <horror_duck_l> that face was hilarious 

[14:37] <duderito2> least this destiny raid will get Phil closer to 50k followers 

[14:37] <noahcw> @iradiumviking ya destiny pretty chill but phil blocked him and wont talk to him for some 
reason 

[14:37] <chocolaterampage30> looool 

[14:37] <dariusirl> @BeTheLewd yeah it must really suck when someone gives another person viewers so the 
slow chat goes faster. LMFAO 
[14:37] <milkgotzgames> just back out 

[14:37] <i_came_here_to_something> And people wonder why streamers don’t host or raid DSP streams that 



often :/... 

[14:37] <gratefulloc> forsenOMEGA 

[14:37] <mrmaymayman> @Bionich00t 100% he's watched a ton of dsp vids on his stream 
[14:37] <duderito2> Noahcw pretty chill :LUL 

[14:37] <lbuttondash> i watched Avoiding the puddle play this, was so fucking funnt 
[14:37] <bionich00t> Yeah Phil should shout out Destiny for the raid 
[14:37] <sofiarayne> back out 
[14:37] <bionich00t> It's NOT a troll Phil 

[14:37] <iradiumviking> ok can Destiny contact phil or whatever? I don't think raiding the stream will do any 
good anyways. 

[14:37] <sofiarayne> think about it 

[14:37] <donkyschlong69> 1.2k viewers. Woohoo. 

[14:37] <superslygaming> why did phil block destiny? 

[14:37] <noahcw> @iradiumviking na he left thats why he hosted him 
[14:37] <jdcherdy> phil could always contact him, too. 

[14:37] <iconicmasterl> CoolStoryBob 

[14:37] <conan_the_barbarian> lol DSP is completely ignoring all the destiny stuff on chat 
[14:37] <thebigtjl337> destiny is a turbo cuck 

[14:37] <braenstus> what kind of mods get mad at people hosting LuL 

[14:37] <bionich00t> Even if it was an attempt to troll... he raided you for 2000 viewers! Thank him anyway 
[14:37] <dariusirl> @iradiumviking it will give him viewers and let him know? shut up you're complaining 
about free views lmfao 

[14:38] <thatoneasianguy 18> phil noone gives a fuck about this game lol anymore PogChamp PogChamp 

[14:38] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm 

[14:38] <kekon3> I think it's a little rude 

[14:38] <noahcw> darius chill my dude 

[14:38] <wimblex> iradiumviking it's just a host? 

[14:38] <kekon3> but uh, who is Destiny? 

[14:38] <mrmaymayman> @iradiumviking i think dsp thinks destiny is a troll or something, but he honestly 
wants to help dsp 

[14:38] <iradiumviking> how about you watch the gameplay and sto bitching @dariusirl 

[14:38] <trihard41iife> hey everyone TriHard 7 

[14:38] <wimblex> rude to host LuL 

[14:38] <theycallmejimbob> hey TriHard4Liife :D 

[14:38] <flic_> How do non of the mods know what a host is? 

[14:38] <jesterkl> oh, 1946, the year Argentina started to decay FeelsBadMan 
[14:38] <dariusirl> @iradiumviking you're the one bitching about a host retard 
[14:38] <jlb8> gameplay LUL 
[14:38] <braenstus> @iradiumviking haHAA m 

[14:38] <rotoch4mp> why not just watch the game and stop slander like court ladys 

[14:38] <gratefulloc> the only people I see that are upset are the mods forsenOMEGA 

[14:38] <noahcw> @Kekon3 he plays games and is into politics on his stream, just a streamer like phil 

[14:38] <lutherkujo> cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl Sup Phil,hope 

your having a decent day today just got myself the new 2DS XL as a Christmas gift for myself 

[14:38] <glorytobeh> if this destiny guy is such a huge fan why doesnt he sub to Phil? 

[14:38] <iradiumviking> I know what a host is but it doesn’t say anywhere for me 
[14:38] <iconicmasterl> 5Y~± 

[14:38] <dirtydawg392> idiot mods for an idiot streamer LUL 

[14:38] <narnoldpt> @Kekon3 A very lage streamer, averages like 4 k viewers. 

[14:38] <bionich00t> Phil is just paranoid I guess, but raids are a good thing. He hosts people as well. I don’t get 
it. 

[14:38] <gamerl 109> Didn't Phil already play this? 



[14:39] <narnoldpt> large* 

[14:39] <iradiumviking> It looks similar to viewbots and spam when people just spam the chat 
[14:39] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob you played 1A¥ noire original? 

[14:39] <i_came_here_to_something> If another streamer already raids or hosts a streamer, it should be good 
courtesy of the streamer getting hosted/raided to reach out and thank the one hosting/raiding them. 

[14:39] <noahcw> @iradiumviking phil can see he was hosted but it doesnt show on stream 
[14:39] <kingofhypocrisy> where are GTAB's? 

[14:39] <kekon3> Another streamer? coolio I guess but my b, never heard of em :((( 

[14:39] <gratefulloc> they were spamming sub only emotes to a designated channel that is displayed when 
hovered over. 

[14:39] <kushiyakitori> you can literally go to the guys channel and see that he is hosting phil. its not viewbot 
[14:39] <braenstus> 0 iq mods think hosts are viewbots LuL 

[14:39] <theycallmejimbob> I played it for a bit TriHard4Liife but I haven’t completed it how about yourself 
[14:39] <darkandfullofterrors> @iradiumviking Go to destinys twitch page and you'll see he is hosting dsp 
[14:39] <iradiumviking> @Noahcw yea so how does that help me? 

[14:39] <dlmech> why is destiny hosting Phil? lol 
[14:39] <superslygaming> this is weird 

[14:39] <flic_> @iradiumviking Why would a view bot spam destiny sub emotes? LUL 

[14:39] <jbowler21> it's not PlayStation exclusive anymore, i got this game on xbl and can play this case along 
with all other die missions. 

[14:39] <bionich00t> No way Phil didn’t see he was raided, he's just ignoring it because ??? 

[14:39] <jdcherdy> he’s not gonna thank unless they cheer, sub or tip 
[14:39] <noahcw> @iradiumviking help you with what> 

[14:39] <jesterkl> Dude legit is hosting phil 

[14:39] <lacroixbbboi> aren't mods usually more informed than this? 

[14:39] <dariusirl> @iradiumviking Yeah i understand that you're use too a slow chat going 1 message per 15 
minutes,. But this is what a active chat looks like. 

[14:39] <iradiumviking> I don’t know i don't follow destiny i haven’t seen his emotes 

[14:39] <bethelewd> viking this is not a host it is a riot aka a guy or girl comes in and SPAMS chat with emotes

[14:39] <orcsrdorks7> thats nice of him 

[14:39] <fulhnetalcrusade> @darksydephil phil u should take advantage of being in Washington and smoke a 
bowl on stream 

[14:39] <gratefulloc> Why are the mods pretending to be confused? forsenThink 
[14:39] <bionich00t> Just hover over them @iradiumviking it’ll tell you the base channel 
[14:39] <encephalolz> Looks like a troll raid.

[15:14] <i_came_here_to_something> @qu4ck_ Sub and follower count doesn't mean everything tho. Regular 
viewer count is usually around 400 or so on 1st streams, 200-300 on 2nd. IIRC he got better numbers on Youtube 
(average #s, not talking about premier streams or special events like the Christmas Games stream which was fun 
for NiGHTS and Home Alone :) )

[15:19] <lunar_rabs> for a raid this fizzled out faster than Destiny's career 
[15:19] <averyfinechippy> @duderito2 you like pig roach? 

[15:19] <evvaade> Why would my main man host this guy?

song about why the rain is heavy. 

[15:19] <qu4ck_> tbh not surprising it fizzled out the way phil reacted to it lrnao

[15:21] <conan_the_barbarian> will @DarksydePhil play MG survive? 

[15:21] Macroixbbboi> @favre_da_bom are you being ironic or?

[15:23] <wjr02003> @darksydephil Are any of the subs either tier 2 or 3? Those are worth more sub points so 
that could be what's happening. Tier 2 counts as 2 subs and tier 3 counts as 6. 

[15:24] <favre_da_bom> Why can't people just enjoy gameplay. Who cares about all other drama from other 

streamers. Trolls need to get a life and be more productive

[15:43] <bethelewd> i caught it so it didnt go to waste i just let it go after 
[15:44] <dukaduka> AngelThump 

[15:44] <mikethegamerdude> i’d love to see a la noire sequel 
[15:44] <narrowmindedness> FeelsAmazingMan 

[15:44] <kinggoken> the company that made this game got shut down...I think 



[15:44] <dukaduka> @Kinggoken not the company, because it's rockstar, but the studio and team ran into a 

bunch of development problems and closed sadly 

[15:45] <kinggoken> right. Yeah the studio 

[15:45] <bethelewd> there is more evidence tthen 

[15:45] <bethelewd> look in the alley phil 

[15:45] <dukaduka> @BeTheLewd spoilers please 

[15:45] <mikethegamerdude> @killallgoogles rockstar might make the a sequel 

[15:45] <zukyun> alley 

[15:46] <kingofhypocrisy> Katy Perry 

[15:46] <mikethegamerdude> *a sequel 

[15:46] <sofiarayne> u said she looked like a dude in the original playthrough 
[15:46] <bethelewd> i think they have plans for a sequel to la noire 
[15:46] <youngcud> Let all that you do be done in love 
[15:46] <bethelewd> prob not true though 

[15:46] <dukaduka> the alley evidence actually open up another way to solve this case 
[15:46] <hungrymaggot> This is my partner MR do nothing 
[15:46] <bethelewd> but first up is red dead 

[15:46] <dukaduka> If they do make a second one, it won’t look anything like this, the face capture was too 
expensive 

[15:46] <bcawk> ACCUSE 
[15:46] <bethelewd> LIAR 
[15:47] <hungrymaggot> KILL 
[15:47] <bcawk> MAME 

[15:47] <dukaduka> i’m worried red dead will be the first rockstar game to not meet expectations 
[15:47] <infinite_sphere> She's kinda cute 
[15:47] <dukaduka> says the mad men actress 

[15:47] <mikethegamerdude> @dukaduka Thats fine the mo cap in gtav is pretty good 
[15:48] <bethelewd> WOAH 

[15:48] <bcawk> I remember this mission from the original playthrough 
[15:48] <infinite_sphere> thats one bloody knife WutFace 
[15:48] <dukaduka> @MikeTheGamerDude but it's nowhere near as good as this 
[15:48] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[15:48] <mikethegamerdude> @BeTheLewd can’t wait for rdr2 

[15:48] <bausleyfred> ill go with steak knife 

[15:49] <mikethegamerdude> @dukaduka yeah its not 

[15:49] <kingofhypocrisy> @dukaduka Red Dead Online will be shit like gta online, shark cards 
[15:49] <infinite_sphere> look at im climbing LUL 
[15:49] <encephalolz> That knife must be covered in seasoning. Kappa 
[15:49] <kingofhypocrisy> gotta make it a grindy mess so ppl will pay to win 

[15:50] <dukaduka> @KingOfHypocrisy i wonder if Rockstar was making it more microtransaction/ lootbox 

heavy, because if so, people are going to be upset 

[15:50] <jefoliveira902> Phils wants the D 

[15:50] <milkgotzgames> back door was golden 

[15:50] <bethelewd> he has to find a d 

[15:50] <kushiyakitori> Phil is on the prowl looking for some D 
[15:50] <plizzat5> cantsanjaaa 
[15:50] <sofiarayne> did you check the alley 
[15:50] <leonaras> " i have to find a D " - DSP 2017 

[15:50] <dukaduka> also gta online turned into basically saints row 4 and that's not good 
[15:50] <mikethegamerdude> The face cap in infamous second sun is pretty good too 

[15:50] <encephalolz> Rockstar is most likely not going to give a fuck and push for microtransactions, just like 
they did with gta 5 lodRaughs 



[15:51] <kingofhypocrisy> @dukaduka There is a quote floating around from the Take-Two ceo who said there 
wasn't enough microtransactions in gta online so that's not a good sign 

[15:51] <dukaduka> @MikeTheGamerDude agreed it is pretty good, people forget about that game 
[15:51] <jefoliveira902> Skidmarks, goddamit 
[15:51] <sofiarayne> did you check the ALLEY? 

[15:51] <bethelewd> i know but im not telling 
[15:51] <obltv> lol 

[15:51] <bcawk> Did you check all the tables at the bar 
[15:51] <youngcud> No weapons formed against me shall prosper 
[15:51] <dukaduka> @KingOfHypocrisy wow, im sad now

[15:52] <conan_the_barbarian> cheer50 #charity what is your favorite and least favorite fast food joint? 

[15:53] <kingofhypocrisy> @dukaduka i have low expectations for RDR online tbh :( 

[15:53] <iradiumviking> good for you @PiratesEngineer 

[15:53] <encephalolz> The game publishers know that the consumers only have enough steam to revolt once or 
twice before they fizzle out. EA got the brunt. Bungie is getting a weak second wave. 

[15:53] <dukaduka> yeah like weed courtney Kappa 

[15:53] <encephalolz> By the time RDR 2 comes around, Rockstar knows ppl will have grown complacent. 
[15:53] <piratesengineer> @iradiumviking thanks, and happy holiday xmas/newYear 
[15:54] <milkgotzgames> little ceasers is trash 

[15:54] <bethelewd> 5Y—5YD LIVE LONG AND PROSPER 

[15:54] <iradiumviking> goo bethe keep try! 

[15:54] <mikethegamerdude> we never got those gtav single player die 
[15:54] <conan_the_barbarian> rdr 2 is delayed until 2019 i think 
[15:54] <bethelewd> whaaaaaaa 

[15:54] <dukaduka> @KingOfHypocrisy gta online had to go through to get off the ground, so hopefully they 
know how to make an online service now 

[15:54] <kingofhypocrisy> @encephalolz tons of people bought shark cards so they will be fine as long as they 

don’t get too greedy 

[15:55] <dukaduka> *go through alot 

[15:55] <piratesengineer> booze law
