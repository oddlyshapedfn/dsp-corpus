[19:48] <lvlpower> 10:47pm 

[19:48] <popsicolo> Youtube algorith is busted. There's a huge issue where people are making videos of 
Superheroes and princess doing nasty shit and they still get ads.

get caught and everything's been overturned for him except 2 videos ever. The algorithm is broken by most 
accounts.

[19:49] <blue_blur64> And videos that get reviewed and monetized get re-demonitized xD 
[19:49] <popsicolo> There are toy channels where they abuse children that get ads NotLikeThis 
[19:50] <bentboxer> toy review channels rake in big dough 

[19:50] <thatanonybear> There was a youtube channel where these parents would tell their son his family all 
died to record his horrified reaction, and they were never demonetized.

he can get more ads KappaHD

[20:12] <brahski20> @Eternia_Forever I think with pig's the key is to just whip them more harder so they run 
faster 



[20:12] <popsicolo> If you want a pig to run fast, put a Bandicoot on it's back. 

[20:12] <brahski20> @Popsicolo No you need to whip it more harder

[20:41] <blue_blur64> He’ll probably play it, but I doubt it’d be on launch day 

[20:41] <kyoyami> Kiwami short he can finish it quickly 

[20:42] <nightbot> thesupervillain543 just tipped $3.00 

[20:42] <eternia_forever> tip hype 

[20:43] <smackhammerl> I honestly hated this year in gaming 

[20:43] <mizorelover> Sucks Phil won't even consider Persona 5 for GOTY, which currently has the $1 spot for 
me. :( 

[20:43] <xxghostbritxx> mvci game of the year 
[20:43] <mizorelover> #1* 

[20:43] <blue_blur64> Well he never beat it so he can't 

[20:43] <eternia_forever> Man i sure hope they keep doin the mid cycle refresh of consoles so we get new 
consoles every 3 years 

[20:43] <kyoyami> True, I played more games this year than any other year. Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, Persona 5, 
Horizon, Nioh, Nier Automata, Sonic Mania, etc. Great year. 

[20:43] <thesupervillain543> whats up guys 
[20:44] <blue_blur64> That I have no idea xD 
[20:44] <eternia_forever> @thesupervillain543 hi 

[20:44] <easton_taylorl> @darksydephil now the box spawn, go back to the hill, make a stair and there should 
be a ledge to grab 



[20:44] <blue_blur64> Another thing that he can't get as Mario 

[20:44] <kyoyami> I hate mid cycle refresh of consoles because I feel like I need it right away and get the first or 
second model. 

[20:45] <mizorelover> I still have the OG PS4 and it's going strong, lol 
[20:45] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I wonder if hea€™ll get the moon on keep? 

[20:45] <blue_blur64> same here Mizore 

[20:45] <eternia_forever> what you mean 1st or 2nd model @kyoyami 

[20:45] <smackhammerl> I got a ps4 for bloodborne before the pro and before I knew it was only 30 frames. 

You can say I was a little disappointed 

[20:45] <mizorelover> Granted, I have PT on this thing so even when I upgrade I’ll be keeping it. 

[20:46] <kyoyami> @Eternia_Forever Like this gen I have the first model of the Xbox One and I have the 
refresh of the base PS4 which had the matte finish in 2015.

X;D 

[20:47] <mechaboomkin> nah, he rage quitted 

[20:47] <aes0411> How's everyone doing? I am playing Doom on the Switch and I am immediately disappointed 
by the fact that you cannot play with bots offline. WTF? 

[20:47] <neospartanhesperos9> Are there any power stars in this game 
[20:47] <blue_blur64> It's like doing the dive above water 
[20:47] <smackhammerl> Probably y or shake 

[20:47] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> I dona€™t thinks therea€™s any power ups 
[20:47] <doctorzzz> probably motion controled 
[20:48] <doctorzzz> to dash 

[20:48] <eternia_forever> oh i see, well i am fine paying 400 dollars for a top of the line console that will last 3 

years then get the new one thats only 133 dollars and some change a year so yeah @kyoyami 

[20:48] <thatanonybear> @aes0411 sup fam tsosWave playing MVC:I and kicking ass

[21:46] <mizorelover> Did he get the one with all the assholes on the ceiling? 

[21:46] <thesupervillain543> is this game fun to play? 

[21:46] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever but even then, expect to be disappointed 
[21:46] <thesupervillain543> seems a little too slow paced 
[21:46] <popsicolo> The Ninja Turtles are coming to Injustice 2 NotLikeThis 
[21:47] <multihog> it's better than big rigs 

[21:47] <blue_blur64> Is it the live action movie version Pop? Kappa 
[21:47] <blue_blur64> You’re near it

[21:47] <popsicolo> No. 

[21:47] <popsicolo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rXE2RjinkU 

[21:47] <eternia_forever> cool but let me ask you what does Burger King have to do with it BK as you say 
@That AnonyB ear 

[21:48] <the_guardiann> you passed it. Its in the hallway with the fishes swimming 
[21:48] <the_guardiann> archway 

[21:48] <thesupervillain543> @Popsicolo i stopped playing that game anyway because they didnt improve the 
zoning cheese 

[21:48] <thesupervillain543> waste of 60 bucks 

[21:48] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever Banjo Kazooie o_0 fast food is death 

[21:48] <mizorelover> I think you missed the one where you have to dodge passed all the upside down seaweed 
dudes. @DarksydePhil 

[21:49] <popsicolo> My favorite TMNT episode is the one where they gored a watermelon. 

[21:49] <secretbossfight> zoning? 

[21:49] <blue_blur64> brownLUL 

[21:49] <thesupervillain543> @SecretBossFight repetitive use of projectiles 
[21:49] <blue_blur64> It deserved it Pop 
[21:49] <madibased> Lolz 

[21:49] <popsicolo> Maybe it did, but I didn't deserve to see it happen NotLikeThis 

[21:49] <blue_blur64> Too bad Kappa 

[21:50] <multihog> yep, nothing he could do there 




[21:50] <matitoooo> Seaside was the most annoying kingdom for me in my opinion 
[21:50] <blue_blur64> Go to the left right now 

[21:50] <eternia_forever> lol alright, i couldn’t think of what bk was so i went to google and typed bk game and 
the xbox 360 burger king game came up lol, although i knew that was not what you were talking bout and i was 
just joking lol 

[21:50] <eternia_forever> @ThatAnonyBear 
[21:51] <blue_blur64> Not that one D: 

[21:51] <blue_blur64> Ok, where the beach is, go straight forward 
[21:51] <blue_blur64> Volleyball I meant 

[21:51] <blue_blur64> There is a challenge door to the left of that 
[21:51] <the_guardiann> above that one theres another archway 

[21:51] <mizorelover> lol You and I are trying so hard @blue_blur64 Gotta keep up the fight. XD 
[21:51] <blue_blur64> SwiftRage 

[21:51] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever haha, but if you've never played Banjo Kazooie and don't have a 
fond spot for those games, I can’t really recommend it. It's a rough game tbh. 

[21:52] <blue_blur64> Ok, to the left of where those blocks were Phil 
[21:52] <multihog> backseating is encouraged here? 

[21:52] <blue_blur64> Saying that there was no door there xD 
[21:52] <the_guardiann> go to first archway and its above that one 
[21:52] <matitoooo> @darksydephil maybe try checking the hallways in the glass palace 
[21:53] <the_guardiann> ground pound blocks he means 

[21:53] <blue_blur64> I'm sorry, I'm trying to explain but because of the water it's hard to describe 
[21:53] <thatanonybear> go to the place with the thing 

[21:53] <revolver_devil> @DarksydePhil "Insert Completely Unhelpful Hint Here!" 

[21:53] <pinkdam> to the left of where you just were 

[21:53] <mizorelover> It isn't a door but where there's a bunch of upside down seaweed guys there's a glowing 

spot. Ground pound it for a moon. @DarksydePhil 

[21:53] <thesupervillain543> this game reminds me of ffl5 

[21:53] <cjuphoria> Go to the place in the water..duh 

[21:53] <multihog> ffl5 sucked 

[21:54] <nexgrato> its in that one place with that stuff 

[21:54] <the_guardiann> past sphinx above where the fishes swim, theres another archway 

[21:54] <blue_blur64> Remember where you had to ground pound on some blocks to get a moon underground? 

To the left of that is the door 

[21:54] <abeyyvaly> hows the job search going? 

[21:54] <eternia_forever> yeah i have never for some reason played a bk game although i know people have a 
fondness for them, i will have to watch some trailers for the game yeah it can be had for less then 20 new 
@That AnonyB ear 

[21:54] <dukexjt> Burger King game? 

[21:54] <blue_blur64> I’M SORRY brownFEELS 

[21:55] <blue_blur64> Not in the hole or hallway, it's higher up 

[21:55] <the_guardiann> door is hidden behind some seaweed. 

[21:55] <eternia_forever> @dukexjt lol no banjo kazooe 

[21:55] <mizorelover> He just passed the other one. lol Backseat gaming with this chat delay is a right bitch. 
[21:55] <the_guardiann> above blocks, second archway 

[21:55] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever there's a lot of charm and simplicity to the Banjo games lost in YL 

[21:55] <dukexjt> lol sorry 

[21:55] <the_guardiann> phil please
