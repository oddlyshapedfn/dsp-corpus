[11:35] <bethelewd> gamemaster welcome to my world 

[11:35] <atlastelamon9> Just read the news. Pretty serious train wreck 

[11:35] <darksydephil> this is like the 5th major train wreck since i moved 

[11:35] <darksydephil> seems like the train infrastructure in the USA is falling apart 

[11:36] <atlastelamon9> Bad engineering I guess 

[11:36] <atlastelamon9> Seven wagons falling of on to the road 

[11:36] <majinboo3> Train travel is irrelevant in the US its not like in europe 

[11:36] <majinboo3> where trains mean something 

[11:36] <atlastelamon9> In Europe its pretty good 

[11:36] <atlastelamon9> Semi-governmentally run 

[11:36] <bethelewd> im ready for lag switch users 

[11:36] <bethelewd> :P 

[11:37] <majinboo3> America is without a doubt a car country 

[11:37] <deepdrive3254> trains use to be vital in the us 

[11:37] <majinboo3> only thing americans like more then cars is guns 

[11:37] <darksydephil> i cant believe that one fucking guy from last session who obviously had his internet 

fucked so the match wuld slow down 

[11:37] <darksydephil> what a turd he was 

[11:37] <deepdrive3254> now noone trusts amtrack for anything but being late 

[11:37] <majinboo3> everyones desperate to win online 

[11:37] <majinboo3> even if they have to be cheating bitches 

[11:37] <kozatof> @deepdrive3254 mod eh 

[11:37] <darksydephil> amtrak was actually good on the east coast, it was WAY better than the other Metro 
North lines 

[11:37] <darksydephil> more reliable and more comfortable 

[11:38] <atlastelamon9> No one will travel Portland - Seattle again on that track 

[11:38] <darksydephil> seriously this sucks atlastelamon9 be that was a major tourist rail and i hoped to take it 
some day 

[11:38] <deepdrive3254> thats good to hear 

[11:38] <darksydephil> rather than drive down there which would take forever 
[11:38] <majinboo3> oh wait this was in dupont LOL 
[11:38] <majinboo3> SAY NO MRe 
[11:38] <majinboo3> MORE 

[11:38] <majinboo3> That place is absolute shit no wonder that train derailed 
[11:39] <atlastelamon9> Would you take the change after today Phil? 

[11:39] <atlastelamon9> Chance 



[11:39] <kozatof> Hey so @darksydephil the escort lady is trying to create a narrative that you watch wolf wolf 
stuff 

[11:39] <theycallmejimbob> viscera cleanup detail hype VoHiYo 
[11:40] <darksydephil> kozatof, are you a moron? 

[11:40] <majinboo3> dude the people on twitter are mentally retarded lol 
[11:40] <kozatof> No 

[11:40] <darksydephil> sorry i have to ask, because you seem to think there actually is an "escort lady" lol 

[11:40] <superbatcat> hey phil 

[11:40] <kozatof> Oh shea€™s fake account? 

[11:40] <majinboo3> Just because one train derailed americas infrastructure is falling apart lol please 

[11:40] <darksydephil> no shit, sherlock 

[11:40] <kozatof> I couldna€™t tell 

[11:40] <nich2440> Maybe he’s just fucking around Phil? 

[11:40] <kozatof> It seemed too good to be true 

[11:40] <deepdrive3254> escort lady is probably just another dude on the internet 
[11:41] <atlastelamon9> US rail system is heavily in decline for years 

[11:41] <darksydephil> escort lady is a detractor catfish account, it's only insanely obvious if you actually read 
like, 2 tweets 

[11:41] <atlastelamon9> Look at Japan 
[11:41] <superbatcat> Are we on this again really 
[11:41] <kozatof> Ahhh alright thanks @darksydephil 
[11:41] <atlastelamon9> We are live! 

[11:42] <majinboo3> the best part are the people blaming trump for it like what lol 
[11:42] <majinboo3> he has nothing at all to do what happened 

[11:42] <kozatof> I was like therea€™s no way phil would hire anyone @darksydephil 

[11:42] <darksydephil> this dark souls remix is amazing, the video is even better, and it has less than lk views 

on youtube 

[11:42] <darksydephil> youtube is seriously total shit these days

[11:43] <majinboo3> the highest viewed remix is the motorstorm Apocalypse one i believe 
[11:43] <majinboo3> it has pretty good views 

[11:43] <kozatof> Are all these videos in the same order ? Do you ever mix them up 

[11:43] <kozatof> Cause it seems thugs on the floor always plays while others are missed out on like heavy rain 
[11:44] <yoursaltygymsocks> Hey phil and chat KonCha

get played 



[11:45] <nich2440> Yeah I put a lot of work into a video and got 0 views from search. Only from my friends.

[11:45] <theycallmejimbob> this remix :D 

[11:45] <darksydephil> just because you dont always hear the ones you like doesn't mean they dont play, it just

[11:47] <manyperegrine81> When did he sing this song haha 

[11:47] <leonaras> @Darksydephil Dont you think for the Christmas drinking stream it would have been a better 
idea to just do jackbox with patrons/everyone rather than the rather mediocre selection of Christmas games? Party 
games fit perfectly with the season. 

[11:47] <manyperegrine81> Say what you want about Phil. He is Good in improvising haha. Anyone remembers 
Ducktales 

[11:48] <darksydephil> nobody wants to see jackbox again, i ran that game into the ground 
[11:48] <darksydephil> and nobody wants detractor shit on Christmas

[11:56] <markymark52> cheerlO completely agree with you Phil. They did the same thing with the Wii when it 
was first released. 

[11:56] <theycallmejimbob> fair dues to Nintendo for being able to meet the demand for the holidays dspHmm 
[11:56] <superbatcat> Hey @theycallmejimbob hows it going? 

[11:56] <convertedclone> You could argue that for the SNES and NES classic, but there's nothing that shows 
that for the Switch 
[11:56] <yoitsque> alright

[12:00] <leonaras> Tbh, sales figures for the switch for the first 8 months of release are only slightly behind the 
PS4 on the same release period. 

[12:00] <jjbx22> but he didnt do good at lol 

[12:00] <zalenor> dude its was due to the screen, what a shitload of crap u are saying wiouth 

knowledge@DarksydePhil 

[12:01] <jjbx22> no he didnt lol? 

[12:01] <kittyspank> fokes 
[12:01] <majinboo3> yes he did 
[12:01] <majinboo3> he did finbe 
[12:01] <wxrxaxtxh> UMMM 
[12:01] <yoitsque> okay? 

[12:01] <jjbx22> o-o did you see how many times he died 
[12:01] <yoitsque> alkright 




[12:01] <majinboo3> for his first time playing the game he did alright 
[12:01] <jjbx22> o-o he was literally stuck on 1 boss for about 30 minutes 

[12:01] <convertedclone> listen guys, it's easy to make the switch, trust me my dad works at nintendo 

[12:01] <majinboo3> Your not understanding jjbx 

[12:01] <jjbx22> he did better in mgs2 and 3 than he did in 1 

[12:02] <yoitsque> not one "the bottom line is" yet im a bout to lose a bet 

[12:02] <kittyspank> its just a nvidia tablet 

[12:02] <kctronislife> are you saying it isnt @ConvertedClone FailFish 

[12:02] <theycallmejimbob> was your dad able to get nes classic ConvertedClone dspPepe 

[12:02] <kctronislife> stop being naive 

[12:02] <majinboo3> for 2 and 3 he fucked up the VERY BASICS of the damn game its not about toughness of 
the game lol 

[12:02] <kushiyakitori> @yoitsque he already said that during the Nintendo segment 
[12:02] <theycallmejimbob> a nes classic* 

[12:02] <majinboo3> its about not knowing the basics that he now knows 
[12:02] <kushiyakitori> @yoitsque so you won 
[12:02] <cutevermouth> is blaire dame in the demo? 

[12:02] <kekon3> I'm thinking you'll like Garuda 
[12:02] <yoitsque> oh fuck did he 

[12:02] <jjbx22> @majinboo3 did u even watch his mgsl playthrough o-o? 

[12:02] <kushiyakitori> yeah, he did 
[12:02] <yoitsque> alright 

[12:02] <yoitsque> honestly the bottom line is im glad i won that bet 

[12:02] <majinboo3> yes and he understood the basics of that game he wasnt great at it but he understood the 
basics 

[12:02] <datoneguyweallknow> I wouldn't mind if he added mgsl to the goal 

[12:02] <majinboo3> when he palyed 2 and 3 he had no fucking clue 

[12:03] <majinboo3> now stop fucking trolling 

[12:03] <kekon3> Garuda's got good footsies into normals 

[12:03] <jjbx22> @majinboo3 keep being to urself lawl 

[12:03] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[12:03] <bootytease> former pro fighting game player 

[12:03] <cutevermouth> phil do you look forward to soul calibur 6? 

[12:03] <kekon3> I mean footsies into specials 

[12:03] <convertedclone> no reason to think the switch is so much easier to produce than anything else just 
because it's a portable. It's still highly bespoke, and in fact uses even more customized parts than the other 
consoles 

[12:03] <jjbx22> >died more in mgsl than 2 and 3 didnt do bad 

[12:03] <theycallmejimbob> isn't there a dragonball fighting game coming out next month Kinggoken was sayng 
dspHmm 

[12:03] <sickogrind> Youre gonna hate this 

[12:03] <majinboo3> thats because if you want the god honest truth MGS 1 is fucknig shit compared to 2 and 3 
[12:03] <manyperegrine81> Is this a free beta? 

[12:03] <kittyspank> bespoke 
[12:03] <majinboo3> with alot of bullshit 

[12:03] <kekon3> speaking of fighters how did you feel about the soul calibur 6 announcement? muxylO 
[12:04] <majinboo3> hes not a big fan of soul caliber 
[12:04] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe cheating already 
[12:04] <cutevermouth> wtf would you cheat? 

[12:04] <jjbx22> @majinboo3 lawl

[12:04] <yoitsque> just not a normal day without @majinboo3 getting upset about something LUL 



[12:04] <retrojim_> Their are rumors DOA6 may be announced soon 
[12:04] <theycallmejimbob> no it's being put on hold skumbaghorse 
[12:04] <majinboo3> hes dropping it for awhile 
[12:04] <datoneguyweallknow> i'm not sure @skumbag_horse 

[12:04] <convertedclone> that being said, of course they reserved a lot of stock for Christmas, so there's no risk 
of a shortage, but that's more to ensure stock, not to create hype 
[12:04] <bootytease> online combo

[12:05] <noesnobody> ah the good ol lag switch 
[12:05] <convertedclone> Jebaited 

[12:05] <manyperegrine81> Is this game for current gen consoles? 

[12:05] <skumbag_horse> dropping means come back to it in a few days or probably not returning to it? 

[12:05] <iconicmasterl> Cheating in beta FailFish

[12:36] <ludwigh2018> cheer 100 Hey Phil, I think the "detractors" hate you because you seem to always talk 
about money. Past three years have been about you wanting money. Plus, the "detractors" keep on talking about 
broken promises like project 7 and other patreon goals that you went back on like quitting a patreon funded goal. 
I personally see no problem with you wanting money since other twitch users ask for money too. Keep on going

[12:55] <kekon3> after divekick 



[12:55] <jjbx22> this game is a waste of 60 dollars 
[12:55] <aintnosunshinemma> Is this a street fighter spin off

[12:56] <bethelewd> hey kate 

[12:57] <katexo234> happy egg nog Monday 

[12:57] <londorgael> I honestly dont get the appeal of fighting games 
[12:57] <londorgael> they seem like they have a high barrier of entry 
[12:57] <theycallmejimbob> it didn’t count BeTheLewd dspAngrydsp 
[12:57] <markymark52> its the competitive aspect londorgael 

[12:57] <bethelewd> jim also he had like 10 matches against one guy cause the guy was so salty he was losing :D 

[12:57] <me_god> fighting games are the ultimate lvsl challange 

[12:57] <jjbx22> not all fighting games do lol 
[12:57] <florglorp> londorgael that's the appeal 

[12:57] <dweebenheimer20> @londorgael a lot of it has to do with growing up with arcades 

[12:57] <theycallmejimbob> did he win all 10 BeTheLewd dspHmm 

[12:57] <jjbx22> injustice isnt hard to get into at all 

[12:57] <bethelewd> jim he won all i think 

[12:57] <dweebenheimer20> Injustass 

[12:57] <ccous666> play this but not tekken 7 :(i want to git yu good 
[12:57] <jjbx22> sfv is pretty easy to get into 
[12:57] <jjbx22> tekken 7 is hard lawl 

[12:58] <katexo234> @theycallmejimbob are you going to see Ocean's 8 ? 

[12:58] <dweebenheimer20> SFV is baby mode 

[12:58] <theycallmejimbob> you're gonna lose your bet today then BeTheLewd dspHmm 

[12:58] <bethelewd> phil title tthe 5rd vid STOP REMATCHING ME 

[12:58] <kekon3> you can only super after fierce moves muxylO 

[12:58] <bethelewd> :D 

[12:58] <sanyal627> KonCha 

[12:58] <atlastelamon9> What stick are you using? 

[12:58] <bethelewd> jim but phil isnt playing damn today 

[12:58] <kittyspank> great purchase 

[12:58] <bethelewd> he is playing kairi for now 

[12:58] <theycallmejimbob> I didn't even know there was an Ocean's 8 katexo234 NotLikeThis are you gonna 
watch it 



[12:58] <sleepsinthedark> you said the s word 

[12:58] <ccous666> @jjbx22 once yu know about whiff punish and combos yur good 

[12:58] <londorgael> But then it seems like if the game is catered towards new players, older players like Phil 
say that it's sad that they're not "how they used to be". Similar to gatekeeping. 

[12:58] <bethelewd> i watche both kingsman movies and i enjoyed em both 

[12:59] <leonaras> Someone donate a PS4 plus to phil for Christmas Kappa show that Christmas spirit 
[12:59] <jjbx22> @CCous666 lol no 

[12:59] <bethelewd> channing tatum was shit in the second movie 
[12:59] <nikiboo32_> Is dsp in practice mode? 

[12:59] <nikiboo32_> Holy shit 
[12:59] <bethelewd> yes practise 

[12:59] <katexo234> of course jimbob it's got Cate Blanchette and Sandra bullock in it with Rihanna in it as well 
[12:59] <ccous666> @jjbx22 dont like bragging n shit but ive been playing tekken for 8yrs, i know something 
dude 

[13:00] <markymark52> I have to say this music sucks though. Sounds like it was made in a MIDI program. 
[13:00] <jjbx22> but whiff punishing and combos isnt everything 
[13:00] <ccous666> i agree 

[13:00] <florglorp> londorgael sadly the high barrier of entry correlates with depth and depth is definitely the 
appealing part, older players have seen so many "easy to get into" games that lacked that depth they like about 
these games, that they tend to make that association right away 
[13:00] <leonaras> @markymark52 its classic EX music and its fantastic. 

[13:00] <bethelewd> do americans even know what kingsman is 
[13:00] <bethelewd> i dont even know it might be a british made thing 
[13:00] <theycallmejimbob> damn katexo234 good cast dspHmm 
[13:00] <kushiyakitori> Is it something aside from the movie? 

[13:00] <glorytobeh> its a bad movie 
[13:00] <atlastelamon9> Try mid screen 
[13:00] <markymark52> I disagree Leonaras ;) 

[13:01] <captcaveman4201> did he see my cheer about pubg yet ? my net crashed. 

[13:01] <katexo234> Kingman the secret service and the golden circle I've seen both bethe 
[13:01] <theycallmejimbob> don’t think so CaptCaveman4201 
[13:01] <romethedrone> obviously we know what kingsman is 
[13:01] <paddingtonbearl87> @captcaveman4201 no 

[13:01] <bethelewd> jim you want a good cast how about samuel jackson, gary oldman, channing tatum and 
halle berry 

[13:01] <bethelewd> thats only in 2 movies 
[13:02] <jjbx22> thats not real lol 

[13:02] <londorgael> @florglorp Yeah that makes sense. It's just a weird form of gatekeeping. Good input tho 
[13:02] <bethelewd> that isnt even all of em 

[13:02] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm what movie is that BeTheLewd 
[13:02] <theotherpoolboy> isnt there an option so phil can see his inputs? Kappa 
[13:02] <jjbx22> u whiffed the first punch @DarksydePhil 
[13:02] <bethelewd> jim the kingman movies 

[13:02] <katexo234> channing Tatum wasn’t in the first Kingsman bethe the fuck 

[13:02] <darthradovanviking> oh is he talking about a movie. I thought it was like some honor codex for english 
patriots or something 

[13:02] <kekon3> His cHP is a more consistent anti air punish anyway 

[13:02] <bethelewd> samuel jackson is the baad guy and he prohectile vomits at the sight of blood :D 
[13:02] <bos216 l>lmao 
[13:03] <obeychuy89> cahmbow 

[13:03] <florglorp> londorgael there are just so many options and ways to combine them, there is always some 
counter to everything else anyone does, it's just a matter of figuring it out. fighting games reward you a lot for 



spending time with them and thinking about it, imho like nothing else really (and not just through repetition). I 
guess that's why people like them 

[13:03] <bethelewd> hen we got some drug lord lady in the second one as the lady, reminds me of kate 
[13:03] <katexo234> PogChamp 

[13:03] <bionich00t> Hey Phil! Just found out I'm going to be a dad! it's twins! :D

[13:04] <hankhillpropanegod> tdogRat 
[13:05] <darthradovanviking> hello hank hills 

[13:05] <londorgael> @florglorp yeah reading some peoples comments i can see the competitive aspect being 
the main draw. It's like that for most multiplayer games in the sense of just being competitive and wanting to 
win. I've tried injustice and honestly I got through the story button mashing and using one combo. It seems very 
complicated as an outsider. 

[13:05] <kekon3> muxylO are you noticing that when you have g.break, your universal overhead becomes a 
unblockable? 

[13:05] <theycallmejimbob> edgae allan poe BeTheLewd ?

[13:05] <bethelewd> i know edgar is a writer right? 

[13:05] <bethelewd> i got that joke :D 

[13:05] <bionich00t> How would Phil feel if I named one of my kids Phil lol? 

[13:05] <theycallmejimbob> I never seen it BeTheLewd NotLikeThis

[13:06] <jjbx22> Gnemes 

[13:06] <londorgael> cheerlO what do you thi nk of the high barrier of entry for fighting games? 

[13:06] <wubegg> people are still mad about that LUL 

[13:06] <retrojim_> Why do the detractors keep getting away with it! TableHere FlipThis 
[13:06] <hankhillpropanegod> @theycalhnejimbob tdogRat 
[13:06] <brahski20> @retrojim_ With what? 

[13:07] <bionich00t> How is this game? 

[13:07] <jefoliveira902> Its not true. But i'm not sure what he means. 

[13:07] <katexo234> @BeTheLewd I know but if they make another family I would cast him as Gomez 

[13:07] <captcaveman4201> i knoe he dont own xboxl 

[13:07] <bethelewd> kate yeah 

[13:07] <bethelewd> who would be Wednesday 

[13:07] <florglorp> @londorgael yeah, singleplayer modes in fighting games super boring super often, why do 
you like to think about this stuff? just tried to get into it and didn’t see the appeal? or are you interested as a 
designer? 

[13:07] <leonaras> Shotos are the entry level chars 



[13:07] <bethelewd> lurch 
[13:07] <jjbx22> no they Arent 
[13:07] <bethelewd> uncle festus 
[13:08] <bethelewd> mortitia 

[13:08] <bethelewd> i think im fucking their names so bad 

[13:08] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil hates casual play in fighting games but loves it in everything else 

[13:08] <jjbx22> akuma in sfv isnt easy o-o and if u play blazblue izayoi isnt easy 

[13:08] <hankhillpropanegod> Piss on me tlexSly 

[13:08] <karlis_k> cheer500 a day late Okami cheer 

[13:08] <theotherpoolboy> does this game have good waifus? 

[13:08] <cookiemonster414> dont forget to wash yer hands Kappa 

[13:08] <leonaras> I always found shotos easier to grasp than charge chars or grapplers 

[13:08] <sanyal627> wow 

[13:08] <captcaveman4201> i say put the 30$ back to xblx rather than hold onto the crap version of the game 

[13:08] <katexo234> mortitia played by Eva green bethe 

[13:08] <jjbx22> not all shotos are easy 

[13:08] <sanyal627> @Karlis_K SeemsGood 

[13:08] <bethelewd> kate yaaaasss s 

[13:08] <londorgael> @florglorp i bought both injustices cause I'm pretty competitive and thought hey fuck it ill 
try fighting games. I got bodied so bad lmao, just gave up. Now im here just checking out what game phils 
playing now and get a bit turned off about fighting games. 

[13:08] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil had to wash some more "honey" off his hands Kappa 
[13:08] <bethelewd> i like her 

[13:08] <i_came_here_to_something> I don’t get why Phil never considers the fact the FGC is WAAAY more 
developed now vs. the 90s/early 2000s. Plus there's the internet. That's why tech gets around so quickly, not b/c 
the games have been simplified. 

[13:09] <sanyal627> SnowRip 

[13:09] <jjbx22> @londorgael why dont u practice 

[13:09] <jjbx22> to get better? 

[13:09] <elzorrobot> it's already comfirmed, I'm faster and more efficient at bathroom breaks than you Phil 
MrDestructoid 

[13:09] <i_came_here_to_something> If anything, fighting games are more complex than they were back in the 
day. 

[13:09] <bethelewd> kate we had a stage play of addams family here in uk it was good 
[13:09] <jjbx22>LOL 

[13:09] <katexo234> jimbob can play pugsly LUL LUL LUL 

[13:09] <i_came_here_to_something> Super Turbo's mad simple vs. any fighter coming out these days, even 
Smash Bros tbh 

[13:09] <jjbx22> all i see is memes 

[13:09] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock katexo234 

[13:10] <glorytobeh> That chick with the glowing eye looks cool 

[13:10] <kingofhypocrisy> @I_Came_Here_To_Something WRONG! Phil is the number 1 American in super 
turbo so he can't be wrong, nudnik Kappa 
[13:10] <bethelewd> jim as pugsly :D 

[13:10] <londorgael> @jjbx22 that's the obvious thing, but I sucked ass with using a controller and executing 
combos. Thought id rather just play something else. Fighting games aren't for me 
[13:10] <bethelewd> i will be thing 
[13:10] <bethelewd> :D 

[13:10] <lightkunl988> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Smash is a party game tho 
[13:10] <sanyal627> kazuya mishima rip off 

[13:10] <hankhillpropanegod> I hope the game doesn't lag and cheat to make Phil lose tdogTrigger 
[13:10] <jjbx22> @londorgael thats why u practice to get better 



[13:10] <darthradovanviking> dspHmm 
[13:10] <bethelewd> HERE COMES RAGE 
[13:10] <darthradovanviking> I hope so to hank 
[13:10] <bethelewd> and jimbob downfall 

[13:10] <markymark52> It's Monday, not going to find many matches. Many people are at work like me. 

[13:11] <theycallmejimbob> cahman BeTheLewd NotLikeThis 
[13:11] <wxrxaxtxh> play tekken 7 

[13:11] <dweebenheimer20> Street fighter 2 is the most simple game to pick up and play, yet one of the most 
complex at high level, thats the key 

[13:11] <bionich00t> Hey Phil I might name one of my kids to be born Phil by coincidence how about that 
@DarksydePhil 

[13:11] <dweebenheimer20> (SSF2T) 

[13:11] <londorgael> @jjbx22 like i said, I didn’t want to after being turned off. There wasn't a tutorial or 

anything to teach yourself. Not interested in watching a 30 min youtube video to understand lol 

[13:11] <bethelewd> jims downfall will be 

[13:11] <bionich00t> Maybe he’ll be on the dark side too 

[13:11] <bethelewd> GLORIOUS 

[13:11] <kekon3> ater a match is over it always takes you back too the menu, so I don’t recommend doing this 
[13:11] <jjbx22> @londorgael what youtube video go to trainingmode and learn your char 
[13:11] <kekon3> also, matchmaking is kinda slow in FEXL 
[13:11] <jjbx22> u cant learn a game in 5 minutes and expect to win lol? 

[13:12] <yoursaltygymsocks> Where the waifus at VoHiYo 
[13:12] <jjbx22> @londorgael and injustice has a tutorial o-o 
[13:12] <sanyal627> chicken dinner 

[13:13] <bionich00t> @DarksydePhil have you heard the rumor that internally Capcom has said they've dropped 
all support of Marvel Infinite? Internal memos say they don't plan any more DLC or balance patches 
[13:13] <londorgael> @jjbx22 are you daft? Like I said before, wasn't very good at using the controller to do the 
combos, and didn’t want to invest significant time to learn one character. Much rather just play something else. I 
pretty much button mashed through the injustice games to see their story at that point. 

[13:13] <bethelewd> so zayn and owens kept their jobs whilst dolph became new us champ and the usos, 

charlotte and aj styles retained thier belts 

[13:13] <jjbx22> lol how long did u play injustice 2 

[13:13] <jjbx22> @DarksydePhil and what do u mean learn 1 char injustice is easy 
[13:13] <wxrxaxtxh> @jjbx22 until he fought deadshot 

[13:13] <stuart360> Capcom are a joke these days, a shadow of what they once were 
[13:13] <katexo234> Charlotte TakeNRG 

[13:13] <kekon3> @DarksydePhil also I'll get on if it means you need a match 
[13:13] <jjbx22> u can literally play someone like super girl? the game isnt hard o-o 
[13:13] <kinggoken> dang marvel infinite flopped that much? 

[13:14] <dweebenheimer20> @stuart360 thats putting it lightly 
[13:14] <bethelewd> kate i wanted her to beat natayla 
[13:14] <kingofhypocrisy> That's Phil’s favorite game 
[13:14] <wubegg> poor Mvci :( 

[13:14] <kekon3> hey, that news isn't real 

[13:14] <bionich00t> One season of SFV DLC cost more than the development of Marvel Infinite apparently lol 
[13:14] <dannyhikari> @DarksydePhil i want to see you go back to street fighter v even tho you hate it:( 

[13:14] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[13:14] <kekon3> Infinite is still getting suppoort 

[13:14] <kinggoken> can't believe a mahvel game flopped 

[13:14] <drilbit777> New DB fighterz stream finally showed the dub PogChamp 

[13:14] <scruffshark> A sequel should be expected to be similar to the last game.

[13:20] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[13:20] <stuart360> Have you noticed how all lighting games these days are good to some level?. In the fighting 

hey day of the 90’s, there were so many that sucked, especially on N64 lol 

[13:20] <bethelewd> it was fair striaght down the middle 

[13:20] <katexo234> that's not fair 

[13:20] <bethelewd> dspNothing 

[13:21] <bethelewd> kate it was

[13:21] <katexo234> jimbob how you let Johnny bananas beat you? 

[13:21] <bethelewd> kate if you think it not fair you ref the rematch then 
[13:21] <stuart360> I quite liked Mace as well, reviews sucked for it though 
[13:21] <ez_eight> kinda like how FPS games do 
[13:21] <hankhillpropanegod> tdogSad 

[13:21] <thepastryarchy> @stuart360 I think a lot of that comes from the fact that fighting games are far more 
niche than other platforms, so if you're going to make a fighting game these days, you gotta get it far more right 
than most others. 

[13:21] <ez_eight> or platformers 

[13:21] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe I was ROBBED katexo234

[13:23] <bionich00t> It takes 2 seconds to follow 

[13:23] <thepastryarchy> Yeah, the worst fighting game we have these days is SF5, and even then, SF5 has 
quality to it 

[13:23] <kingofhypocrisy> dindu nuffin 

[13:23] <kinggoken> uh oh. Shouldn't mods ask before putting chat in followers only?

[13:23] <bethelewd> i thought it wasnt even in followers mode 
[13:24] <sanyal627> this is insane 

[13:24] <kushiyakitori> its been in followers for like 2 or 3 days I think 
[13:24] <bethelewd> jim you getting lucky 

[13:24] <bionich00t> Fighting genre is better off now than early-mid 2000s at least 

[13:24] <kctronislife> if ppl wanna troll phil they can follow kaceyHaha 

[13:24] <hankhillpropanegod> Make me mod Phil I will serve you justly tdogRat 

[13:24] <sickogrind> Vanilla mvci also kinda sucked but its getting better 

[13:24] <bionich00t> After Third Strike the genre died down a lot 

[13:24] <wxrxaxtxh> dood 

[13:24] <bionich00t> Came back a little after SF4 

[13:24] <bionich00t> It's not nearly as bad as early-mid 2000s 

[13:24] <katexo234> what's going on? 

[13:24] <dweebenheimer20> @Bionich00t more like after CvS2 
[13:24] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Glitched chat mechanics 
[13:24] <lukewalker41> hey Phil 
[13:24] <trihard41iife> TriHard 7 

[13:25] <darthradovanviking> ok i disable it for now then 

[13:25] <bethelewd> kate chat is in custon followers only mode and we mods dont know what is happening 
[13:25] <bionich00t> CvS2 was a low budget hashed together game. It also wasn't nearly as good as SVC Chaos 
imo anyway 

[13:25] <kekon3> it was pretty cool 
[13:25] <bowlofbran> freedom? 

[13:25] <elzorrobot> I prefer when Phil players with the big burly players like Zangief Kappa Pride 
[13:25] <stuart360> Yeah SF4 and MK9 kind of kickstarted the genre again, it was pretty much dead for a few 
years before that 
[13:25] <katexo234> oh ok 

[13:25] <kekon3> Phil, be aware matchmaking for this game is kinda slow 

[13:25] <dweebenheimer20> @Bionich00t maybe, but it was still pretty damn popular

[13:25] <bionich00t> @DarksydePhil Hey Phil, I've got twins on the way, found out today. Two boys.

[13:25] <dlmech> congratulations @Bionich00t 5Y‘D □ 

[13:26] <i_came_here_to_something> VF4 and Tekken 5 sold great actually 
[13:26] <me_god> in the west at least 

[13:26] <bionich00t> The best selling fighting games of that era were Namco ones like Tekken and SC. 

[13:26] <shlnn> Tekken was always selling great 

[13:26] <bionich00t> Capcom fighters sold like shit in that era. 

[13:26] <wxrxaxtxh> sitting in the menu yessss 
[13:26] <kekon3> Tekken was popular no matter what 



[13:26] <krost89> it's all just re used ex2 plus music lol 
[13:26] <thepastryarchy> Why is nobody playing Skullomania? :( 

[13:26] <xpj627x> sounds like a remix of skullomania's ex plus alpha theme 

[13:26] <elniceoguyo> holidaycheerlOO Any idea if the retail version is going to have a story mode? 

[13:26] <ger_r3de> :D 

[13:26] <drilbit777> @bionich00t 3rd strike was also on Dreamcast which didna€™t help 
[13:26] <stuart360> VF4 didnt sell well actually, if VF4 is the one that was on PS2. 

[13:26] <bethelewd> i love tekken 
[13:26] <bionich00t> It had a PS2 port too

[15:05] <ornightz> dweebenheimer20 Also Hokuto is possed by shirase , she has an awakening but no Psyhical 
changes just her flames , now she has a physical change in this Reboot 
[15:05] <kozatof> Did phil ever use to be a body builder

[15:16] <dreamcatalog> it's his alarm clock 
[15:17] <stratmanl909> i actually like it tho 

[15:17] <mrkarlsync> you think dsp has dreams where he wakes up ina cold sweat saying "I WAS BLOCKING 
THAT!" ? 

[15:17] <milly_o> YAHHH

holidaycheerl holidaycheerl holidaycheerl holidaycheerl holidaycheerl holidaycheerl holidaycheerl 
holidaycheerl holidaycheerl 

[15:21] <radicalenzyme> When is he playing PUBG? 

[15:21] <dweebenheimer20> @Rockstar0182 yeah there's teaser trailers of them 
[15:21] <dreamcatalog> later at 7 doodd 
[15:21] <rockstar0182> Blair Dame is hotter than Gammy 
[15:21] <radicalenzyme> k ty :) 

[15:22] <dreamcatalog> that's 7 pacific time afaik 
[15:22] <stratmanl909> cracker jack was cool 
[15:22] <dreamcatalog> special move - Uninstaller 

[15:23] <mrkarlsync> how far from release is this game? looks so unfinished. 

[15:23] <dweebenheimer20> @MrKarlSync "2018" 

[15:24] <stratmanl909> it was revealed a few months ago iirc 

[15:24] <mrkarlsync> iirc it was revealed on april 1st as a joke but it wasnt ajoke. 

[15:24] <stratmanl909> wont be surprised if it gets rushed for evo 

[15:24] <dweebenheimer20> Nah, this aint Capcom, they want to make a videogame, not e-sports 
[15:25] <stratmanl909> well that's good 

[15:25] <dreamcatalog> don’t you slander my basic cable celebrity tournaments!!! 

[15:26] <mrkarlsync> anyreason why dsp isnt coming back for season 3 of sf5? 

[15:26] <dreamcatalog> the mine collapsed 
[15:26] <kekon3> enough bad will 

[15:26] <mrkarlsync> the game has changed alot since aseason 1 
[15:27] <stratmanl909> i remember gettin sfv at launch 
[15:27] <stratmanl909> it was the bestest Kappa 
[15:27] <kekon3> I'm literally playing SFV rn 
[15:27] <kekon3> it hasn’t really 

[15:27] <mrkarlsync> sf5 is by no means perfect but out of all the popular fighting games out, its easily the best 
imo. 

[15:27] <assassinaltair7> Nothing I could do 
[15:28] <stratmanl909> tekken is pretty gud 

[15:28] <kekon3> unless Season3 radically changes things, I doubt phil will get into it 
[15:28] <stratmanl909> im more a tekken dood tho 

[15:28] <mrkarlsync> prefer combos to juggles, hate seeing characters float by being jabbed, silliness. 

[15:28] <skooma_dealer> i sleep 
[15:28] <skooma_dealer> i wake 
[15:28] <skooma_dealer> WOKE 

[15:28] <i_came_here_to_something> SFV's gotten a lot better since the early days; too bad Phil hasn’t given it 
second shake like it deserves imho 

[15:28] <kekon3> Phil, you want the uppercut super after stab 

[15:28] <mrkarlsync> @kekon3 I think I know why dsp wont come back to sf5. 

[15:28] <dreamcatalog> it hurt him. too deeply 

[15:29] <fondlemonster> I myself am a former pro fighting game player 
[15:29] <morphisiusz> unlimited health ? 

[15:29] <kushiyakitori> @Morphisiusz practice mode 
[15:29] <stratmanl909> pro at sf2 and marvel i think 
[15:29] <skooma_dealer> @Kekon3 you are so cute irl 
[15:29] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 
[15:29] <kekon3> Skooma pis 



[15:29] <stratmanl909> cant expect him to ace at tekken 
[15:29] <skooma_dealer> will be my other bf 

[15:29] <assassinaltair7> I myself am a former pro lighting game player 
[15:29] <kekon3> too many people tell me that 

[15:29] <fondlemonster> What cereal box did you get this shitass game out of 
[15:29] <skooma_dealer> ;) 

[15:29] <dreamcatalog> at least we have the turbo release in May 2018 

[15:30] <dreamcatalog> re release 

[15:30] <kekon3> I'm not cute jfc 

[15:30] <skooma_dealer> yes you are wth 

[15:30] <kekon3> >:( this is a bannable offense 

[15:30] <skooma_dealer> tfw he doesnt believe me :) 

[15:30] <skooma_dealer> :( 

[15:30] <mrkarlsync> im more interested in sf3 tbh. never played it when it released, looks like id enjoy it alot. 

[15:30] <kekon3> MrKarl, you'd like DOA a lot I think, DoA4 had some good ground combos 

[15:30] <dreamcatalog> can you two get each other's number 

[15:31] <skooma_dealer> he can have mine bb 

[15:31] <kekon3> also this game, not many long juggles 

[15:31] <mrkarlsync> think the last DOA I played was 2, to much titty bouncing tbh lol. moved onto soul calibre. 
[15:31] <dreamcatalog> 5Y~, 5Y~, 

[15:31] <kekon3> soul cal is p good, but that has a bit of juggling in it too 
[15:31] <stratmanl909> i member mkx :( 

[15:32] <mrkarlsync> been many moons since i played SC. look forward to what the newest installment brings. 
[15:32] <kekon3> same, it got me excited 
[15:32] <stratmanl909> fav sc? 

[15:32] <assassinaltair7> This game looks garbage 

[15:32] <i_came_here_to_something> @MrKarlSync 3S is overrated in some ways. SFV's a better fighter in 
several aspects, I think people's start realizing that more once Unreal removes the engine lag. 

[15:32] <dreamcatalog> star craft 
[15:32] <kekon3> 2 followed by 5 
[15:32] <stratmanl909> 2 is pretty great 

[15:33] <mrkarlsync> think mine was 4. the release after the one with spawn, heichi and yoda in the cross 
console release 

[15:33] <stratmanl909> i liked 4 

[15:33] <kekon3> SFV hasn't implemented the patch, hopefully that's in 

[15:33] <espada_92> which fightstick does dsp use 

[15:33] <kekon3> in Arcade Edition 

[15:33] <dreamcatalog> the MashBash3000 

[15:33] <fluffymoochicken> Garuda isn't very good I think 

[15:33] <kekon3> just played 3rd strike a day ago, still loots of fun 

[15:34] <kekon3> yeah, garuda is probably lowest character in beta 

[15:34] <i_came_here_to_something> They can't implement complete lag reduction Kekon b/c Epic isn’t doing 
that until like middle of next year and AE launches January. It'll eventually make it to Season 3 tho. People 
should know that the lag affects all Unreal 4 fighters, not just SFV 
[15:34] <spacejesustogroundcontrol> Million Dollar Extreme is the best anime! 

[15:34] <fluffymoochicken> Also other characters are super good 

[15:34] <skooma_dealer> i need to know why i cant get a gf 

[15:34] <fluffymoochicken> Allen is ridiculous 

[15:34] <skooma_dealer> Is it my raging gayness or autism 

[15:34] <stratmanl909> yes Kappa 

[15:35] <dreamcatalog> who is million dolar extremely 

[15:35] <kekon3> yeah, I've noticed @I_Came_Here_To_Something it was in Tekken 7 and I got annoyed at that 



[15:35] <dreamcatalog> you must mean DarkSyde Sam 

[15:35] <mrkarlsync> @Skooma_Dealer chicks sense desperation instantly, focus on yourself, improve yourself 
in mind body and spirit, and youll draw the one for you closer, lift weights, eat right, boom. 

[15:35] <kekon3> Hoping its not in SC6 or DBFZ 

[15:35] <skooma_dealer> @MrKarlSync I need to get buff on that brotien 

[15:35] <ornightz> cheer 10 #charity Garuda's Fire Special is charageable and can act as a defensive however it 
has one blind spot 

[15:36] <fluffymoochicken> Prepare for an uphill battle unless the other guy is bad 
[15:36] <assassinaltair7> I myself am a former pro fighting game player 

[15:36] <mrkarlsync> it will be a slow but steady process, stick with it and youll be fine, dont expect instant 
results. 

[15:36] <madibased> phils getting his ass, whooped 

[15:36] <skooma_dealer> yeah i need to cut out carbs 

[15:36] <sturbridges> Right in their hole 

[15:36] <skooma_dealer> i love carbs but its bad 4u 

[15:36] <dreamcatalog> Lol the voices sound recorded via phone 

[15:36] <spacejesustogroundcontrol> BWAKING THAT 

[15:36] <theycallmejimbob> lean meats and leafy greens Skooma 

[15:37] <i_came_here_to_something> I really don’t get all the love for 3S. It's a pretty good game, great even at 
times, but it really needed another balance patch and adjustments for game mechanics 
[15:38] <i_came_here_to_something> But I'll still get Anniversary for it so Kappa 

[15:38] <kekon3> Big changes SFV needs to make I don’t think they'll do is backdashing needs to be reworked, 
game needs a speed boost they needs to change a long list of hitboxes, throws need to throw opponents further, 
air to air exchanges need to not lead to ambiguous landings 

[15:38] <spacejesustogroundcontrol> When will you be a real man and p[lay Virtua Fighter 2? 

[15:38] <kekon3> a bunch of stuff, but it's p rooted in the design of SFV 

[15:38] <jjbx22> sfv doesnt need a speed boost 

[15:38] <jjbx22> and sfv fixed the thrw loops 

[15:39] <jjbx22> street fighter isnt animethe paceing is fine 

[15:39] <kekon3> I'm not talking about throw loops 

[15:39] <jjbx22> why would uwant the throws to throw further? 

[15:39] <assassinaltair7> I myself am a former pro fighting game player 

[15:39] <kekon3> some characters still get such advantage from throws that feel unneeded 

[15:39] <jjbx22> ofc they do 

[15:39] <kekon3> distance or lag is all it needs, by like 1-3 frames 

[15:39] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kekon3 I don’t think it needs a speed boost, it's pretty much same speed 
as 3S. Throws are good enough distance as-is otherwise they become too powerful. 

[15:39] <jjbx22> if i throw u its my adv 

[15:40] <assassinaltair7> No views 

[15:40] <skooma_dealer> is he saying powderpuff? 

[15:40] <i_came_here_to_something> But, they do need to adjust some of the Crush Counters, and jabs working 
so well as anti-airs (3S had the same problem just not as badly) 

[15:40] <kekon3> I feel like if I throw you, I should only get a damage pop and get no advantage 
[15:40] <jjbx22> nah 

[15:40] <fluffymoochicken> Ow ow ow ow ow 
[15:40] <jjbx22> i rather have the aadv than damage 
[15:40] <jjbx22> this isnt tekken 
[15:40] <dreamcatalog> lol 

[15:40] <fluffymoochicken> My PS4 is still having connection problems tongiht:( 

[15:40] <mrkarlsync> crouching jab or or standing jabs need to be done away with for AA in 5. 

[15:41] <jjbx22> ur lucky we cant combo off throws like other games can 

[15:41] <kekon3> I mean, for what I, as a player who wants to win wants, yeah I want throws with advantage 



[15:41] <kekon3> but as a dev I don't want that 

[15:41] <i_came_here_to_something> In 3S you literally had chars like Remy who could get juggles into Super 
from certain normal throws. People still love the game tho (Remy really needed that tho b/c he’s low-tier in 3S). 
[15:41] <skooma_dealer> i cant wait for the end of the month 
[15:41] <jjbx22> tiers are opinions @I_Came_Here_To_Something 

[15:41] <i_came_here_to_something> Or shotos like Ken that could throw Dudley and then lift him off the 
ground w/ a Super 

[15:41] <fluffymoochicken> SPINNING SUMO HEADBUTT 

[15:41] <nightbot> fluffymoochicken -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[15:42] <dreamcatalog> xd 

[15:42] <kekon3> Nightbot pis 

[15:42] <fhiffymoochicken> Et tu Nightbot 

[15:42] <ornightz> cheer 10 #charity Garuda always had short reach but makes up for by switching between 
offensnsives and defensives , his Fire Special can shred a good portion of HP when Held down and especially 
used in the corner 

[15:42] <skooma_dealer> @fluffymoochicken cute name bb 

[15:42] <kekon3> Remy was cool though, he went from low tier to mid high based on how good your tech was 
[15:42] <goldencolts> dont read cheer #charity cheer 15 
[15:42] <fhiffymoochicken> @Skooma_Dealer Thanks A _ A 
[15:42] <metarrixxxx> spamming headbutt for the win ! 

[15:42] <kekon3> did you understand charge partitioning? good, then do sick combos 
[15:42] <skooma_dealer> @fhrffymoochicken <3 
[15:42] <londorgael> rekt 

[15:42] <i_came_here_to_something> @jjbx22 It's mostly accepted Remy's low-tier in 3S. Him, Twelve, Sean, 
Hugo, and Q are usually in the low-tier. 

[15:42] <dreamcatalog> Fluoride is massively strong 

[15:42] <talionshadowl 138> dang, does Garuda have that low health? 

[15:43] <mrkarlsync> what teir does Alex belong to in 3s? 

[15:43] <mrmontyhshah> New video game who dis 
[15:43] <trihard41iife> dspPepe 
[15:43] <kekon3> Hes hard middle tier 
[15:43] <skooma_dealer> alien looks like he belongs in jojo 
[15:43] <stoneway> looks like blanka 

[15:43] <talionshadowl 138> @MrKarlSync I don’t really see him being high, B at most 

[15:43] <jjbx22> i dont go by tiers i just play who i like lol 

[15:43] <assassinaltair7> This is boring to watch 

[15:43] <skooma_dealer> garuda does look like blanka 

[15:43] <metarrixxxx> this game sucks ahahaha 

[15:43] <pinkdam> lol what a bugged game he falls through the spinning blades and takes no damage 
[15:43] <ronni_christensen> Hello Phil and chat! Merry Christmas from Denmark :D 
[15:43] <jjbx22> dbzf beta january 14th ffs 

[15:43] <mrkarlsync> love myself grapplers in fighting games.Enjoy playing Alex in sf5. looking forward to 
getting my hands on 3rd strike. 

[15:44] <fluffymoochicken> Lol that's low tier vs. top tier for ya 
[15:44] <dreamcatalog> xd 

[15:44] <skooma_dealer> @ronni_christensen hello! How is the weather there?! 

[15:44] <kekon3> Allen is designed after characters like Space Cobra 
[15:44] <stratmanl909> how come they have old smash at evo 
[15:44] <mlito22885> Garuda = Necalli and Blanka fuse 

[15:44] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kekon3 Lower mid-high tier, plus it depends on the opponent and their 
char. You really need to know his shit to stand a chance in a lot of match-ups. 

[15:44] <fluffymoochicken> Allen is an AMERICAN 



[15:44] <stratmanl909> where's tekken 3 Kappa 
[15:44] <dreamcatalog> in 1999 

[15:45] <kekon3> well, in the same way that Q and Hugo are considered not good, but good players will still win 
hard with them 

[15:45] <mlito22885> Allen is an annoying matchup for Garuda 

[15:45] <skooma_dealer> do you suppose twitter after they are purging red pilled motherfuckers 
[15:45] <skooma_dealer> support* 

[15:45] <skooma_dealer> boycott twitter 
[15:46] <madibased> lulz 

[15:46] <i_came_here_to_something> Yeah but that's the thing: everything else equal, certain chars have big 
disadvantages compared to others. It’s pretty noticeable w/ 3S. Parry only does but so much but yeah it comes 
down to the player. 

[15:46] <skooma_dealer> phil dont go on twitter they are gonna purge your account for being too red pilled 
[15:46] <mlito22885> Facebook is worse Kappa 

[15:46] <kekon3> It's why 3S became so popular even if 4th Strike is a better version of the game 

[15:47] <kekon3> regardless of the differences in characters the idea is no matter what you are still able to win a 

match regardless of situation 

[15:47] <dltrue_travis> man yoshimitsu looks weird 

[15:47] <i_came_here_to_something> xD I don't know if 4th Strike's a "better" version, I though it was more for 
shits n’ giggles 

[15:47] <mlito22885> Garuda with Juggernaut Gougi is much better 
[15:47] <skooma_dealer> Twitter purge 
[15:47] <skooma_dealer> Twitter is full on sjw 
[15:47] <londorgael> What second stream? PubG? 

[15:47] <kekon3> Yeah, we’re talking about design differences on each SF 
[15:48] <showll> Will you play 30th anniversary games when it comes out Phil? 

[15:48] <i_came_here_to_something> 3S got popular b/c of that Daigo/Wong EVO moment;) 

[15:48] <mlito22885> Meter and speed @darksydephil 
[15:48] <skooma_dealer> tfw 

[15:48] <trihard41iife> I should get into tekken dspHmm 
[15:48] <skooma_dealer> i like tekken 
[15:48] <bobacon_tachibana> clintGZM clintS 

[15:48] <mlito22885> with miracle you have speed but u still get the Armor in Juggernaught 
[15:48] <skooma_dealer> dont point that at me 

[15:48] <kekon3> @I_Came_Here_To_Something yeah p much, the same thing could have happened to Garou 
or KOF2002 

[15:49] <skooma_dealer> unless youre gonna end my sifering pull the trigger

[15:50] <londorgael> ok then 

[15:50] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kekon3 Yeah. They had the NEC over the weekend. Was nice to see 
Chris G using Yang. I think he won it. 

[15:50] <kekon3> yeah, I cant say Super Turbo is pretty but hell if its not amazing to play 
[15:50] <skooma_dealer> chun li is the hottest 
[15:50] <skooma_dealer> hands down 
[15:50] <mlito22885> @Ornightz indeed 

[15:51] <kekon3> Mostly got reminded of how good the footsies in SF3 Felt, that playing SFV right now makes 
me miss it more 

[15:51] <skooma_dealer> LEL xbox one x is 187 bucks on ebay right now 
[15:51] <skooma_dealer> with battlefeild 1 

[15:51] <mrkarlsync> SF2T was my first fighting game, goodtimes. 

[15:51] <kekon3> thats why I want the "Speed boost" and "long list of changed hitboxes" 

[15:51] <dreamcatalog> sounds legit 
[15:51] <skooma_dealer> ikr 
[15:51] <pinkdam> sounds like a steal 

[15:51] <bobacon_tachibana> SnowYeti SnowYeti SnowYeti 
[15:51] <skooma_dealer> sounds like steal yo money 

[15:51] <kekon3> if more moves were designed like SFV Urien's sHP then I wouldn’t bitch 

[15:51] <assassinaltair7> Cana€™t trust eBay 

[15:52] <dreamcatalog> it's an Xbox one with an x drawn on the top 

[15:52] <skooma_dealer> i love amaon i used to fuck with ebay but not anymore 

[15:52] <rosshardie> @kekon3 yeah, anti airing in SFV hardly takes any real reactions unfortunately 

[15:52] <karlis_k> cheer200 Go go gadget #charity ! 

[15:53] <skooma_dealer> i love amazon prime 

[15:53] <madibased> i myself, am a former fighting game pro 

[15:53] <kekon3> that too, proper anti airs with normals need to be a big deal 

[15:53] <skooma_dealer> you know they have a drone that delivers in my area 

[15:53] <i_came_here_to_something> Urien’s s.HP suits him, but I don't think that’d work for a lot of other 
chars, simply b/c their limbs are shorter. TBH Urien’s long ass limbs have always annoyed me 
[15:53] <skooma_dealer> i got a cook delivered by the drone 
[15:53] <skooma_dealer> book* 

[15:53] <assassinaltair7> I myself am a former pro fighting game player 

[15:53] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[15:53] <madibased> prob his best quote 

[15:53] <kekon3> I mostly bring up Urien sHP because then I think about Vega's cMP 

[15:53] <rosshardie> This game isnt as polished yet as SFV, and has a lot of cheap/broken stuff but at least you 
have to anti air properly. It actually takes skill and good reads. 

[15:53] <skooma_dealer> tfw nobody likes me 
[15:53] <skooma_dealer> imina sit in the cuck shed 
[15:54] <stratmanl909> Kappa 

[15:54] <rosshardie> And the footsies are a lot better in this game too 
[15:54] <kekon3> those two moves against each other is a sad story 



[15:54] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride 

[15:54] <i_came_here_to_something> Well in both SFV and SF3 you can do standing jabs for anti-air :/ 

[15:54] <mlito22885> cheer 10 One very damaging combo lp mp hp qcf hp cancel to Qcf qcf p cancel into qcb 
qcb p try it in training we all know netplay has delays 

[15:54] <mrkarlsync> if the floaty combat stays ill be giving this game a miss, just not my style. 

[15:54] <kekon3> In SF3 AA jabs throw opponents away 
[15:54] <skooma_dealer> power poof 

[15:54] <i_came_here_to_something> The difference btwn them is it's easier to move in and mix up off a jab 
anti-air in SFV vs 3S 

[15:54] <kekon3> the reason AA jabs was a problem was the opponent landed in front of you 
[15:54] <kekon3> yeah 

[15:54] <assassinaltair7> This game looks awful 
[15:54] <skooma_dealer> pssst this game is not interesting 

[15:55] <rosshardie> @i_came_here_to_something anti air jabs are in most games, the difference is, they 

arena€™t guaranteed anywhere near as much and dont lead to 50/50s like SFV 

[15:55] <kekon3> @Skooma_Dealer pis 

[15:55] <assassinaltair7> Change to pubg 

[15:55] <mlito22885> Rip AA jab in SfVAE supposively 

[15:55] <skooma_dealer> FailFish im bored 

[15:55] <somethingyer2> is dsp going to play SFV AE? 

[15:55] <pinkdam> phil's controller must be haunted 

[15:55] <skooma_dealer> @Kekon3 dont make me kiss you on the mouth 

[15:55] <kekon3> I've still got my copy of SFV so I'll be waiting. All my friends are gonna try it so I'm trying it 
too 

[15:55] <rosshardie> I dont think AA jabs are leaving SFV but the throw loops are going though supposedly 

[15:55] <kekon3> @Skooma_Dealer pis, I belong to anonybro 

[15:56] <skooma_dealer> so do i fam 

[15:56] <jjbx22> the throw loops are gone 

[15:56] <skooma_dealer> he got me this crown 

[15:56] <i_came_here_to_something> @RossHardie I know; that's what I was eventually getting at. I just find it 
funny sometimes w/ people complain about anti-air jabs in SFV as a whole but then don’t seem aware that they 
exist in 3 S as well. You know, random people saying stuff like that and whatnot. 

[15:56] <skooma_dealer> its one big orgy in here 

[15:56] <i_came_here_to_something> Throw loops gone is gonna fuck w/ Ken's game a lot 
[15:56] <stratmanl909> BigBrother 

[15:56] <uchihamadaral080> cheerlO How come you never played strider in mvc origins he is my favourite 
character in mvc 1 

[15:56] <mrkarlsync> @Somethingyer2 either no outright or will be a patreon goal, im leaning more towards no 
because of the replays recording inputs, he says he blocks but was repeatidly downback light kicking on wakeup.

[15:57] <kekon3> I don't think SFV likes Ken 

[15:57] <rosshardie> @i_came_here_to_something yeah. I just hate the AA jabs in SFV because it takes away 
from the reactionary gameplay that made SF great and fun. Anyone can do them without even having to think 
[15:57] <somethingyer2> dood im blacking 

[15:57] <mlito22885> One I can say about this game its def not gunna be for everyone. Its more difficult then it 
looks 

[15:57] <jjbx22> ken and ryu should not be top tier tbh 
[15:58] <somethingyer2> fiiire BAAWUALLE 



[15:58] <kekon3> if SFV was on the speed of this game but still played like SFV i’d probably have never 
dropped it 

[15:58] <kingwhiterabbit> Hey Phil, are you feeling good today? 

[15:58] <rosshardie> Some even trade on crossups, like Necallis what the hell is that nonsense 5Y~, 

[15:58] <somethingyer2> sfv is boring as fuck 

[15:58] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kekon3 Must feelsbadman . At least you aren’t in Juri territory. 
@RossHardie Agreed, tho I guess like everything else maybe they can exist as long as it doesn't dominate the 
meta unfairly. 

[15:58] <somethingyer2> too slow 

[15:58] <jjbx22> @Kekon3 thats to fast 

[15:58] <stratmanl909> tier lists change all the time 

[15:58] <jjbx22> >game based on neutral and footies complains about it being to slow 
[15:58] <skooma_dealer> is there a mod for these chars to be naked? 

[15:58] <somethingyer2> SFIV was faster than V. 

[15:58] <jjbx22> @StratManl909 why do u care about tier list should play who you like o-o 
[15:58] <kekon3> It's not that fast, I've played FEXL, it's mostly fast because chains are universal 
[15:58] <kekon3> and theres running instead of dashing 
[15:58] <pinkdam> aww no more rematch 

[15:59] <skooma_dealer> quick question for chat: if you were at a bar and a gay guy wanted to buy you a drink, 
would you accept it? 

[15:59] <mlito22885> the supers input @darksydephil 

[15:59] <wxrxaxtxh> NO 

[15:59] <kekon3> @Skooma_Dealer ye 

[15:59] <kingwhiterabbit> Comeon Phil kick his ass! 

[15:59] <niatana> ye 

[15:59] <skooma_dealer> But what if he thought you were down for segs 

[15:59] <i_came_here_to_something> SFIV felt faster than 3S tbh. I think SFV as-is is pretty close to regular 3S 
speed. 

[15:59] <kekon3> I've done it in fact 

[15:59] <skooma_dealer> what if he spiked it with GHB 

[15:59] <skooma_dealer> :0 

[15:59] <wxrxaxtxh> id give him jimbobs number 

[15:59] <mlito22885> Garuda wins this match up imo 

[15:59] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[15:59] <i_came_here_to_something> Might be a thing of the 3D visuals making people think SFV's slower than 
it really is, maybe? 

[15:59] <stratmanl909> @jjbx22 i do use who i like 
[15:59] <somethingyer2> yeah SFV looks pretty ugly too 
[15:59] <skooma_dealer> @Kekon3 what happened? 

[15:59] <theycallmejimbob> cahman WxRxAxTxH NotLikeThis 
[15:59] <jjbx22> then why care about the tier list lol

[16:00] <i_came_here_to_something> @Somethingyer2 Nah man; game looks great. Got the best animations for 
a fighter out there atm too. And the girls are thicc :) 

[16:00] <skooma_dealer> @Kekon3 awww that sucks convo is everything 
[16:00] <kekon3> nerdy boys are bad boyfriends as it turns out 
[16:00] <stratmanl909> @jjbx22 i just meant that most lists are bs 
[16:00] <somethingyer2> i really dislike how it looks imo 



[16:00] <wxrxaxtxh> ahahahaha 

[16:00] <skooma_dealer> awww that sucks, i dont like a person who cant add anything to a convo 

[16:01] <skooma_dealer> esp when they have no opinion 

[16:01] <kingwhiterabbit> cheer 10 come on Phil kick his ass 

[16:01] <kekon3> the look of this game reminds me of Killer instinct actually

[16:01] <crushbrain> hey @cnu_deireoil 

[16:01] <uchihamadaral080> I think @DarksydePhil is right by time they started developing sfV all the talent 
was already gone so we got a shit game 
[16:01] <wxrxaxtxh> isnt annonycoon gay too? 

[16:01] <kekon3> You know what the real shit is tho? 

[16:02] <reporterincheif> are they speaking wapanese 

[16:02] <kekon3> ono has always said SFV was going to coome out in 2018 until Sony stepped in and rushed 
development along 

[16:02] <mlito22885> Every special Skullomania does is punishable on block 
[16:02] <skooma_dealer> Arent we all a bit gay 

[16:02] <i_came_here_to_something> To each their own @Somethingyer2.1 quite like SFV's art style. 
Especially now that they fixed most of the clipping problems. 

[16:02] <skooma_dealer> Im a female but you dont believe me 

[16:02] <skooma_dealer> KappaPride

[16:03] <i_came_here_to_something> So really Sony should get the blame for the game's early problems, not

[16:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @reporterincheif Just give it more time. They're a small dev team and 
they just started dev only a few months ago. This isn't mean to be a super-serious fighter tho. Play EX, EX2 and 
Fighting Layer and maybe you’ll understand what it's aiming for.

[16:13] <atomicgekko> du du duria 
[16:13] <sekander> that kick is pretty cool 

[16:13] <kekon3> so I just read an article that says "we named it SFV arcade edition because we added arcade 
mode, SFV isn’t getting an arcade release" 

[16:13] <kekon3> like bruh wat? 

[16:13] <fluffymoochicken> Nice work 

[16:13] <sekander> reminds me of Mortal Kombat 1, forget which character 
[16:13] <sekander> the bicycle kick 

[16:13] <lunar_rabs> phil did it say ur connection status was one?

[16:14] <sekander> ah ok right 

[16:14] <i_came_here_to_something> @Talionshadowl 138 It's situational and doesn’t happen too often, but 
sometimes you can get stuff like Ken's target combo into EX Shoryu not doing all hits on certain opponents (last 
hits of EX will miss so they can punish). But it seems to only happen off of doing target combo as a counter to 
certain attacks on certain opponents. Not all that often.

[17:03] <i_came_here_to_something> cheer20 We may disagree strongly on SFV but it's neat to see you're 

giving this game's beta a chance 

[17:03] <butter_my_bread> naturally be he's rallying 

[17:04] <hobbsl017> and floe has a new apartment in vegas and he doesnt stream play throughs or make his 

own vids etc his parents pay for it all.even for his golddiggers GF's BMW before she dumped his ass lol
