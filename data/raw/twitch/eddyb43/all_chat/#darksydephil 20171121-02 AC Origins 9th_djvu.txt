[19:50] <concretecasket> active chatters 

[19:50] <lestertheunlikelyl3> I just finished watching dsp Skyrim series including die. I know Ia€™m 6 years 
late but that was very entertaining. 300+ parts was insanely fun to experience. Since I personally never played it 
Ia€™m gonna buy it on Xbox one and enjoy every minute. 

[19:51] <concretecasket> A 

[19:51] <neospartanhesperos9> Need for... -takes deep breathe to lazily finish sentence- ..speed... 
ResidentSleeper 

[19:51] <thatanonybear> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 it's very fun on Xbone, even better with mods on PC :D 



[19:51] <plizzat5> CarlSmile 
[19:51] <thatanonybear> UPDATE 

[19:52] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @thatanonybear whata€™s up bear I heard there were mods on Xbox as well? 

[19:52] <thatanonybear> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 there's mods on Xbox but not all the same mods. A lot of mods 

are exclusive to PC, but Xbox has more than PS4 

[19:52] <superbatcat> about fucking time 

[19:52] <jannedaarcl35> Don't let them do it. Phil! 

[19:53] <jannedaarcl35> Save us >.< 

[19:53] <bentboxer> too bad charlie rose isnt around to talk about net neutrality 
[19:53] <bentboxer> sigh 

[19:53] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Oh okay well Ia€™m gonna try them out when I get the game 
[19:53] <breath321> Not being american never felt so good, looks like there's a lot of people in America that are 
against net neutrality or straight up don’t know what iti s 
[19:53] <chairmancaleb> Lmao, so stupid., 

[19:53] <thatanonybear> Praise Hawaii-'! 

[19:53] <concretecasket> dspShock dspShock 
[19:53] <thatanonybear> Fully support this 
[19:53] <wholetruthbruce> Lol 

[19:53] <kingofhypocrisy> Belgium is a fake country dood 

[19:54] <breath321> Lootboxes are fine in f2p stuff imo, they need a way to monetize their stuff 
[19:54] <concretecasket> no one cares about mobile games 
[19:54] <eazybayke> no my gacha games ! PunOko 

[19:54] <breath321> There are better ways, of course, but I'm not 100% against it 
[19:54] <neospartanhesperos9> shut up, KingOfHypocrisy cmonBruh 
[19:54] <wholetruthbruce> #ThanksTrump 
[19:54] <plizzat5> shesh 

[19:54] <elipsion> Im perfectly fine with no more mobile games 

[19:54] <chairmancaleb> @Breath321 It's either all okay or none of it is okay. 

[19:55] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Lol that means shadow of war, over watch,and every single ea game will be 
banned 

[19:55] <bentboxer> trump is getting rid of the dirty Scandinavians... send them back... love trump 
[19:55] <wholetruthbruce> Hilarious gameplay doe 

[19:55] <chairmancaleb> If thei issue people have with it is "gambling", then you can't pick and choose which 
video games are okay. 

[19:55] <concretecasket> and I'm sure they could can still do microtransactions just not randomized ones 
[19:55] <pray4rock> Thata€™s a good thing., game companies wouldna€™t wanna do 21+ games for exclusive 
regions of the world. And it wouldna€™t be allowed on the 3 major console manufacturer. 

[19:55] <breath321> @ChairmanCaleb Yeah, I don’t care at all about the lootbox aspect of it, I'm more 
concerned about it being p2w stuff in 60 dollar games 

[19:55] <thatanonybear> ban all games that put gambling in the hands of children 

[19:55] <thatanonybear> simple as that 

[19:55] <cinochino> Monster hunter beta 9 dec, gonna play it? 

[19:56] <plizzat5> I need a hoodie 

[19:56] <breath321> @ChairmanCaleb Whenever people complain about children gambling, they forget that 
kids should probably not be playing shooter games in the first place 

[19:56] <elipsion> @DarksydePhil With being able to get clips from twitch in realtime getting the funniest 
moments will be easy, maybe something to think about in 2018? 

[19:56] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Ban ea period 

[19:56] <thatanonybear> @Breath321 Nonsense, kids need to know how to kill prostitutes in GTA 

[19:56] <kingofhypocrisy> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 what is a belgian dood? a bunch of french and dutch people 

in a fake country 

[19:57] <chairmancaleb> @Breath321 They should also Ban Nintendo for providing Pokemon card packets as 



well while they're at it then, lol. The "It's affecting the children!" sentiment is all a bunch of bullshit to push their 
agenda. 

[19:57] <kingofhypocrisy> Do it dood 

[19:57] <lestertheunlikelyl3> This is my first thanksgiving in America lol 

[19:57] <bentboxer> the detective in murder of the orient express is belgian and he is probably the greatest 
detective in the world 
[19:57] <cinochino> Uh oh 

[19:57] <breath321> @ChairmanCaleb Yeah, I've played MTG for like 6 years, if the card packs were seen as 

gambling then it wouldn't even exist at all 

[19:57] <kingofhypocrisy> Gotta give the people what they want 

[19:57] <neospartanhesperos9> @KingOfHypocrisy why is Belgium a fake country 

[19:57] <chairmancaleb> @Breath321 Exactly.

[20:07] <bammbino> @SirNobleX take2 stated they will never make/publish another game that does NOT have 

microtransactions., it was a promise to their share holders for even more gains 

[20:07] <bentboxer> @pray4rock even if you bet like a hundred bucks you'll be 3 times richer 

[20:07] <kingofhypocrisy> bugged audio 

[20:07] <ningen_sama> cloud 2 were on sale for $75 

[20:07] <sirnoblex> @concretecasket Yes, it was great. Bought an Xbox 360 for that game

[20:08] <concretecasket> @SirNobleX one of the all time favorites, at one point I was 8th in the world at free for 
all online 

[20:08] <cinochino> Smash ur headphones 
[20:08] <kingofhypocrisy> bitch slap the ps4 

[20:09] <breath321> Assassin's creed origins really benefit from taking an extra year in development 
[20:09] <reallybuffllama> a40 TR's are awesome, Phil 

[20:09] <sirnoblex> @Bammbino Maybe, but just because it has micro transactions doesn't make it a bad game. 

It can be implemented in many different ways. Obviously EA's implementation was a bad way of doing it. 

[20:09] <breath321> they should do the same for other yearly game releases that've been getting stale like COD 
[20:09] <thatanonybear> @SirNobleX What's a good implementation of microtransactions? 

[20:09] <bammbino> @SirNobleX true, time will tell! i did say it could, not will be bad 
[20:09] <jannedaarcl35> lol 

[20:10] <bammbino> @SirNobleX im sure the story will be decent even tho its a pre-quial 
[20:10] <retroos> assassins creed in 2017 LUL 
[20:10] <bentboxer> kill them phil... kill them all! 

[20:10] <baylesstheg0> DOOD 

[20:10] <breath321> @ThatAnonyBear Cosmetic only isn't that bad, Warframe's monetization system is 
probably the best out of all F2P games out there right now 

[20:10] <sirnoblex> @ThatAnonyBear A in game skin such as how CSGO does it. 

[20:10] <neospartanhesperos9> I sense the presence of a great force among us. He is a Junkrat master BigBrother

[20:17] <thatanonybear> @Breath321 yeah, not a fan of the game but dsp has improved it immensely 

[20:17] <neospartanhesperos9> i was viewing another guy who had less commentary and it was still fun. I guess

[20:20] <chairmancaleb> Like I said, this looks like a mindless, but fun open world game you can just enjoy 
yourself in. A fun sand box of sorts. I just miss the narrative we used to have that tied Desmond's story together 
back in the good old days. 

[20:21] <breath321> Yeah the RPG style loot with different attributes is fun and all, but it doesn't feel like an 
Assassin’s Creed game

[20:43] <breath321> @Bammbino Yeah I didn’t play it, or watch many people play it either so idk how good it is 
[20:44] <bammbino> i think im okay w/ yearly or bi-yearly AC but they need 4 years so 4 studios., they have 3 i

[20:51] <djrunol> oh yeah, caesar was always jelly of alexander. i forgot 

[20:51] <breath321> Not being american never felt so good, with all the net neutrality stuff 

[20:51] <paddingtonbearl87> the most stressful thing about trump is whether or not his hair is real OSsloth 

[20:51] <mksushi> What is net neutrality 

[20:51] <stinkinburrows> @Breath321 Thats just one of the many problems we got goin on 

[20:51] <breath321> @Stinkinburrows Yeah, weird how America used to be an example of how to do things 

right, now it's the opposite 

[20:51] <lestertheunlikely 13> Your president spends to much on Twitter. 

[20:52] <paddingtonbearl87> animals 

[20:52] <chairmancaleb> Twitter takes like 20 seconds to send out a tweet. 

[20:52] <plizzat5> goats 

[20:52] <stinkinburrows> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 thats good, it distracts him from doing even more harm 
[20:52] <super_slade> men, women, sassy donkeys 

[20:52] <jelseal973> Phil bring up your map are you still on the world map? 

[20:52] <mksushi> Well ita€™s 2017, if the head of the country wants to get his word out as fast as possible 

then Twitter is a good route 

[20:52] <chairmancaleb> A 

[20:52] <mksushi> Not defending him jo 

[20:52] <djrunol> did he have sex with pans too? 



[20:52] <chairmancaleb> Not sure why people have problems w/ that. 

[20:52] <conky89> Net neutrality is basically where the internet is not under the control of institutions with an 
agenda 

[20:53] <sirnoblex> @jelseal973 There isn’t a map, but is in an area on the map 
[20:53] <djrunol> pansexuals have sex with pans 

[20:53] <mksushi> @chairmancaleb ita€™s like people want him to send out letters or hold a gathering 

whenever he needs to say something 

[20:53] <paddingtonbearl87> he once fucked a pie 

[20:53] <thatanonybear> I just wished the POTUS put more than 20 seconds of thought into any statement 

[20:53] <stinkinburrows> gigantism, not giantism 

[20:53] <chairmancaleb> @Mksushi Old fashioned people. 

[20:53] <thatanonybear> I wish he’d pass legislation too 
[20:54] <mksushi> @thatanonybear agreed 

[20:54] <chairmancaleb> @ThatAnonyBear Oh, he does if you paid more attention to the press gatherings he's 
held many times throughout the year. Those are for the more important matters. 

[20:54] <breath321> If Trump gets re-elected I'll legit be in shock 

[20:54] <chairmancaleb> Sending out tweets are just quick notices to the people. 

[20:55] <mksushi> @chairmancaleb yea you got a point 
[20:55] <sirnoblex> What's that chain thing? 

[20:55] <sirnoblex> lol 

[20:55] <stinkinburrows> what up with that chain bro? 

[20:55] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @thatanonybear no problem you were my first friend on here 

[20:55] <breath321> Ubisoft glitches

and no rhetoric or competence. 

[20:56] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @thatanonybear just let me and you go okay. Ita€™ll be fun really hot 
[20:56] <conky89> The thing with large, openworld games with lots of content like the Bethesda games is that 
glitches will be inevitable 

[20:57] <chairmancaleb> @Conky89 Don’t forget the stale factor. 

[20:57] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 what 
[20:57] <conky89> Well that's why mods exist 
[20:57] <djrunol> he ded 

[20:57] <breath321> @Conky89 Lots of content is not that accurate, Skyrim and Fallout 4 were mediocre at best

[20:57] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 ahh :P 



[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> i read it late, was doing something

[21:03] <breath321> like the whole reason anthem exists probably, is because EA wants to compete with 

Activision's Destiny 

[21:04] <breath321> it'll probably fail 

[21:04] <paddingtonbearl87> TPFufun bruh 

[21:04] <breath321> even though destiny 2 is pretty bad itself 

[21:04] <djrunol> so they were able to climb every damn rock in this entire game but cannot scale this building 
[21:04] <popsicolo> It was a glitch in the animus 
[21:04] <thekter> lol 

[21:04] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Wherea€™s Desmond ? 

[21:05] <popsicolo> Dead. 

[21:05] <super_slade> Where's Jade Raymond? 

[21:05] <popsicolo> Dead. 

[21:05] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Oh wow thata€™s unfortunate 
[21:05] <paddingtonbearl87> WRONG TPFufun 
[21:05] <conky89> Because Ubisoft saw a money printer with this series 
[21:05] <popsicolo> Okay maybe Jade's not dead. popsicSmug 

[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> rocks have edges and protusions to grip to , building's have completely vertical 

walls with flat surfaces that's impossible to climb CoolStoryBOb

[21:39] <bammbino> he was to follow her til they got near the outside of the tomb 
[21:39] <bammbino> not the whole way 

[21:39] <bammbino> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 thats like getting the cat and not feeding it! 

[21:39] <breath321> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 It's more on the games part, why would it be designed so you can 
just skip groups of enemies 
[21:39] <bethefueg> This speed run is amazing 
[21:40] <bethefueg> Whata€™s immersion? 

[21:40] <breath321> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 What's the point of having them be there if they're entirely 
avoidable

channel 

[21:40] <eldeadmariachi> FabolousFlavius 

[21:40] <bammbino> @Breath321 the very first thing they said before showing content for the game is that they 

want us to choose how we play for once 

[21:40] <neospartanhesperos9> Pacifist run is in games LUL 

[21:40] <bethefueg> This is on easy? 

[21:40] <bammbino> @Breath321 wanna run? run., wanna brawl? brawl etc 

[21:40] <breath321> @Daymanfighter Yeah that too @Bammbino I guess it would make sense if there was 
stealth involved, but he literally just ran past them 
[21:40] <bethefueg> AC series has difficulty levels? 

[21:41] <bammbino> hes on normal, but you need to play on hard for atleast SOME challenge in SOME parts 
[21:41] <bammbino> alot of us are asking for NG+ and legendary difficulty 
[21:41] <ass_blastor> DSP, you're a little toooo good doing the gay lisp thing 
[21:41] <thatanonybear> @Ass_Blastor pis 

[21:41] <breath321> They should just do like Diablo does it, and add like 15 levels of difficulty that gradually 
increase loot and experience gains, the higher difficulty you go 
[21:41] <plizzat5> Haha he's had a lot of practice 
[21:41] <bammbino> @Ass_Blastor see what you did!!!

[21:43] <deadshotl30> So Phil hates this game huh Jebaited 
[21:43] <thesupervillain543> this is homosexist 

[21:43] <daymanfighter> Must be his thing play like a pre school kid and wreak the game he plays 

[21:43] <stinkinburrows> brute LUL 

[21:43] <thatanonybear> THE THIZE OF THITH BRUTE 

[21:43] <guy_incognito_> StoneLightning 

[21:44] <bethefueg> Phil does give the vibe that hea€™s gotten bored of this game 
[21:44] <thesupervillain543> Prey was playthrough of the year 
[21:44] <daymanfighter> cohhGV 

[21:44] <bammbino> @BeTheFueg it started with alexander being pansexual lol 
[21:44] <thesupervillain543> either Prey or RE7 

[21:44] <deadshotl30> That's all AC games though, they get boring fast 
[21:44] <thesupervillain543> I love when phil stays engaged 

[21:44] <breath321> yeah whenever I get bored of a game I start skipping enemies and rushing part everything 



[21:44] <deadshotl30> I heard Prey sucked ass, was Phils playthrough good? 

[21:44] <guy_incognito_> ancient aliens? 

[21:44] <plizzat5> @deadshotl30 true dat 
[21:44] <breath321> past even 

[21:45] <thesupervillain543> @deadshotl30 he loved it 

[21:45] <bethefueg> But @bammbino makes it still worthwhile 

[21:45] <bammbino> i thought he was a bad guy 

[21:45] <bammbino> he had the "Evil/back sttabbing" smirk in the start 

[21:45] <neospartanhesperos9> Chutulu is coming WutFace 

[21:45] <thatanonybear> @deadshotl30 i heard good things about Prey 

[21:45] <plizzat5> bring back mario

[21:45] <nightbot> Daymanfighter -> DEUS VUET [warning] 

[21:45] <deadshotl30> @ThatAnonyBear Ill probably catch it on sale 
[21:45] <stinkinburrows> how is his head staying up? 

[21:45] <thesupervillain543> @deadshotl30 prey is top 5 this year imo 
[21:45] <breath321> @Stinkinburrows The power of friendship 

[21:45] <madibased> I bought prey and wolfenstein both full price and was disappointed 
[21:46] <bammbino> potential bug: music gets abnormally loud after this 
[21:46] <thatanonybear> @deadshotl30 it's beengoing on sale a lot lol but it still looks real good 
[21:46] <madibased> Both good games but like I had no desire to finish them :/ 

[21:46] <neospartanhesperos9> @Bammbino dspGlitch 

[21:46] <deadshotl30> Wolfenstein 2 was a damn joke, I haven’t finished it yet but spoiled the ending 

[21:46] <breath321> @madibased if they don't even keep you engaged enough to finish, did you really like them? 

[21:46] <breath321> I think Prey was very good imo 

[21:46] <madibased> @deadshotl30 no final boss is a terrible way to end a wolfenstein game 
[21:46] <thesupervillain543> did phil finish wolfenstein 

[21:47] <carlitosmartell> I dont understand how people can spend the whole day playing games and still be bad 
at them 

[21:47] <thatanonybear> @thesupervillain543 Yes 
[21:47] <deadshotl30> Maybe the final boss will be DEC Jebaited 
[21:47] <breath321> @carlitosmartell same 
[21:47] <bethefueg> Out of the vault 

[21:47] <bammbino> is it cause they're short? i have no interest in that wolfenstein game 

[21:47] <bethefueg> It says it 

[21:47] <plizzat5> @carlitosmartell lol 

[21:47] <neospartanhesperos9> @thesupervillain543 yea, he didn’t do uber kommanders tho 
[21:47] <nazgull 15xd> the next game you all have to be exited about is the new metro 

[21:47] <daymanfighter> Warn all you want this streamer is a toxic gas bag I have no concerns of a ban. I have 
never seen anyone play on such an easy level and act like the game was stupid because they could roll it. This 
dude is a joke. 

[21:47] <deadshotl30> what are uber commanders? 

[21:48] <thatanonybear> https://clips.twitch.tv/SassyHedonisticLardDancingBanana 

[21:48] <guy_incognito_> if prayers were worth anything there would be tax on them

[21:48] <thesupervillain543> im looking forward to the next innovative game franchise, been a ton of sequels 
but i have faith that day will come 

[21:48] <breath321> @guy_incognito_ nothing useful is actually free 

[21:48] <popsicolo> RETURN THE SLAAAAAAAAB 

[21:48] <popsicolo> OR SUFFER MY CUUUURSE 

[21:48] <bammbino> @Daymanfighter what else triggered you?

[21:49] <bammbino> @ThatAnonyBear <3

[21:49] <neospartanhesperos9> it dosnt matter, anony, i wouldn’t have banned 
[21:50] <plizzat5> nice 

[21:50] <bethefueg> Whata€™s a banana party entail? 

[21:50] <bammbino> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 he had a time out already and kept going 
[21:50] <breath321> game has a lot of content though looks like 
[21:50] <thatanonybear> @BeTheFueg "banana" the trolls 

[21:50] <popsicolo> Why do people bother watching things they don’t like? Are humans born to cling to 
suffering? 

[21:50] <paddingtonbearl87> neh vader 

[21:50] <yolodopper> cheer 10 do they have dollar only stores in egypt? 

[21:50] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 dude did nothing but bitch, we’re better than that 
[21:50] <neospartanhesperos9> i want oranges, not bananas BabyRage 
[21:51] <paddingtonbearl87> yes ps4s for a doll hair. 

[21:51] <breath321> @Popsicolo I mean, Sword Art Online or Transformers for example, I love watching them 
to point out how bad they are, in a way I like hating them, maybe these people are the same way 
[21:51] <bammbino> i dont think they had anying close to being as expensive as $1 
[21:51] <plizzat5> is there really a new xbox? 

[21:51] <bammbino> ya xbox one x 

[21:51] <paddingtonbearl87> heee poe 

[21:51] <thatanonybear> what a very expressive child 

[21:52] <neospartanhesperos9> there's a lot of things i don't like and i just keep away 
[21:52] <thatanonybear> he was in line for the role of Annie 

[21:52] <popsicolo> It’s hard to tell. Even the people who love to hate SAO don't usually have channels 
dedicated to nothing but shitting on it. 

[21:52] <guy_incognito_> the merchant should have been an israelite 
[21:52] <thatanonybear> @guy_incognito_ PL 
[21:52] <thatanonybear> *PLS 
[21:52] <plizzat5> @bammbino how much? specs? 

[21:52] <neospartanhesperos9> i like her hair TriHard 

[21:52] <popsicolo> This child invented lootboxes. Kill him now to save the future. 

[21:52] <breath321> @Plizzat5 It'll be 30 fps max, so probably not even worth 
[21:52] <bammbino> idk the details but it actually does 4k and 60fps 
[21:53] <bammbino> @Breath321 nope, 4k 60fps lol 
[21:53] <breath321> @Bammbino I doubt that, either one or the other. 

[21:53] <paddingtonbearl87> xecT naraq 
[21:53] <plizzat5> how much $? 



[21:53] <thatanonybear> Destiny 2 on Xbox One X is 30fps 

[21:53] <bammbino> @Breath321 i HATE xbox too, sucks to admit they're better than ps4 pro 
[21:53] <bammbino> destiny 2 is optimized for pc, not console 
[21:53] <bammbino> destiny 2 is the same engine that ps3 held back 

[21:54] <paddingtonbearl87> @bammbino xbox one S is also more powerful than the ps4 slim Kappa 
[21:54] <thatanonybear> Jim Sterling got and Xbox One X for free, dspFun fact 
[21:54] <paddingtonbearl87> and im a sony guy too 

[21:54] <jelseal973> Phil one of the buttons will let you auto travel, try holding down one of them. 

[21:54] <bammbino> in order to fix it they gotta make a new engine., but judging how destiny 2 died in 2 
weeks., i’d say they wont change shit 

[21:54] <breath321> Honestly, I don’t care about 4k at all. I’d rather have uncapped framerates, so I probably 
won't get the new xbox 

[21:54] <plizzat5> I want an xbox just not sure what version 
[21:55] <jelseal973> You must be on the path 

[21:55] <paddingtonbearl87> @plizzat5 get the S theres great sales for black friday 
[21:55] <dukexjt> Get Xbox X 2 

[21:55] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil they fixed it sorta.. you press X to follow the PATH of the road., you have 
to press triangle when it asks you to follow a path to the mission 
[21:55] <bethefueg> Get the 360 

[21:55] <popsicolo> Time to use a scroll of Icarian Flight 
[21:55] <plizzat5> xbox seems like the best value 
[21:56] <popsicolo> Wait wrong game 
[21:56] <bethefueg> It has the best games 
[21:56] <bammbino> fast travel back to siwa 

[21:56] <paddingtonbearl87> @plizzat5 especially since theres backwards compatibility 
[21:56] <guy_incognito_> get the r zone BCWarrior 

[21:56] <breath321> I’ve never had a console before, I was gonna buy a ps4 to play bloodborne, but when I 

learned it was 30fps I gave up on it 

[21:56] <plizzat5> is the there really an xbox x 

[21:57] <deadshotl30> Bloodborne is worth it tho 

[21:57] <bammbino> X then triangle! @DarksydePhil then you can use your phone 

[21:57] <dukexjt> Get a PC ps4 and xbox one sucks 

[21:57] <breath321> Eh, worth buying a ps4 just for it? I don't think so 

[21:57] <paddingtonbearl87> google it ya stewbid. xbox one x has been a thing for a while OSsloth 
[21:57] <bammbino> FeelsGoodMan 

[21:57] <deadshotl30> @Breath321 NiOh is also a good exclusive 
[21:57] <bammbino> EOF 

[21:57] <breath321> plus it's not even at a good framerate 
[21:57] <sirnoblex> Nice 

[21:58] <deadshotl30> well NiOh isn't exclusive anymor

[21:58] <jannedaarcl35> loved your commentary tonight 

[21:58] <jannedaarcl35> good stuff 

[21:58] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil theres 1 more mission after this then you're done 
[21:58] <deadshotl30> Ive heard this game is shit, is it worth buying? 

[21:58] <sirnoblex> @deadshotl30 I thought it was fun 
[21:58] <bammbino> this game is the shit, its not shit 
[21:58] <deadshotl30> ok 
[21:59] <anewman03> gg 



[21:59] <deadshotl30> seems cool, I like the environment 
[21:59] <deadshotl30> heard the combat was good too 
[21:59] <guy_incognito_> i do not like the voice acting in this game 
[21:59] <bethefueg> To each their own 

[21:59] <breath321> it seems pretty easy though, although phil is playing on easy 
[21:59] <paddingtonbearl87> bethe fueg TPFufun

from all outlets 

[22:00] <bammbino> @deadshotl30 cohhcarnage was left impressed when he beat it 
[22:00] <bethefueg> Someone says youa€™re close to the end 

[22:00] <neospartanhesperos9> Ethan Allen and the Green Back Mountain boys CoolStoryBOb 

[22:00] <paddingtonbearl87> some NUDNIK 

[22:00] <neospartanhesperos9> CoolStoryBob 

[22:00] <paddingtonbearl87> always with the bahhhhb neo 

[22:00] <breath321> Is there any chance Bloodborne will come to PC or nah? 

[22:01] <popsicolo> No. 

[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> lets jus say dont hold your breath 

[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> LUL 

[22:01] <breath321> Oh well 

[22:01] <plizzat5> my gawf 

[22:01] <paddingtonbearl87> CAHMAAAN LUL 

[22:02] <bammbino> spot on 

[22:02] <romethedrone> some of this dialogue is comical 
[22:02] <neospartanhesperos9> @Breath321 Hell no, buddy. LUL 

[22:02] <breath321> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 lmao guess I'll just watch a playthrough then 

[22:02] <bammbino> not too many, but yes 

[22:03] <paddingtonbearl87> well folks 

[22:03] <bammbino> you could easily 100% the side quests 

[22:03] <paddingtonbearl87> TPFufun 

[22:03] <flip 1700> You'll only go to like one more region if you only do the main quest, you're 80% done, the 
game ends at level 35 

[22:03] <flip 1700> Maybe more like 90% if you don't count the upcoming grind 

[22:04] <bammbino> @flipl700 i assume you played it too! do you want AC to follow this style of game? 

[22:04] <breath321> @DarksydePhil Have you ever considered playing any multiplayer games for a while and 
trying to improve at them? a lot of streamers do this and it's pretty entertaining, would be a nice switch up 
[22:05] <paddingtonbearl87> fuck i gotta PEE 

[22:05] <paddingtonbearl87> oh the body off the tower was the highlight 

[22:05] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil true, its better to play than to watch 

[22:05] <neospartanhesperos9> @Breath321 He's doing fps mps over the weekend i thi nk 

[22:05] <bammbino> you make it fun 

[22:05] <rayneepsilion3> mvci?? 

[22:05] <paddingtonbearl87> boom madda facka 

[22:05] <breath321> seems good 

[22:06] <bammbino> was fun all, take care 

[22:06] <flip 1700> @Bammbino Yeah, the game is pretty enjoyable, I've only played a few other Assasin's 

Creed games but I think this game is the proper way to modernize the series, as games like Assasin's Creed 2 feel 

somewhat dated already
