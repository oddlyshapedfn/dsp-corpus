[13:23] <sueekonlemon> Every youtuber has a patreon now 

[13:23] <butter_my_bread> OW nailed the lootbox. i dont begrudge eompanies making money when it's 

mainly eosmetie 

[13:23] <rewindedsun> dlmPride 

[13:23] <majinboo3> He still needs to play final fantasy 12 remaster 

[13:23] <bethemadeagle> jim i just eheeked whieh games where under 10 pound on the store and saw buneh of

[13:24] <inoaseywetrust> Whata€™s max level? 

[13:24] <majinboo3> He had no elue where any european eountry was EOE 

[13:24] <butter_my_bread> alternate revenue streams dont have to inherently give players an inferiorty 



complex 

[13:24] <korewasugoi> Warframe has great micro transaction system. Big AAA companys should take notes 
from Digital Extremes. 

[13:24] <theycallmejimbob> wont there be a Christmas sale on the store BetheMadEagle ? 

[13:24] <bethemadeagle> deep i done 1 art, english, chemistry and gym class and failed english 2 lol

[13:25] <butter_my_bread> anyway im sure they'll patch it (hopefully very soon) 

[13:25] <karlis_k> oheer500 Thank you! someone who speaks common sense for a change - if a game developer 
can't make a game for under 60$ it's their damn fault... if you want to sell a game for 100+ $ it damn well run at 
90fps and have massive content. 

[13:25] <bethemadeagle> deep english is hard though and i speak it on a daily basis 
[13:25] <darkciders> EA raped the Star Wars franchise #MeToo 
[13:25] <suffernl87> Maijnbool'm pretty sure it would though 

[13:25] <theycallmejimbob> didn't Dice stop the purehases of lootboxes temporarily for SWB2 dspHmm 
[13:25] <suffernl87> Yay I hope you he do 
[13:26] <xchariots_> Why am I toxic

[13:26] <bethemadeagle> ery? isnt that pewdiepies friend? 

[13:26] <gamemaster2003isdead> hell yeah this sounds fun 

[13:26] <deepdrive3254> all those crosswords can be hard...unless you cheat of course 

[13:26] <phil_is_my_daddy> @Karlis_K 90fps is currently impossible on modern day TV's with HDMI, 

unfortunately. 

[13:27] <methr011ms> wait who is he playing with 

[13:27] <theycallmejimbob> I think so BetheMadEagle dspHmm 

[13:27] <nazzrax> snawrt 

[13:27] <deepdrive3254> no pewdiepie cries all the time :D 

[13:27] <karlis_k> @Phil_is_my_Daddy it was an overexaggeration 

[13:27] <verykorean> i lost the game 

[13:27] <aes0411> Doing what? I wasn't paying attention 

[13:27] <theycallmejimbob> Cryaotie and tolomeor 

[13:27] <wxrxaxtxh> luptime 

[13:27] <darkcorevexxed> will phil be playing dw9 when it comes out? 

[13:27] <bethemadeagle> jim welp i hope phil plays with him even thoug i will never wateh a stream during that 
time 

[13:27] <verykorean> @DarksydePhil is this battlefront 1? 

[13:27] <korewasugoi> One word : Nintendo 
[13:28] <xohariots_> Please dona€™t 

[13:28] <theycallmejimbob> if he's playing during the early hours of the morning BetheMadEagle dspHmm you 
might be able to watch some of it while you're eating your cornflakes 

[13:28] <chairmancaleb> I mean, as long as progression isn't locked behind a paywall for these games, I don't 




personally see a problem. 

[13:28] <bethemadeagle> jim how you know i eat eornflakes....anyway i might cateh it 
[13:28] <rotoeh4mp> damn eornflakes would be niee now 

[13:28] <phil_is_my_daddy> eheerlO Their exeuse is that game budgets are so high to the point they have to 
have miero-transaetions in games so they ean make baek that profit lol. What ehanged so mueh in the last 
generation that eaused the budgets to be that high? 

[13:29] <verykorean> battlefront 2 isnt out yet? 

[13:29] <eookiemonster414> Its Time For Wookie Cookies 

[13:29] <darkeorevexxed> eheerl will phil be playing dynasty warrriors 9 when it eomes out? eheerl eheerl 
eheerl eheerl eheerl eheerl eheerl eheerl eheerl 

[13:29] <wxrxaxtxh> im getting whispers from a troll using the n bomb. wtf. 

[13:29] <bethemadeagle> wookie eookies sounds niee right now 
[13:29] <darthradovanvikmg> don't go over budget. 

[13:29] <darthradovanvikmg> problem solved 
[13:29] <sueekonlemon> Phil will not play pubg ? 

[13:29] <xeranarth> What game budget? We've got, what, 300 man dev teams? That's not budgeting. That's 
bloating your staff to turn games into a Chinese Sweat Shop. 

[13:29] <paddmgtonbearl87> @darthradovanvikmg easier said than done 
[13:29] <mjll986> Also ealled "Kiss our ass" 

[13:30] <darthradovanvikmg> I do that every month 

[13:30] <stuart360> So they are admitting that they ripped us eonsumers off in the 8bit/16bit days when a team 

of 5 people spent a month to make a game and still eharge us $60 

[13:30] <darthradovanvikmg> so it cant be that hard 

[13:30] <aes0411> It's not a lack of skill/knowledge. It's greedy mindset 

[13:30] <paddmgtonbearI87> thats you 

[13:30] <clutchmanI973> lack of skill,like your gameplay lol 

[13:30] <chairmancaleb> @Xeranarth I mean....games are very much different these days compared to the 80's. 
[13:30] <xeranarth> I know. Chairman. I know. For better and worse. 

[13:30] <theycallmejimbob> will we make a bet on how many crashes today BetheMadEagle dspHmm 
[13:30] <xchariots_> @clutchmanl973 facts lol 

[13:30] <bethemadeagle> so publishers demand and that fucks the true devs up ok got it 
[13:30] <rotoch4mp> problem is people still buying the games 

[13:30] <gaffeire> not really true, the space between GTA titles was small. Vice City came out one year after 
GTA3 

[13:31] <cookiemonster414> :0 

[13:31] <bethemadeagle> jim well i already got one 

[13:31] <bethemadeagle> :D 

[13:31] <korewasugoi> you were queuing, and i put you in the match 

[13:31] <jonathan_snow> tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI tppowerAIYIYI 

[13:31] <korewasugoi> it* 

[13:31] <handwander> he unboxed a match 

[13:31] <darkcorevexxed> what 

[13:31] <verykorean> so why didn you close the game 

[13:31] <theycallmejimbob> did Phil play Hyrule Warriors dspHmm 

[13:31] <jonathan_snow> unboxed a MAtch phil that's new 

[13:31] <zombiebeer> he unboxed a glitch 

[13:31] <succkonlemon> Thats a good start LUL 

[13:31] <bethemadeagle> i say 10 jim to be fair probably wont be that much but 1-0 to me 
[13:31] <jonathan_snow> i wonder what you got now 
[13:31] <cookiemonster414> its the new lootbox hotness Kappa 
[13:31] <theycallmejimbob> what were they thinking NotLikeThis 

[13:31] <deepdrive3254> well microtransactions have nothing to do with the game devs its from the publishers 



[13:32] <secretbossfight> You had a 2% chance of having a great game Kappa 
[13:32] <britishgamingblack> eheerlO quality assuranee at its greatest 
[13:32] <bethemadeagle> deep true

[13:58] <chairmancaleb> @lButtonDash Unless its progression locked behind a paywall, 1 don't see "More 

options" as a reason to not get a game. Just don't support those other options.

[14:06] <solidussnakex> @Vendatus Without Christian Bale as Batman 1 have no interest in watching it 
[14:06] <trihard41iife> 1 prefer Phil playing single player games but o well., less rage 
[14:06] <suomi2013> i smell the rage <3 :D 
[14:06] <chairmancaleb> @TriHard4Eiife Whatever the PvP cap is.

[14:06] <deepdrive3254> i was pushing for call of duty theycallmejimbob 
[14:06] <deepdrive3254> this works too though 

[14:06] <neospartanhesperos9> New DC movies ResidentSleeper = Marvel Residentsleeper 
[14:07] <trihard41iife> super hero movies ResidentSleeper 
[14:07] <trihard41iife> ResidentSleeper 

[14:07] <theycallmejimbob> good choice too deepdrive3254 dspHmm 
[14:07] <sardarkh> Oh boy, look at all those shiny loot boxes 

[14:07] <stuart360> A lot of pop in and loading stutters. 1 think this game is pushing the PS4 to its limits 
[14:07] <vendatus> hm Bale was a decent Batman but a terrible Bruce imo 
[14:07] <mrjekylll6> Too many super hero movies indeed 
[14:07] <theycallmejimbob> :D it would indeed BetheMadEagle 

[14:07] <bethemadeagle> both the the mp late night streams phi has slightly raged not above a 8 though

[14:08] <bethemadeagle> heck we already heard it a lot 
[14:08] <tengu_stoner> CoolStoryBob 

[14:08] <theycallmejimbob> 1 think MvC infinite is the threshold for rage in a MP game dspHmm 1 think he was 
around a 9 to 10 during that at times 
[14:08] <21 ltrill> stuart360 then get a pro 
[14:08] <sardarkh> Toolboxes improve framerate 



[14:08] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob do not want 

[14:08] <greasyscapegout> forsenOMEGA

[14:09] <21 ltrill> stuart360 sounds like you need a ps5 then 
[14:09] <cademolisher> maybe time to uninstall 

[14:09] <theycallmejimbob> BetheMadEagle oh you're right there those were some crazy crazy nights 
[14:09] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob far far from it., idk how it could be entertaining xD 
[14:09] <greasyscapegout> forsenOMEGA 

[14:09] <stuart360> 1 may get a X though at some point, just to stiek in front of the TV 

[14:09] <deepdrive3254> well whatever you think of those games the rage was entertaining during those days 

[14:09] <bethemadeagle> and i wasnt around for that lol 

[14:09] <shoshone> i saw that grenade bro 

[14:09] <sardarkh> Toolboxes silence granade noise 

[14:09] <bethemadeagle> just like i wasnt around for cod 

[14:09] <paenton> that grenade was loud 

[14:10] <theycallmejimbob> the rage is kinda funny TriHard4Fiife but for some people they don't like too mueh

[14:11] <methr011ins> that was the same guy 

[14:11] <seeretbosslight> lta€™s like Overwatch you gotta get on the point and camp it in OT 

[14:12] <bethemadeagle> i remember fighting with ehigo and bassoon over vader or boba in battlefront 1 no one 

wanted palpatine :D 

[14:12] <butter_my_bread> a lousy 210 credits lol 

[14:12] <theycallmejimbob> Yeah 1 agree with you there TriHard4Fiife though Td rather see MvC Infinite 
compared to something like dishonored death of the outsider 

[14:12] <butter_my_bread> fuck EA 

[14:12] <onlinecombosonly> No 

[14:12] <teamguardanator> droids are not empires... 

[14:12] <neospartanhesperos9> Genosis Droids 

[14:13] <trihard41iife> @theycallmejimbob dishonored was shit no? 

[14:13] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil 1 would recommend the tank 1 onee got 24,00 points using the 
tank 



[14:13] <theycallmejimbob> it seemed very generie to me TriHard4Liife :D 
[14:13] <vendatus> wait are there no destroyer droids? WutFaee 

[14:13] <neospartanhesperos9> Kasbykk at night seems terrifying, ean't imagine holding off an army of droids 
like that at night lol 
[14:13] <arnity> lol 

[14:13] <stuart360> Death of the Ouitsider had some funny rage in the playthrough thouugh Jimbob 
[14:13] <seeretbosslight> Prequels should have had more of this 

[14:13] <butter_my_^bread> Death of the Outsider was reeeived pretty well 

[14:14] <sardarkh> Thriving gameplay 

[14:14] <methr011ins> defeated by OG Phil :o

[14:14] <handwander> Piek a vehiele, get more points in that, then piek Vader. It's easier to get a ton of points 
using those than the normal elasses 1 think. 

[14:14] <seoretbosslight> Phil v Phill 

[14:14] <neospartanhesperos9> isn't Bossk the lizard 

[14:15] <theyeallmejimbob> you're right there stuart360 for the first eouple of hours it was pretty tame :D

[14:16] <lbuttondash> the aim assist is minimal, it doesn't loek on like la noire 
[14:16] <depleet420> no its easy 

[14:16] <trihard41iife> @depleet420 he had 11 kill streak before so 
[14:16] <vendatus> turrn the brightness up then EUE 

[14:16] <stuart360> This runs at 4k/60 with top setting on the X, i ean't even do that on my 980ti PC, well not 
with lowering a few settings. 

[14:16] <sardarkh> Contrary to popular opinion, there's no aim assist without a speeifie loot box's star eard 
[14:16] <hankhillpropanegod> How many loot orates have you bought Phil tdogRat tdogCoin 
[14:16] <darkoiders> mmmm look inside you must, to harness light within

[14:17] <methr011ins> doesnt phil have glasses 

[14:17] <sardarkh> No, seriously, more than a game this is wartime training marine bootoamp with all these

[14:17] <stuart360> 1 thought these night fights were pretty cool to be honest 
[14:18] <infinite_sphere> theres a thing called gamma correction, in the game. 

[14:18] <theycallmejimbob> :o you madman BetheMadEagle were they on your team? 

[14:18] <stunted> @stuart360 4k 60 sure, but 1 could do that with all the graphical settings turned to low on 

something much lower than a 980ti 

[14:18] <bethemadeagle> jim yes lol 

[14:18] <hankhillpropanegod> Chaotic tdogRat

[14:18] <deepdrive3254> well that was probably back when he was a maddog jimmy 
[14:18] <bethemadeagle> i pretended to throw it at enemies but it was where they were 
[14:18] <stuart360> Oh i can hit 4k/60 on my PC, i just have to olower a few stuff like shadows, otherwise it 
drops into the 50's and 40's

vader through just using assault.

[15:08] <masternutella> Yeah but they are locked 

[15:08] <leewanner> I think this game would be a lot better if you didn't have to save up for different heroes and 
then have that amount to nothing in the end... It would be better if you could select any hero and they have 
balanced strengths and weaknesses. 

[15:08] <masternutella> Cuz EA 

[15:08] <brotherbeefus> They're really not hard to unlock 
[15:08] <vendatus> okay im gonna try another dspAngrydsp

[15:32] <bobbi_ling> carry me phil Kreygasm - phils team 

[15:32] <butter_my_^bread> there are some ppl that are beasts on the sticks, i personally use Kontrol Freeks 

when i play on console and im about as good as i am with a mouse, it's an acquired talent just look at pro CoD 
players 

[15:32] <theycallmejimbob> :D Bobbi 

[15:33] <vendatus> Jimbob now we need dspCena LUL 

[15:33] <wxrxaxtxh> @Butter_My_Bread i have a control freek on the right stick, definetly helps with 

precision 

[15:33] <theycallmejimbob> that would be a good emote Vendatus :D 

[15:33] <uf08mycat00> Yeh aiming great with the sticks takes skill 

[15:33] <joeblah> wrekt 

[15:33] <bobbi_ling> dsp jabe is insane 

[15:33] <bobbi_ling> kane* 

[15:33] <chaosalltheway> bang 

[15:33] <loboconliavel> @uf08mycat00 and tons of aim assist 

[15:33] <subz3r0wins> Phil you can spam wall hacks with REY and get loads of assits and win the game 
[15:33] <ufD8mycat00> Not really 

[15:33] <sprank_n> "Getting slaughtered from behind" sounds lewd Kappa 
[15:34] <katexo234> LUL LUL 
[15:34] <bobbi_ling> rey has fans? 

[15:34] <ratchefanl2> lool 

[15:34] <magoiichi> oh come on are you serious? Oh wait we won lol 
[15:34] <bobbi_ling> thats sad LUL 

[15:34] <ufD8mycat00> Aim assist is good when u are a beginner, but once you get good, it can actually hurt ur 
aim imo 

[15:34] <infmite_sphere> did phil level up today?? 

[15:34] <masonevans47> Do you think this game is worthy buying? 

[15:35] <ufD8mycat00> No 




[15:35] <ufD8mycatOO> Lol 

[15:35] <darthradovanviking> probably a different shoe color for Hans Solar 
[15:35] <katexo234> dsplootcrate LUL dspHmm 
[15:35] <bobbi_ling> mouse will always be better. 

[15:35] <sprank_n> to the left to the left 
[15:35] <ufD8mycat00> Yeh exactly phil. It's annoying 
[15:35] <liphytuog> bugged aim assist mechanics 
[15:35] <bobbi_ling> han solar system 

[15:35] <butter_my_^bread> try left stick aiming more phil. u can aim while always strafing it's very 

advantageous 

[15:35] <chairmancaleb> Get this man an SSD for his PS4 
[15:35] <k9warriorxx6> The game has Aim Assist 
[15:36] <k9warriorxx6> 1 think you can take it off 
[15:36] <bobbi_ling> tell me a consone fps that has no aim assist 

[15:36] <butter_my_^bread> DriftOr imparted that method to me. very beneficial in gunfights especially in COD 

[15:36] <masternutella> Lol Bobbi 

[15:36] <ufD8mycat00> There's many u can turn off 

[15:36] <kushiyakitori> his character hasn't leveled up yet? thats odd. 

[15:37] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> McCree aim assist SeemsGood 
[15:37] <ufD8mycat00> Unsure if this game has it though 

[15:37] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> progression system based on p2w lootboxes EleGiggle 

[15:37] <stuart360> 1 play on PC with a controller and its tough against M/KB players. Luckily i dont give a shit 

about stats so its still fun 

[15:37] <bobbi_ling> has there been any fetts? 

[15:37] <butter_my_^bread> @bobbi_ling R6 Siege doesn't i believe 

[15:37] <bobbi_ling> isnt r6 peer to peer 6Yn£

[15:39] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> ^ 

[15:39] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil The more cards you unlock the more slots and upgrades you get 

[15:39] <lord_dink> all EA/Dice games are these upgrade RPG point stuff now 

[15:39] <bobbi_ling> no hes the guy that twerks on stream 

[15:39] <ufD8mycat00> Is it even possible to be bad with mouse? Fol 

[15:39] <masternutella> Right?! 

[15:40] <lord_dink> can you use a 360 controller on this game? 

[15:40] <butter_my_^bread> @lord_dink just wait for the new Battlefield next year FMo 

[15:40] <speed8711> Hey Dsp. Howa€™s it going? Wet snort, Dry snort, DEVOUR, DEVOUR!

[15:40] <butter_my_bread> Imao* 

[15:40] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @uf08mycat00 unless you have a shitty mouse 
[15:40] <stuart360> You ean use a 360 eontroller on PC yeah. 

[15:40] <bobbi_lmg> yes ufo mouse is sensitive if you are use to a par

[15:41] <chaosalltheway> MingLee Takodana? 

[15:41] <bobbi_ling> SYD balls 

[15:41] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil That card level is based on how many cards you have unlocked 
for that class 

[15:41] <butter_my_^bread> Mice dont have balls anymore markTongue 

[15:41] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> console loading time ResidentSleeper 
[15:41] <lobos01dier> that tie fighter sound Kreygasm 
[15:41] <koolandyyyy> silky smooth 720p 30 fps 
[15:41] <chaosalltheway> PS4 is so outdated 
[15:42] <masternutella> Is this really 720p? 

[15:42] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> star wars sound design always Kreygasm 
[15:42] <lord_dink> i think it shrinks it to 720p 
[15:42] <bobbi_ling> is boba fett overpowered again? 

[15:42] <masternutella> ps4 can't handle this game at 1080p what lol 

[15:43] <katexo234> TPFufun 

[15:43] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> weebs VoHiYo 

[15:43] <lord_dink> i like the forest maps i'd probably avoid the fighting and just wander around the forest 
[15:43] <dole94> you hit the wall 

[15:44] <darthradovanviking> 1 seem to remember phil hiding with bobafett on the last game and no one could 
reach him because he flew a place with his jetpack 

[15:44] <bobbi_ling> boba fett vs deadpool rap is CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit 

[15:44] <koolandyyyy> you hit the pillar 

[15:44] <koolandyyyy> ok dude 

[15:44] <stuart360> PS4 is struiggling with this game 

[15:44] <theycallmejimbob> MindManners katexo234 

[15:44] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> imagine an uncharted like star wars game Kreygasm 
[15:44] <chaosalltheway> that wasn't headshot tho danFine 

[15:44] <grandpa_gohan> that's only cuz stormtrooperz never hit anything 

[15:44] <bobbi_ling> Jim likes deadpool dspHmm 

[15:44] <uf08mycat00> This seems worse then the first game? 

[15:44] <neospartanhesperos9> deadpool is hilarious 
[15:45] <ufD8mycat00> Seems to chaotic 
[15:45] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> it is worse 

[15:45] <theycallmejimbob> 1 haven't seen the movie yet Bobbi NotLikeThis 
[15:45] <shoshone> rekt 

[15:45] <neospartanhesperos9> i dont watch deadpool cause he's a super hero but because he's a comedian LUL 
[15:45] <kushiyakitori> detonite charge 

[15:45] <bobbi_ling> am i the only one that hates the deadpool movie? trash!! 

[15:45] <butter_my_^bread> is there friendly fire? i didn't think there was 

[15:45] <masternutella> 1 like it 

[15:45] <theycallmejimbob> sure whatever you say game SeemsGood 
[15:45] <stuart360> 1 couldn't even finish the movie Bobbi, i thought it sucked 
[15:45] <katexo234> welp dspNothing 
[15:46] <bobbi_ling> gewd 








[15:46] <kushiyakitori> i didn't think there was friendly fire either, not sure why a grenade would eause it and 
not bullets 

[15:46] <darthradovanviking> 1 thought the movie was ok. But 1 have no other retention to the eharaeter then that 
movie @Bobbi_Ling 

[15:46] <ehaosalltheway> he teleported LUL 

[15:46] <masternutella> It wasn't friendly fire it showed han solo killing them 
[15:46] <deadsquidalive> Solo'd 
[15:46] <kushiyakitori> rolled 

[15:46] <vendatus> Logan was better than Deadpool LUL 
[15:46] <dole94> he used Meree dodge 
[15:46] <kakademona2> pay more attention 
[15:46] <grandpa_gohan> Han shot 1st 

[15:46] <butter_my_^bread> @darthradovanviking the game was eriminally underrated 

[15:46] <bobbi_ling> han solo is overpowered vidar you hear me? 

[15:46] <eookiemonster414> i think phil needs a new ps4 maybe the pro. 

[15:47] <neospartanhesperos9> Logan was the best super hero movie since like... DarkKnight. 

[15:47] <darthradovanviking> oh ok Butter my bread 
[15:47] <stuart360> 4k on the X, 1296p on the 'Pro' lol 
[15:47] <shoshone> usually a good idea to look around first Phil 
[15:47] <cookiemonster414> Kappa 
[15:47] <ratchefanl2> Murdered fro mbehind remix? lol 
[15:47] <bobbi_ling> phils storm trooper looks female? 

[15:47] <darthradovanviking> is it real 4k though or just some upscaled bs? 

[15:47] <butter_my_^bread> phil doesn't have a 4k tv 

[15:47] <masternutella> Its 720p 
[15:47] <masternutella> lol 

[15:48] <stuart360> Dynamic 4k Viking, but its mostly 4k according to Digital Foundry 
[15:48] <masternutella> Oh the pro? 

[15:48] <bobbi_ling> storm troopers are only camo if it snows 

[15:48] <ufD8mycat00> 4K is partly pointless if you aren't using high res textures 

[15:48] <therealkingghidorah> Despite this games flaws 1 still find enjoyment from it. I personally think 

Starfighter Assault is the best mode. 

[15:48] <bentboxer> phil has opportunity to get 4k tv on black friday cheap 
[15:48] <lord_dink> can you do 1080p or 4k on twitch? i never even tried... 

[15:48] <myfellow]ohnson> let's wait 5 years before 4k is really established dude. No reason to fap around with 
it now 

[15:48] <stuart360> The X uses the top PC settings 
[15:48] <kushiyakitori> you missed 
[15:48] <bobbi_ling> 4k in 2017 LUL 

[15:48] <masternutella> Graphics card's price drop on black friday right? 

[15:48] <butter_my_^bread> 4k has more input lag imagine the markRage 

[15:49] <endymionfanclub> xd 
[15:49] <theycallmejimbob> :D Kushi damn 
[15:49] <kakademona2> you did not 
[15:49] <dole94> missed LUL 

[15:49] <masternutella> How much would a gtx 1080 be 

[15:49] <loboconfiavel> like surround sound headphones, a PS4 PRO is pretty much a business investment to do 
this professionaly 

[15:49] <streetdojo> or you missed. 

[15:49] <darthradovanviking> 1 think you can't make out too big a difference when you go from 1080p to 4k. But 

when you do it the other way after having 4k for a while there is really a visual aspect to it 

[15:49] <kushiyakitori> @theycallmejimbob you saw it too though, right? lol to me it looked like the reticle was 




to the right of the enemy 

[15:49] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 1070 will be diseounted a lot with the lOVOti 
[15:49] <bobbi_ling> wheres TheRinger jim? 

[15:49] <theycallmejimbob> :D yeah 1 did KushiYakitori just you risk some backliash saying it 

[15:49] <lord_dink> they should make a star wars movie where the sith win and are handsome and the jedis are 

ugly 

[15:49] <chaosalltheway> I'd buy lOVOti 

[15:49] <masternutella> But how mueh would an gtx 1080 would go for on black firiday 
[15:49] <theycallmejimbob> he's gone to sleep Bobbi :eagle: 

[15:50] <baronvonawesomev> Hahahaha you suck phil get rekted 
[15:50] <myfellow]ohnson> the game just feels so fucking mediocre 
[15:50] <kushiyakitori> @theycallmejimbob lol i guess thats true. 

[15:50] <bobbi_ling> i see dspEw 

[15:50] <katexo234> welp the comeback is still on 

[15:50] <chaosalltheway> you don't really need 1080 if you ain't gonna play on 4K 
[15:50] <neospartanhesperos9> wtf was that ugly ship at the end lol 
[15:50] <v_a_l_o_r_i_o_n> ppl expecting good games from EA ? EleGiggle 
[15:50] <bobbi_ling> Ischedule 
[15:50] <myfellow]ohnson> Y-wing 

[15:50] <nightbot> Nov. 18: Star Wars Battlefront 11 MP at 12:30pm PST! Then Campaign CONCEUSION at 
7:30pm PST! 

[15:50] <masternutella> 1 own a gtx 1060 i'm dont think i want to upgrade to a 1070 lol 
[15:51] <myfellow]ohnson> Battlefield 2 was a good game 
[15:51] <bobbi_ling> conclusion? rush job EUE 

[15:51] <bentboxer> mark hamil looks like a fat karate instructor in trailer 

[15:51] <lord_dink> you can find pretty good priced 1060 on ebay or even 780ti which is about same power as 
1060 

[15:51] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil Murdered from behind remix phil? 

[15:51] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 1440p is the sweet spot for gaming 
[15:51] <neospartanhesperos9> Every Battlefield is a good game TriHard 
[15:51] <loboconfiavel> did he already unlocked the darkie from the movie? 

[15:51] <myfellow]ohnson> Bad company 1 kinda sucked 

[15:51] <masternutella> 780ti is not on pair with the 1060 are you high 

[15:51] <therealkingghidorah> @bentboxer to be fair that's going to be his roll in the film pretty much 
[15:51] <mobilegamesoffical> What happened at Ea wasn't it about the Reddit post 
[15:51] <stuart360> 780ti is much less powerful than a 1060, its similar to a 970 
[15:51] <bobbi_ling> 15 frames per second is also a sweet spot this gen 

[15:51] <theycallme]imbob> aren't graphics cards hella expensive now due to cryptocurrency dspHmm 
[15:52] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil make sure to rack up points in an AT-ST 
[15:52] <lord_dink> there's some recent videos of assassins creed origin testing 970, 780ti and 1060 and all 
about the same 

[15:52] <katexo234> baby wookie? 

[15:52] <lord_dink> like 5 frames difference 
[15:52] <neospartanhesperos9> STOP SHOOTING 
[15:52] <bobbi_ling> is euro lower or higher than a dollar jim 
[15:52] <kakademona2> camp 

[15:52] <neospartanhesperos9> Poor little midgets TearGlove 
[15:52] <darthradovanviking> it is usually higher ling 
[15:52] <darthradovanviking> slightly 

[15:52] <theycallmejimbob> higher Bobbi 1 think 1 euro is 1.20 in dollar 
[15:52] <masternutella> It's not on pair with 1060 lol 
[15:52] <katexo234> neo EUE EUE 




[15:53] <bobbi_ling> no links warning 
[15:53] <theycallmejimbob> dollars* even 
[15:53] <theycallmejimbob> TwitchCop 

[15:53] <chaosalltheway> I'm playing Origins on 970 currently. Stable 60 on high-very high. All you gotta do 
lower your AA to "Low" 

[15:53] <stuart360> A 1060 is pretty much a 980 in power. A 780ti is close to a 970 
[15:53] <masternutella> ^ 

[15:53] <myfellowjohnson> what sucks most about EA is they pushing this Frostbite engine to everyone. Just 

look at Bioware, they should've used unreal engine 4 

[15:53] <bobbi_ling> dilly dilly 

[15:53] <shoshone> Phil actually doing good here 

[15:54] <neospartanhesperos9> i had a dream last night i was playing a game and i lagged in it CoolStoryBob 
[15:54] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 970 is still a really good card 
[15:54] <alukartl77> @Chaosalltheway what res? 

[15:54] <lord_dink> stuart360 youtube search 780ti 1060 and filter this year, lots of tests for different games, 
basically same performance 

[15:54] <kakademona2> lol you made it to their spawn 
[15:54] <chaosalltheway> @Alukartl77 1080p 
[15:54] <ratchefanl2> waaaa shotgun lol 
[15:54] <uf08mycat00> Nerfed shotgun 

[15:54] <masternutella> a 780ti is not on pair with the 1060 just stop dude 

[15:54] <masternutella> lol 

[15:54] <ratchefanl2> shotguns suck lol 

[15:54] <lord_dink> it would be 1080p but that's ok for me i don't have a 4k monitor or tv 
[15:55] <lord_dink> Yes it is, youtube search tests 780ti vs 1060 performance is about the same like 5 frames 
difference most games 
[15:55] <masternutella> lol 

[15:55] <butter_my_^bread> he rolled 

[15:55] <yaylandsharks> why is chat in r9k 
[15:55] <masternutella> You are high 

[15:55] <stuart360> 1 dsont need to do a search because i already know. You might get the odd game where 
performence is somewhat similar, but 5fps is a bigger difference than you think in GPU terms 
[15:55] <gamemaster2003isdead> Jim you still here 
[15:55] <bobbi_ling> cahman LAME 

[15:55] <kakademona2> so we have an excuse for this match 

[15:55] <myfellowjohnson> 1 forgot 1 was watching a porno in another tab lol. brb guys 
[15:55] <masternutella> Stuart he clearly doesn't know about gpu lol 

[15:56] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> if you own a 980 or ti 1 would personally wait for volta cards 
[15:56] <kushiyakitori> theres an indicator for it 
[15:56] <shoshone> it was beeping 

[15:56] <lord_dink> Ok sure i'm high but all the different test videos on youtube show the cards are basically 
same performance.... 780ti = 970 = 1060 

[15:56] <uf08mycat00> Real world performance > which card has the longer bar on a chart 
[15:56] <bobbi_ling> beep beep beeeeeee 
[15:56] <ratchefanl2> lol 

[15:56] <lord_dink> 780ti you can get for like $150 on ebay used 

[15:56] <masternutella> lol 

[15:56] <ass_blastor> dont buy used graphic cards 

[15:56] <theycallmejimbob> damn Lord Dink just seen a Fallout 4 comparison vid and they're similar 
performance wise 

[15:56] <my fellow] ohnson> enough with the gfx card talk. You're putting half the chat in sleep mode

[16:03] <kovorus> DOOD 

[16:03] <wxrxaxtxh> yeah the points system is broken, it should be based on KIEES not points 
[16:04] <ratchet446> @savageronaldo 1 don't know 
[16:04] <liphytuog> "one of the best" EMAO 
[16:04] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> dspEw 

[16:04] <therealkingghidorah> only 2 vehicles 2 heroes and 2 special troops can be active per team 
[16:04] <kakademona2> far from best, half less points 

[16:04] <rewindedsun> so you can only play as heroes if you get enough points? there is no way to practice with 



them in other game modes? 

[16:04] <shoshone> 20 vs 20 is nuts tho 

[16:04] <theycallmejimbob> is it the same on PC 20 players on eaeh team? 

[16:04] <myfellow]ohnson> so is this game a bigger flop than the first game? 

[16:04] <chaosalltheway> you just have to grind more = EA logic LUL 

[16:04] <savageronaldo> how does no one know max level tbb.. I feel like this star wars is worst then the other 
one 

[16:04] <zer033> better than first game where you had to get the icon on the map 
[16:04] <stuart360> The first game sold 14mil copies, it was far from a flop lol 
[16:04] <shoshone> pick a vehicle

[16:06] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @wxrxaxtxh DICE doesn't know how to make a points system. Battlefield 4 
was flawed because you can get 0 kills but be on the top of the scoreboard just by healing and fixing vehicles 
[16:06] <masternutella> lol

weren't too amazing, for that money you ean invest in better solutions 
[16:46] <bobbi_ling> lol vidar 

[16:46] <butter_my_^bread> @kushiyakitori i doubt KB+Mouse is natively supported for this game, u more 

than likely need to invest in an input eonverter like he xim4 
[16:46] <bobbi_ling> That rawr was bae 
[16:46] <butter_my_^bread> the* 

[16:46] <wxrxaxtxh> @KushiYakitori i know you ean use eornus max 
[16:46] <darthradovanviking> you understand wookese or however they say it? 

[16:46] <thatanonybear> @KushiYakitori $150 fueking dollars????? 

[16:46] <oookiemonster414> @darksydephil maybe ehange the sensitivity it eould help? 

[16:46] <masternutella> Ppl really want to use a KB and mouse on eonsole 
[16:46] <ohaosalltheway> your team sucks man 

[16:46] <kushiyakitori> @Butter_My_Bread yeah a convertor like xim 4 is probably best, but there is some 

hori thing that might be supported, endorsed by sony too on their site I think 

[16:46] <theycallmejimbob> Phil is a one man team 

[16:46] <kakademona2> it wont help 

[16:46] <thatanonybear> TALENT PREVAILS

[16:47] <butter_my_^bread> they're pretty frowned upon since you're giving urself an unfair advantage 

especially with the built in aim assist u still get 

[16:47] <kushiyakitori> @ThatAnonyBear yeah, but for $150 you can just get some other input converter which 
s fine 

[16:47] <wxrxaxtxh> @Butter_My_Bread i wouldn't do it, but some people i know already use it, sucks 

[16:47] <theycallmejimbob> is this gonna be the last round dspPepe 

[16:47] <thatanonybear> @KushiYakitori according to Lord Dink, for $150 you could build a NASA 
supercmputer dspHmm
