[11:06] <bethelewd> good win for man u last night 

[11:06] <theycallmejimbob> well BeTheLewd considering he has a 1 in 100 chance of winning the odds are a 
little stacked against me that he’ll win 3 times 

[11:07] <theycallmejimbob> I forgot the games were on and missed it dspPepe 

[11:07] <bethelewd> he cant even play 20 games in this stream so i auto lose with that bet :D 

[11:07] <bethelewd> so this is the alternative 

[11:08] <theycallmejimbob> I dunno if it's pot luck but most places he parachuted into yesterday were not 
densely populated

neutrality is a OBAMA era thing. So classic retard republican ... 

[11:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> :( 

[11:58] <thatanonyraccoon> net neutrality willbe remembered in human history alongside the lead in the 
waterpipes that drove the Romans mad 

[11:58] <iconicchristian> @bethelewd it happened on the 14th 
[11:58] <paddingtonbearl87> well not until your contract expires? 

[11:58] <gamerzillal001> @DarksydePhil the benefit would be it would cost cheaper for those who would only 

say use twitch and if you got multiple packages you would really only pay the same price now 

[11:58] <feignit> BUSINESS CLASS dspHmm 

[11:58] <markymark52> As long as it doesn’t effect Phil it's okay.

money by just only using those

[11:59] <ben_megaman> cheer 15 Hey Phil; good to hear your internet is safe, but it is the businesses that have to 
pay for the costs, not customers. Also, how does the repeal affect you and your GF's line of business? Have you 
two spoken about NN in light of the repeal?

[12:02] <kushiyakitori> people voted in PUBG? surprising 



[12:02] <trihard41iife> I believe in you, USA 

[12:02] <gamerzillal001> @DarksydePhil I highly doubt that businesses would be foolish enough to give us 
sub-par internet if we don’t pay extra but the good news with net neutrality removed it would allow new 
businesses to step in and offer better internet deals! It would be economic suicide to screw over internet 
consumers and then add revenue would be weakened for providers forcing them to offer a decent regular and if 
you pay more you get premium its a win for the poor, the middle, and the rich 
[12:02] <pcgamehunter> It's the obvious conclusion since Pai has been a chairman

[14:59] <pcgamehunter> Octoa OpieOP 

[14:59] <bethebaby> The most popular game on Twitch and Steam this year, folks! Only $29.99 on Xbox! 
[14:59] <eplegutten> Is this game pc and xbox only ? 

[14:59] <calinks> So this game is the Xboxs fault. Microsoft really screwed up 
[14:59] <pcgamehunter> yes 

[14:59] <segregate> so this is what kids are playing these days... 

[14:59] <eplegutten> damn microsoft 

[14:59] <blue_blur64> But you can play Fortnite for free bethe DansGame 
[14:59] <segregate> Kappa 

[14:59] <bethebaby> Releasing shit like this should be illegal. 

[14:59] <eplegutten> ok 

[14:59] <kctronislife> i get 90 fps on pc get rekt kaceyFace 
[14:59] <brokenpotatol23> xbox one x is a scam dont buy it 



[14:59] <kctronislife> then again i never play it 

[14:59] <wxrxaxtxh> dsps clip of getting winning yesteday only has lk views on youtube 
[14:59] <daggerborn81> It's not a release it's early access :/ 

[14:59] <eplegutten> xbox one x is fake news :D 

[14:59] <magicjerryfresh 11> You think the game should get a pass at all since technically it is early access? Or 
is it that bad? 

[15:00] <segregate> strapped 

[15:00] <elzorrobot> panning to the ignorant and immature is a hell of business in the world, specially in America 
[15:00] <segregate> find a bag 

[15:00] <masternutella> The game is still early access? its been months already 

[15:00] <xxxnemesisxxx> @Astrojetboy checked, and didnt find anything unless its in the twitch girls video 
[15:00] <daggerborn81> Should get somewhat of a pass since you know you're buying an unfinished game. 
[15:00] <blue_blur64> You know, looking at this city, that's actually something Fortnite could use. It's towns are 
too small I think 

[15:00] <segregate> click and drag... o wait LUL 
[15:01] <pcgamehunter> LUL 

[15:01] <eplegutten> i want the game Cuphead, but i dont own an xbox one 

[15:01] <bethebaby> @Magicjerryfresh 11 It should not even be available for the public to play. Steam has 
tricked people into thinking that literally being unpaid beta-testers is somehow OK, and that it's OK for devs to 
charge money for unfinished games because it's "early access". 

[15:01] <pcgamehunter> HSWP 

[15:01] <gojirakunpls> @blue_blur64 I agree, Fortnite is waaaay too rural, in my opinion 
[15:01] <astrojetboy> it is the twitch girls video @xxxnemesisxxx 
[15:01] <segregate> its true 4Head 
[15:01] <kctronislife> vohiyolOO its true about the pan 

[15:01] <leonaras> Fortnite is rural because it has building in it, you create your own terrain 
[15:02] <segregate> no its not cmonBruh 

[15:02] <octoa> cheerlO it's true, the frying pan does reflect bullets if they hit the pan 
[15:02] <kctronislife> more emotes PogChamp 

[15:02] <blue_blur64> Well the frying pan is pretty good in TF2, so it could be good in this game Kappa 
[15:02] <eplegutten> yellow wate rin toilet, check. 

[15:02] <pcgamehunter> Steam hasn't taught anything they just siphon all the money into they're massive 
underground tunnel and let people do whatever they want.

[15:45] <shnicklefritzz> why are you crouching everywhere 
[15:45] <lovelybundylon> phil try to kill people 

[15:45] <playcooll8> tbh xbox 1 X is a great PC gaming only budget machine for the price

[15:45] <segregate> yes 
[15:45] <pcgamehunter> L O 

[15:45] <blue_blur64> @futurehades , based on my experience with Fortnite, it's always good to have anything 

on you just in case. I don't go out of my way to kill unless it's a smart kill 

[15:45] <purple_n3rple> @Aedie A pull start is much more reliable than a crank start too. 

[15:45] <brokenpotatol23> the worst part about console is the xbox live and play satation plus crap 
[15:45] <theravenger01> I’d suggest you look up pc build guides for your amount 

[15:45] <aedie> @Butter_My_Bread releasing an alpha build on console for $30 was such a cashgrab by 

butthole entertainment 

[15:45] <kwiktwist> Godamn is he retarded 

[15:45] <playcooll8> but you dont have the freedom a PC has 

[15:46] <theravenger01> can give you a bit of guidance

[15:51] <theravenger01> Phil is a pacifist

[15:53] <shnicklefritzz> should change his name the the observer 

[15:53] <blue_blur64> hold on Aedie 

[15:53] <eplegutten> daytonaaaaa 

[15:53] <pod42> Why not try to fight or something?

[15:54] <aedie> @pcgamehunter I assume this streamer accurately represents his chat LUL 
[15:54] <pod42> Don’t get out and hide for the love of god 
[15:54] <papanachotv> 10 FPS SeemsGood 
[15:54] <kwiktwist> a€oeOmg whoaaa€Q □ 

[15:54] <pod42> Try to get into some action make shit fun 

[15:54] <muinaiset> Doesn’t Microsoft allow Keyboard and Mouse for this game on Xbox? If so, do that 
immediately. 

[15:54] <eplegutten> daytona, lets go away 
[15:54] <futurehades> Go to the action Phil 
[15:54] <lamplight_> don't forget to find a nice hiding place first... 

[15:54] <stuart360> Is this game growing on Phil?, he seems more into it now 
[15:55] <theycallmejimbob> gotta go fast VoHiYo 
[15:55] <reggieface420> phil is driving; death imminent 
[15:55] <superslygaming> stay in vehicle 
[15:55] <shnicklefritzz> crouchcrouchcrouch 

[15:55] <pcgamehunter> @Aedie Actually I think it's actually inversely proportional tbh Kappa

[15:55] <shnicklefritzz> there we go 
[15:55] <jacosal23> 25A£ 

[15:55] <majorkyon> there's a different game mode where it's first-person only, which is what aedie is talking 

about I'm guessing 

[15:55] <theravenger01> $30 

[15:55] <pod42> Wow out of the vehicle and looting more ResidentSleeper 
[15:55] <aedie> @MajorKyon yes, first person only mode

[15:55] <shnicklefritzz> right up your ally 

[15:55] <superslygaming> now camp in this place for 25 minutes 

[15:55] <zombie_gorilla> bath is a good hiding spot lol 

[15:56] <pod42> Healing items are for when you get into combat and lose health 
[15:56] <jumney> keep looting 

[15:56] <darkciders> use your healing items to keep you alive outside the circle 
[15:56] <pod42> But idk if you know about that 
[15:56] <chance86> Not on xbox u dummies 

[15:56] <majorkyon> in that case, no Xbone doesnt have first person mode 
[15:56] <futurehades> Ia€™ve got to go hope it picks up abit for you guys 

[15:56] <eplegutten> I tryed the evil within 2 demo on pc, and there seem to be a lag for picking stuff up, uhave 



to wait 3 seconds

[15:57] <lamplight_> @ezyduzithd being dsp 

[15:57] <blue_blur64> Why does he have to shoot? I keep asking because he doesn't have to shoot when he 
thinks it would be bad to do 

[15:57] <kurojp> Let another guy take his car, let another guy take his girlfriend... 

[15:57] <serpentunderneath> Did I miss him play pubg? Is he going to play again does anyone know??

[15:58] <scruffshark> That guy just got to the center much faster now. Sitting duck or not. By good chances, that 
guy will end up in the center first before Phil. 

[15:58] <amoblivious> oh shit 

[15:58] <aedie> @blue_blur64 because on a normal twitch channel, viewers want action. But I see now that his 
viewers are more entertained by passive play lol 
[15:58] <amoblivious> snake in the fken grass 

[15:58] <ezyduzithd> I haven’t been watching long, has he shot a bullet yet? 

[15:58] <jumney> Phil whats your best finish? 

[15:58] <muinaiset> Console gamers get a inferior taste of what we have on PC and suddenly feel justified in 
owning a potato box LUL LUL 

[15:58] <disorderjunkie> Ya because you’re a girly man 
[15:58] <siestayonjyugo> @Darkciders AHAHAHAHAH IKR?!

[15:58] <majorkyon> that being said, it would be more fun to see action 
[15:58] <superslygaming> what if that guy with the car wins the game 
[15:58] <zombie_gorilla> ml6 

[15:58] <blue_blur64> I support streamers playing the way they want. I don't force them to play to my specific 
opinions 

[15:58] <pod42> Who cares you don’t use them 

[15:59] <ass_blastor> cheer 10 Drink your energy drinks, it'll give you a permanent boost if you already have full 
health

[15:59] <scruffshark> Has he got a single kill this match? 

[15:59] <sartorialbear> M16 always good choice 
[15:59] <pod42> Non way this dude won a game 
[15:59] <disorderjunkie> PC = 144FPS lmfao 
[15:59] <shnicklefritzz> he hasnt shot a single shot yet 

[15:59] <lambentmarkus> also why the fuck are you facechecking houses with your Mini equipped when you 
have a UMP 

[15:59] <aedie> ml6 is the best rifle on the patch you're running 

[15:59] <ezyduzithd> After doing almost lk hours on this on pc i couldn’t play it on console 
[15:59] <shnicklefritzz> omgomgomg golllllld 
[15:59] <eplegutten> who need 144 fps? 

[15:59] <radicalenzyme> LUL 
[15:59] <primernova> It tics away

[15:59] <xeliza_> lol 

[15:59] <shnicklefritzz> gotta do all 10 then get perma boost

[15:59] <futurehades> Is there anybody else in this game or just him 

[15:59] <pcgamehunter> Oh the PC vs consoles debate ? That isn’t older than you parents LUL 
[15:59] <purple_n3rple> I can’t 
[15:59] <radicalenzyme> ... 

[15:59] <blk_mage_ctype> M16 SHOULD be better than an SMG, but it's a video game, so I duno. 

[15:59] <jumney> only lets you regain missing hp 
[16:00] <eplegutten> lol 

[16:00] <muinaiset> Wow, good one @Mis_Diego 

[16:00] <lambentmarkus> and since you have a sniper already you should stick to a UMP 

[16:00] <reggieface420> if u buy the $100 version of pubg you get the special 100 fps deal only available to 

whales

[17:15] <thecowsaysmool0122> DSP, not sure if you are going to see this, but make sure to turn off your dvr in 
xbox settings. That way the game will run faster 

[17:16] <thecowsaysmool0122> Also, if you have the og xbox one hard drive see if you can use a faster hard 
drive 

[17:16] <thecowsaysmool0122> that should help too 

[17:16] <thecowsaysmool0122> I was like you before and frustrated at the game at times. However, these
