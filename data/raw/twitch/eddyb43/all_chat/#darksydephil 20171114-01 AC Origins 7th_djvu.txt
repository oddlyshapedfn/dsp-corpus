[13:56] <neospartanhesperos9> @Haseox4 Well you see, i like to think a glitch on a twitch stream is either 

funny or annonying depending on the perspective of the person who is being addressed. Phil will be annoyed, but 

i will be laughing, however if we address the glitch in general, we just refer to it as 'annoying funny glitch’, so 

yes, it's a hybrid depending on the subject of the sentence. See how that works CoolStoryBob

[14:38] <leonaras> @darksydephil ever considered playing a traditional topdown RPG like Divinity Original Sin 
2? 

[14:39] <chairmancaleb> Oh my god, the guy's hair. 



[14:39] <chairmancaleb> Looks fake as shit. 

[14:39] <friendorfoe33> I'm curious to know if DSP would consider Elex, I just finished it and thought it was 
good overall 

[14:39] <kinggoken> what is Elex 
[14:39] <doctorzzz> isnt it pc only ? 

[14:39] <friendorfoe33> It's console 

[14:39] <doctorzzz> or does it have a console release 

[14:39] <friendorfoe33> new rpg from the makers of Gothic 

[14:39] <friendorfoe33> I got it on xbone 

[14:39] <infinite_sphere> elex is a shitty game made in germany 

[14:40] <kinggoken> lrnao 

[14:40] <friendorfoe33> It's got a learning curve and you have to avoid combat when you start 
[14:40] <doctorzzz> i saw cohh play it a bit and it looked aight altho pretty dated 
[14:40] <friendorfoe33> but I thought the story and setting was cool 
[14:40] <friendorfoe33> holy shit AC: Origins has a 1st person shooting mode? 

[14:40] <paddingtonbearl87> FailFish 

[14:40] <friendorfoe33> I've been avoiding the streams because I didn't want to spoil origins too much before I 
get it 

[14:41] <chairmancaleb> I didn’t realize people still cared about AC's story after the way Ubisoft fucked it with 
AC3's ending. 

[14:41] <friendorfoe33> idk I think Black Flag managed to do very well and bringing it back 

[14:42] <mr_victor_sullivan> ac3 was only one I didn't play 

[14:42] <jbowler21> it's pretty much an rpg assassins creed friendorfoe. 

[14:42] <the_elusiveone45> AC Black Flag was dope 
[14:42] <kinggoken> A 

[14:42] <conky89> This series will probably never reach a proper conclusion... 

[14:42] <doctorzzz> the only ac i ever finished was the first one 

[14:42] <chairmancaleb> @jbowler21 Yeah, that's what I've been getting from watching so far. It’s meh.. 

[14:42] <friendorfoe33> Black Flag, 3, and Brotherhood are my personal favorites 
[14:42] <doctorzzz> got bored of the other pretty quick 
[14:43] <paddingtonbearl87> DoritosChip 
[14:43] <paddingtonbearl87> AngryJack 

[14:43] <the_elusiveone45> How much longer do you guys think Phil will play this game? 

[14:43] <friendorfoe33> shit man, sorry to hear about your ex going on that podcast this morning 
[14:43] <the_elusiveone45> Like, number of streams? 

[14:43] <kinggoken> until he finishes the story 
[14:44] <doctorzzz> he still needs lOlvls to finish 
[14:44] <the_elusiveone45> damn 
[14:44] <doctorzzz> so prolly 4 or 5 more streams 
[14:45] <paddingtonbearl87> kill cunfurmed 

[14:45] <conky89> Act normal. Well in the AC universe, dressing up like a shifty person and armed to the teeth 
with weapons is considered normal 
[14:45] <sirnoblex> For the avenge quest 

[14:45] <the_elusiveone45> I still can't get over how clunky the combat looks. 

[14:45] <jbowler21> the axe is brutal. 

[14:45] <the_elusiveone45> lrnao 

[14:46] <paddingtonbearl87> FUCKED that door up with the axe TPFufun 
[14:46] <beardogay> Is this progress? 

[14:46] <paddingtonbearl87> yes gayboy OpieOP 
[14:47] <beardogay> Its actually Bear Dog 
[14:47] <paddingtonbearl87> oh 
[14:47] <paddingtonbearl87> my bad FailFish 



[14:47] <beardogay> lol 

[14:47] <conky89> Plus he can get bitten by a crocodile, the animal with the most powerful bite force, and not 
give a rip 

[14:47] <kushiyakitori> Ezio was pretty overpowered as well with the hidden blades easily killing people in 
combat 

[14:49] <beardogay> Axe is broken af 

[14:49] <waifudestroyermatt> does this game get harder? 

[14:49] <the_elusiveone45> Ezio had a pistol hidden away in his wrist, in 15th Century Italy lmao. 

[14:49] <paddingtonbearl87> in other words, "fuck all yall" ShazBotstix

[14:52] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil is there a chance you'll do a hateful truth for this? AC is part of your 
legacy(reviews included) 

[14:52] <beardogay> Full circle 
[14:52] <hankhillpropanegod> tdogRat 

[14:52] <the_elusiveone45> I think he’ll talk about it in his year-end videos, but prob. no hateful truth.

[14:53] <the_elusiveone45> when was the last time Phil did a hateful truth? 

[14:53] <waifudestroyermatt> i doubt we;ll see a hateful truth. 1. It requires effort. 2. It won't make money

[16:26] <van_alfreyd> LOL 

[16:26] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Looks like a tell tale cutscene 

[16:28] <chairmancaleb> Right, you had to figure out which side and which angle you would take. 

[16:28] <hindae> Very few of them yeah I guess 

[16:28] <chairmancaleb> And sometimes it’d take like 5 min. 

[16:28] <dylannw> There’s still one in this ac kinda hard tho 
[16:29] <taniaraven> thumb nail says you're playing Need for Speed 

[16:29] <hindae> I hate the term modernization. Casualization is more appropriate but I hate that even more. 
[16:29] <taniaraven> are there Loot Crates in this game? 

[16:30] <grinnyzss> We need to start another bit war here 
[16:30] <zaherking> burp OS sloth 

[16:31] <taniaraven> Phil are there microtransactions in this game?

[16:32] <hindae> Yeah, just look at Skyrim. Morrowind was amazing and then Skyrim was boring as fuck due to 
being too easy 

[16:32] <zaherking> @taniaraven there are heka chests wich you can only buy with in game currency, but u can 
buy that in game currency with microtransactions 
[16:32] <roeygabay> How does he speak under water 
[16:32] <taniaraven> Skyrim difficulty was static 

[16:32] <zaherking> no it is not p2w as it is not a competitive game nor does it have any online interactions other 
tgan leaderboards and photo modes 

[16:33] <haseox4> cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl Will you be getting 
the season pass or will you wait to see what content comes out 
[16:33] <zaherking> than* 

[16:33] <taniaraven> i should have bought this over Battlefront 2 
[16:34] <zaherking> @taniaraven cancel your preorder 



[16:34] <hindae> I mean in the way it was designed Tania, Morrowind had character creation, builds and 
strengths and weaknesses. Skyrim was "level everything dude we got you" 

[16:34] <taniaraven> too late 

[16:34] <zaherking> @taniaraven refund it? 

[16:34] <masonp75> Skyrim was a great game, just not a great RPG 
[16:34] <bobbi_ling> skyrims only good with mods 
[16:34] <taniaraven> can i? 

[16:34] <darkamp_48> sup darksyde, WHAT UP fifiW 

[16:34] <dylannw> AI is very good LUL 

[16:34] <friendorfoe33> has phil completed the main story yet? 

[16:35] <zaherking> @taniaraven where did u buy it from? 

[16:35] <jbowler21> phil during your younger years as a youTuber did you have very many emotional moments 
when the game got sad or dark? 

[16:35] <friendorfoe33> I'm wondering if Origin's has a long story or not 

[16:35] <hindae> I see your point Phil. As an entry point its good, just not good to a returning Elder Scrolls 
player 

[16:35] <darkamp_48> YAY I never met you EVER but YEAAHH fifiHappy 

[16:35] <cinochino> Buy physical, then i can turn it in later 

[16:35] <taniaraven> Microsoft marketplace digital 

[16:35] <bobbi_ling> phil would hate morrowind directions lol 

[16:36] <zaherking> @taniaraven is there an option to refund? 

[16:36] <friendorfoe33> morrowind was really good once you finally got into it 
[16:36] <zaherking> @taniaraven contact microsoft 
[16:36] <darkamp_48> is this open world. I'm sure it is 
[16:36] <darkamp_48> Kappa 

[16:36] <friendorfoe33> but I started with oblivion so it was fucking hard at first 

[16:36] <hindae> Dont get me wrong I LOVE accessibility. Id really like the games to have an easy mode and a 
hardcore mode 

[16:36] <darkamp_48> I like cuphead, it's SO EASY 

[16:36] <0000anonymous> @DarksydePhil all they need to do is make the "difficulty selection" as casual, and 
normal hardcore base 

[16:36] <taniaraven> no. but i can try calling microsoft 
[16:36] <darkamp_48> but stupid friends are annoying me Kappa 
[16:36] <cinochino> Cuphead is not that hard 
[16:36] <darkamp_48> cause I'm good 

[16:36] <friendorfoe33> hey Phil you could try Elex, it just came out and it's decently difficult 
[16:36] <zaherking> @taniaraven pc or console? 

[16:37] <taniaraven> xbox 1 

[16:37] <kjones4140> call microsoft with a soundboard to get info, lol 
[16:37] <chairmancaleb> @HinDae Doesn’t Skyrim have a legendary difficulty? 

[16:37] <klyntje> As a life long gamer since Pong, I like the older stlye games that made the player thing and 
didn’t hold thier hands like new games do. Minecraft was great as you had to figure everything out. Microsoft 
ruined it by adding a tutorial to make it accessable to casuals like every other game now. 

[16:37] <zaherking> @taniaraven ok, try calling microsoft. best of luck 

[16:37] <ragegamingl24> Tbh some people just bitch about games cause they suck at it 6Y~,6Y~,6Y~, 

[16:37] <bobbi_ling> phil needs to expierence morrowind jump spells for travelling LUL 
[16:37] <dylannw> Modern Warfare Remastered on Veteran is insane... phil you should try it LUL 
[16:37] <pacifistoOoOo> It is FAKE 
[16:37] <paddingtonbearl87> WOULD U liiiiiike? OpieOP 

[16:37] <hindae> Yeah but its just a scaling option. No real challenge for when youre level 81 with ridiculous 
enchantments 

[16:38] <kjones4140> Would you liiiiike? 





[16:38] <pacifistoOoOo> totally fake 

[16:38] <xeranarth> Elder Scrolls has never been hard. It just required some thinking before. My opinion, of 
course. 

[16:38] <friendorfoe33> #fakenews 

[16:38] <taniaraven> Phil is this game so far, the best of 2017? 

[16:38] <robbasejr> @Dylannw nothing compared to World At War in veteran! 

[16:38] <hindae> You can go the route theyre taking now, adding that new Hardcore mode thats optional to 
players seeking the challenge 
[16:38] <paeifisto0o0o> phil is fake 

[16:38] <chairmancaleb> I’d definitely pledge to see a Morrowind playthrough. 

[16:38] <kjones4140> i need a cigarette, god 

[16:38] <bobbi_ling> put difficuly slider up full for oblivion, you cant say yhats not hard 
[16:38] <hindae> @kjones4140 Was it that good? Kappa 

[16:38] <friendorfoe33> I’d pledge to see phil try Elite Dangerous with a couple people in his wing 
[16:39] <dylannw> nah, the bonus mssion in MWR is the most hardest mission in COD series 
[16:39] <darkamp_48> YOU FAKE GURL ClappyDerp 

[16:39] <klyntje> That is what game difficulty is for or was. Easy for noobs/Causals, Normal for gamers and 

Hard for replay/a challenge 

[16:39] <kjones4140> @HinDae kinda lol 

[16:39] <hindae> @friendorfoe33 While i love Elite its a game that takes considerable time and effort to really 
unravel 

[16:40] <friendorfoe33> yeah, but once you get into it it become really fun after the learning curve 

[16:40] <kjones4140> she sounds sarcastic as hell 

[16:40] <friendorfoe33> I understand the time is a huge factor though 

[16:40] <darkamp_48> Kappa 

[16:40] <zaherking> @kjones4140 bad voice acting 

[16:40] <kjones4140> Would you liiiiike? 

[16:40] <robbasejr> @Dylannw lol yea that was tough but doable. World at War on veteran was just trying to 

avoid the perfectly thrown grenades from the AI lol 

[16:40] <roeygabay> NA aim FreakinStinkin 

[16:40] <yr0th> That bow is so sick 

[16:40] <cinochino> Spam dem arrows lol 

[16:40] <robbasejr> especially the last mission 

[16:40] <darkamp_48> @DarksydePhil I'm sure it was so easy to save 

[16:40] <hindae> Id more like to see Phil play more indy games, like Hat in Time, Strafe and stuff 
[16:40] <zaherking> @kjones4140 or she just doesnt care that her mother is about to die 
[16:40] <kjones4140> @Zaherking I would say so 
[16:41] <taniaraven> omg was that bandit pulling out an arrow? 

[16:41] <friendorfoe33> is Phil's character wearing a mask? 

[16:41] <darkamp_48> Don’t apologize, it's on MY JOB 
[16:41] <darkamp_48> Kappa 

[16:41] <kjones4140> @DarksydePhil Would you liiiiiike? Its not fake.

[16:42] <velchim> you lose 33% of your health 

[16:42] <hindae> Judging by the icon id say it self damages 

[16:42] <rinkdude> it does really good damage 

[16:42] <klyntje> ...what it thinks you means, you pay a price 

[16:42] <jbowler21> not worth it

[16:43] <hindae> I guess its a risk weapon, high damage for low health 

[16:43] <friendorfoe33> @paddingtonBEAR187 I guess they can't really call the yellow exotic since it'd be too 
close to Destiny 

[16:43] <kjones4140> Only by sacrificing a camel 

[16:43] <paddingtonbearl87> @friendorfoe33 lol thats what i was going by InuyoFace
