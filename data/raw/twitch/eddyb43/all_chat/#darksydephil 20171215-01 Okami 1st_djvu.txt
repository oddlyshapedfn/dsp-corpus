[11:53] <pcgamehunter> I feel so much better PermaSmug 

[11:53] <me_god> happens all the time 

[11:53] <me_god> with psvita to pc ports 

[11:53] <zahvone> DOOM for example breaks over 200 frames per second lol 
[11:53] <kingofhypocrisy> Get the fuck outta here 

[11:53] <theycallmejimbob> you're gonna get socks for Christmas now BeTheLewd :D 
[11:53] <zahvone> and by breaks, I mean it's unplayable (was fixed awhile back) 

[11:53] <thatindieglo> Lay Z 

[11:53] <saitobenkei> It’s locked to 30fps on steam too. :( 

[11:53] <sidella434> i waa born with a liver dissese called coach syndrum 

[11:53] <dukaduka> Xenus PogChamp 

[11:54] <noesnobody> Persona 4 gold should come to console 

[11:54] <me_god> gta3 has the same problem 

[11:54] <cobrastrike09> hey all 

[11:54] <pcgamehunter> PS vita is a console OpieOP 

[11:54] <zahvone> I think every Tenchu game should come to me for free Kappa 
[11:54] <me_god> 30fps or nothing 

[11:54] <popsicolo> This prestream could use some art... dspHmm 



[11:54] <noesnobody> handheld tho 
[11:54] <jbowler21> yea it's long 
[11:54] <zahvone> Pops! 

[11:54] <dukaduka> Persona 4 is still the best persona in my opinion 
[11:54] <zahvone> How's it hangin man 
[11:54] <popsicolo> HeyGuys 

[11:54] <pcgamehunter> @Popsicolo do you accept bitcoin Kappa 

[11:54] <little_blake> no the game logic can’t handle it without sever modifications, enemies hit twice ie 

[11:54] <theycallmejimbob> hey Pops KonCha 

[11:54] <kingofhypocrisy> Drop this and Play San Andreas 

[11:54] <popsicolo> Pretty good. I recovered from a hangover popsicSmug

[11:55] <thatindieglo> Really* 

[11:55] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> San Andreas with music off LUL LUL LUL 

[11:55] <kingofhypocrisy> This game is boring 

[11:55] <bethelewd> pops did chick spike yo drink again 

[11:55] <pcgamehunter> Pops sold the crypto and got his extra 40 bucks and drank it all Kappa 
[11:55] <reggarzl> cheer45 the game engine is tied to the framerate, so if they changed it to 60, everything 
would run at double speed, or other unintended effects could happen. They would have to re-code the entire 
game to have it run at a different FPS 

[11:55] <aes0411> Phil, you can’t expect low attendance for games that are not true classics 

[11:55] <kingofhypocrisy> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz Phil will sing the songs from the radio himself

[11:56] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> thank you thatanony RaccAttack 
[11:56] <matt_friday> What is Okami about? 

[11:57] <pcgamehunter> Probably the cause @Kekon3 Kappa 
[11:57] <kingofhypocrisy> wuuuuuuttttt 

[11:57] <darkciders> so you're saying, there's a guarantee? Kappa 
[11:57] <popsicolo> So who needed the bucket then, BeThe? 

[11:57] <sidella434> @Kekon3 star wars was lit 
[11:57] <dukaduka> LA Noire Kreygasm 

[11:57] <bionich00t> I love that the new Star Wars is all about big black men and all the white boy characters 
aren't important. It's good to have Star Wars and whitey finally respecting the BBC. 

[11:57] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> DICKS WITH GUNS 

[11:57] <popsicolo> Oh wait nevermind 

[11:57] <sprank_n> @Matt_Friday hentai

[11:57] <bethelewd> you pops cause you the one with weak stomach 
[11:57] <fac316> fuck star wars 
[11:57] <dukaduka> press x to Kreygasm 

[11:57] <kekon3> @pcgamehunter Star Wars was p good, have ya seen it? 

[11:58] <pcgamehunter> BTW the La noire playthrough is still up on the hacked sports channel LUL 
[11:58] <bionich00t> The new Star Wars only has a 55%!!!! on Rotten Tomatoes for the audience score 
[11:58] <bionich00t> It's insane 
[11:58] <theycallmejimbob> :D PC 
[11:58] <sidella434> awww 

[11:58] <infinite_sphere> just a heads up, this game is piss easy 
[11:58] <kingofhypocrisy> DICKS WITH GUNS 

[11:58] <bionich00t> Critical score is 90% but audience score for Last Jedi is only 50% 

[11:58] <arcticsurface> LA Noire Kreygasm Kreygasm 
[11:58] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 55% hated the ending 

[11:58] <darkciders> The Telltale Batman series has an episode you didn’t play from a couple months ago 
[11:58] <arcticsurface> Great jazz music again Kreygasm 

[11:58] <pcgamehunter> @Kekon3 Not a fan of the series, also the annoying hype around it made me want to 
see it even less, so no 

[11:58] <kekon3> There's something in the new movie. Something that's spoiler tastic, that people absolutely hte 
[11:58] <dukaduka> @Bionich00t oh shi- is it that bad? Did people finally realize all these Star Wars films 
coming out is a cash grab? 

[11:58] <bionich00t> Phil is dark syde from Superman (darkseid) or Star Wars (dark side) 

[11:58] <pcgamehunter> NUUUU the old LA Noire PL is goooone dspGlitch dspSurpriseddsp 
[11:59] <dukaduka> @Darkciders tbh telltale fell off hard, too many games. 

[11:59] <ps3gamer456> i get better grades than star wars LUL 

[11:59] <paddingtonbearl87> EVERYBODY likes KUNG fu FIGHTING exlayer 

[11:59] <vendatus> dspPepe 

[11:59] <kekon3> @pcgamehunter Ye, that's fair, I was only planning on going if others went. And that's what 
happened

[11:59] <popsicolo> Overwatch madness KappaHD 



[11:59] <pcgamehunter> Now it's replaced by shit football streams DAESuppy 

[11:59] <aes0411> You know why Last Jedi is being slammed by viewers? It is because they don’t judge it on its 
own merit. They compare it to the original trilogy and the score suffers 

[11:59] <darkciders> @dukaduka another season of Wolf Among us would put them back on top OpieOP 
[11:59] <bethelewd> jim first is salty friday with okami 
[11:59] <paddingtonbearl87> and NEW COOKIES 
[11:59] <paddingtonbearl87> yum

[12:00] <astrojetboy> Its FINN 
[12:00] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> pubg will win

[12:00] <darkvikingl59> pubg will win 

[12:00] <theycallmejimbob> Popsicolo could you do different pepe versions of dspPepe or would it be a lot of 
trouble dspHmm 

[12:00] <dukaduka> @Darkciders yeah it's about 2 years too late for that OpieOP just look at how far the 
Walking Dead has fallen 

[12:00] <pcgamehunter> @Kekon3 Yeah I've got no one to go with, so I'd be watching it at home anyway :P 
[12:00] <glitch_crazed> PUBG is so gonna win 

[12:00] <bionich00t> Viewers hate Last Jedi because it's made by and for cucks. Which is a small minority of 
the audience, but majority of the critics. So it's the new Citizen Kane so brave for critics but shit for fans/normal 
people. 

[12:00] <vendatus> pubg always wins Kappa 

[12:00] <darkvikingl59> last time there were 865 people just for pubg xD

[12:05] <glitch_crazed> @vendatus not YTers. Square Enix is releasing it a day early 

[12:05] <pcgamehunter> The thing I hate about Before the Storm is because it's a prequel that came out before 
the original. The game gives me t he option to play reponsible [not annoying] Chloe, but then forces me to act 
stupid anyway :/ 

[12:05] <little_blake> yes do it 

[12:05] <little_blake> do monster hunter

[13:19] <zahvone> @londorgael They used a filter of blur to offset the color scheme. For some reason a lot of 
PS2 games do this.

[14:38] <madibased> i hope phil gets salty at this game lul 
[14:38] <pcgamehunter> Jimbob LUL

[14:38] <theycallmejimbob> don’t think he’ll be playing this for much longer madibased 
[14:38] <madibased> lol you guys said opposite stuff 
[14:39] <encelor> salt? 

[14:39] <theycalhnejimbob> :D I never would of guessed that about you zahvone tbh 

[14:39] <pcgamehunter> As the P4 intro plays on the emulator it reminds me that theres now a fairly well 

working PS3 emulator 

[14:39] <kekon3> I'm expecting Okami to get put off too tbh. 

[14:39] <jbowler21> he’ll probably quit at the big blossom tree part with the orange guy. it's annoying if you 
keep getting it wrong 



[14:39] <me_god> ... a ps3 emulator? oh. 

[14:39] <kekon3> gonna stay in the backlog mines forever, like Nier and Yakuza FeelsBadMan 

[14:39] <zahvone> @theycallmejimbob I enjoy happiness and all of that, and friendship and family - but I have a 

very negative outlook on life lol. Maybe I'm just normal, who knows! 

[14:40] <zahvone> Alright let me pitch you guys a game idea, okay 

[14:40] <pcgamehunter> You need some serious CPU to run things well, but it seems stable outside the framerate 
[14:40] <zahvone> You know this whole thing with EA fucking up star wars? 

[14:40] <me_god> ... uhhh 

[14:40] <zahvone> Disney should give the rights to FromSoftware. 

[14:40] <theycallmejimbob> damn Zahvone you're sounding like Cherdy now you haven’t been listening to 

Morrissey and Radiohead too

[14:41] <divanerasmus> hi @everyone is this Okami an RPG ? if so its a boring piece of sh@t i am guessing 
[14:41] <theycallmejimbob> no there isn’t though I remember one of my friends had their greatest hits on repeat 
for 6 months in his car dspPepe Zahvone 
[14:42] <encelor> okami is like a 3d zelda game 

[14:42] <me_god> also, I don’t remember that many ps3 classics people might want to come back to 

[14:42] <noodleguyl 1> kid a best album 

[14:42] <theycallmejimbob> the guys doing the wii u emulator are making serious money on patreon from it 

[14:42] <me_god> ps2 needed an emulator. ps3 not really. 

[14:42] <encelor> ps2 already has a emulator 

[14:42] <me_god> yeah the wii u is more exclusives that multiplats. but ps3 is kinda the opposite.

[14:48] <insolar> So is this guy autistic or am I just not getting the joke 

[14:48] <kekon3> gonna give a big boost at the end of the year, saving up to get a gift for a friend 
[14:48] <theycallmejimbob> that's all you're gonna take away from this game PC :D 

[14:48] <me_god> @DarksydePhil wipeout omega collection VR is TBA but coming soon. 

[14:48] <kingofhypocrisy> Phil never gets good views on these long japanese games 
[14:48] <pcgamehunter> @theycallmejimbob I might play it on PC if the port is any good :D 
[14:48] <wxrxaxtxh> @KingOfHypocrisy its a niche 
[14:48] <pcgamehunter> Or just emulate the Wii version 
[14:49] <kingofhypocrisy> @WxRxAxTxH nothing he can do 

[14:49] <kekon3> It's more than it being a japanese game, no one really played okami, even in the old days 
[14:49] <theycallmejimbob> seems to be well received on steam PC dspHnim though it's locked to 30fps if that 
matters to you 

[14:49] <encelor> just play e sport games LUL

wacom display tablet so i can use a real pen to draw :D 

[14:49] <kekon3> (It’s kind of why I'm surprised Phil is playing it) 

[14:49] <coralguy> @Kekon3 very well put agreed 
[14:50] <rx93gundamm> belch 

[14:50] <kekon3> Not upset phil is playing it, I like okami a lot, but surprised

[14:51] <pcgamehunter> @theycallmejimbob well the pen can work as a normal mouse cursor so I hope it 
doesn't lock out one control scheme, otherwise it should :) 

[14:51] <kekon3> We talking about slow chat, no one showing 

[14:51] <encelor> phil might ditch okami for its low attendants 

[14:51] <kushiyakitori> @jbowler21 324 it looks like

[16:54] <blk_mage_ctype> cheerlO Fun Fact: Those four-leaf clovers and the sound effect that plays when they 
sprout are references to Clover Studio, the developer who made Okami. Sadly, Capcom liquidated Clover Studio 
shortly after Okami’s release, but most of its workers including Okami's Director Hideki Kamiya went on to form 
Platinum Games of Bayonetta fame.

[16:59] <pinkdam> I guess people want phil to be mr. views 

[16:59] <dweebenheimer20> @ChairmanCaleb i dont mind 30fps on RPG's or games like that, but for action 
games i personally prefer 60 

[16:59] <chairmancaleb> @dweebenheimer20 Nothing wrong w/ that, it's certainly preferable. 

[17:00] <encelor> @couldntblawkdood not on twitch :D

[17:04] <pcgamehunter> tree* 

[17:04] <couldntblawkdood> I have a question, can a person be both a detractor and avid fan of phil? 

[17:04] <encelor> yeah 

[17:04] <encelor> i have met many 

[17:04] <pcgamehunter> yeah they're called Mort

[17:05] <cinochino> Slash the branch not the fruit stupid 

[17:05] <chairmancaleb> @couldntblawkdood I believe you can critique things that are fair and still be fair to 
him, sure. I mean, that goes for any human being on planet Earth though. Everyone will have falws. 

[17:05] <chairmancaleb> flaws* 

[17:05] <pcgamehunter> That hat with the insect net 
[17:05] <jbowler21> it works the drawing is just picky. 

[17:05] <blk_mage_ctype> @DarksydePhil You have to slash the stem connecting the fruit to the tree, not the 
fruit itself. 

[17:05] <pcgamehunter> Also every time I write insect, I mistakenly write incest first OpieOP 
[17:05] <encelor> Succuya is a bitch dspAngrydsp 
[17:05] <encelor> LUL 

[17:06] <couldntblawkdood> @chairmancaleb oh ok that makes sense but are those people still considered 
detractors? 



[17:06] <aspymachine> Hi everyone 

[17:06] <pcgamehunter> got here for the end aspy 

[17:06] <chairmancaleb> @couldntblawkdood No, the detractors are the ones who are rabid haters of Phil and 
will still come to his streams and social media to insult him. 

[17:06] <pinkdam> why are people having this conversation with someone with the user name 
couldntblawkdood.... 

[17:06] <sidella434> awwww no okami5Y~” 

[17:06] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe time flies by 
[17:06] <arcticsurface> That was awesome. <3 

[17:06] <psychicandice> You may want to just come clean about the whole girlfriend situation, Phil. It will save 

you a lot of stress and harassment towards her and yourself in the long run. Blocking her on Twitter wona€™t do 

anything. Youa€™re just digging yourself a bigger hole. Just pay Kim her hard earned money and all of this will 

go away.#ebegger #charity #patronsforpaidpussy
