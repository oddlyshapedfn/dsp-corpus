[11:38] <vendatus> the timing LUL 

[11:38] <zahvone> @ThatAnonyBear I'm thinking about picking up UFC 3 but, 
apparently it's even worse with microtransactions and lootboxes than 
Battlefront was 

[11:38] <orionrogue> oh my I've missed this remix 
[11:38] <zahvone> and volume 

[11:38] <takumibun> heavy is the rain Kreygasm 
[11:38] <zahvone> This has to be the best remix lol. 

[11:38] <thatanonybear> @Zahvone UFC 2 is basically just as bad, it's 
mostly pay to win 
[11:38] <sidella434> Yes 

[11:38] <rx93gundamm> you speled i spawn i die wrong 
[11:39] <bethelewd> no the best remix is the sonic one 
[11:39] <jii_el> im dying 

[11:39] <retrocerverus> true fact, I used phil's heavy rain line for a 
novel of mine, but changed rain with darkness. 

[11:39] <bethelewd> then back in time 
[11:39] <jii_el> i forgot about this 

[11:39] <zahvone> @ThatAnonyBear Well, I mean in UFC 3 apparently you pay 
for things like basic punches. 

[11:39] <orionrogue> I really like "I spawn, I die!" too 

[11:39] <glitch_crazed> You should put songs like Rudolph and Santa Claus 
is coming to town in prestream Sdarksydephil just an extra touch for 
Christmas 

[11:39] <zahvone> Though I'm not entirely sure about that. 

[11:39] <bethelewd> and 3rd is this

[12:05] <zahvone> @Azotherian Ah, of course. I should have realized that. 
What's the goal of your app? 

[12:05] <azotherian> @Zahvone and it has to be on an ios device to test,

the entire row of data to the app 

[12:07] <ewojo> check out Holiday Inn Phil 



[12:07] <zahvone> @Azotherian I'm not hugely into JSON and server tech, 
sadly. I really should get into it, very important stuff. 

[12:07] <bethelewd> course vidar loves bad santa 

[12:07] <thatanonybear> you could always watch the 2 hour Hulu version of

[12:08] <zahvone> @Azotherian Do you enjoy it, though? 

[12:08] <griffinbox> cheer50 Whenever you resume a game after a long 
hiatus, would you consider watching the last video you uploaded live 
during pre stream? I think its a good benefit as it helps you remember 
where you left off and I guess it is also considered as a reaction video 
that everyone has been asking for. 

[12:08] <rx93gundamm> not if i swallow the tiny toy inside!

to a different packet, so HA! 

[12:09] <retrocerverus> They watch you because they're closet fans of 
yours. There's no other reason why they would be here or interact with 
you.

[12:11] <zahvone> @Azotherian Well, I know Python is slightly more 
forgiving than C++, and that C++ is incredibly strict. I'm hoping that it 
will promote better structure for me so I'm less prone to making silly 
mistakes

[12:16] <zahvone> @Azotherian I'm not exactly sure what I want to do. I 
feel like back-end is a lot better as far as money making opportunities 
go. Though really I just want to get into it for the creative aspect. 
Structured code is like sex for my eyes. Cringy, I know. But it's true.

[12:17] <tourwithme> Rich viewers usually always watch the top twitch 
streamers like Soda or Dr. Disrespect and give them thousands even though 
they are millionaires 

[12:17] <aproxymate> @moniqueiv how come you aren't a mod yet 
[12:17] <thatanonybear> ah-brao 

[12:17] <tm52twitch> @DarksydePhil That is very mature take upon your 
situation. 

[12:17] <zahvone> @DarksydePhil You should do a patreon only giveaway 
each month with your merch. 

[12:17] <azotherian> @Zahvone structured code is good, but hard to really 
get, especially with multiple people working one one team

[12:18] <tourwithme> Yeah, I said usually so its not 100% true dude 
[12:18] <zahvone> @Azotherian Well I think I'd probably like to start off 
working solo. Maybe doing smaller things like short games (using unreal 
engine) and less application development. I realize however that it's not 
simple. 

[12:18] <aragorio> I love how people judge him for trying to make money 
when he outright says that he is trying to make money to keep his house. 
Like its some kind of secret 

[12:18] <vendatus> Well Dr. Disrespect has an entertaining gimmick LUL 
[12:18] <zahvone> @Azotherian I also think modding would be fun. 

[12:18] <princegl03> I was Phil's biggest fan about 6 years ago when he 
used to unbox all the new games and play them I relied on his release day

[14:42] <aes0411> cheerlO I like the new Patreon goal, but why are you 
considering a playthrough of what many would consider as the black sheep 
of the MGS series (a.k.a. MGS 2)? 

[14:42] * thatanonyraccoon sends "drunkonthebathroomfloor" to the moon 

[14:42] <kekon3> @aes0411 MGS2 is awesome 
[14:42] <kekon3> best oone 

[14:43] <aes0411> @Kekon3 Best one? Come on now.... 

[14:43] <jonathan_snow> Because we want to see Flipping naked White guy 
@aes0411 

[14:43] <kekon3> Don't @ ME BabyRage 

[14:43] <aes0411> @Jonathan_Snow That makes more sense than Kekon's 
statement lo 

[14:43] <kozatof> @aes0411 but thr best one is mgsv 
[14:43] <jonathan_snow> LUL 

[14:43] <drunkonthebathroomfloor> u didnt push x coon BibleThump 
[14:43] <aes0411> @Kekon3 Better than 3? Better than 4? Better than 5? 

Sir. . . . 

[14:43] <theycallmejimbob> kekon VoHiYo 

[14:43] <kekon3> @kozatof this is a banable offense Kappa 
[14:43] <kozatof> Feelsawfulman 

[14:43] <thatanonyraccoon> Kekon, go play Tekken 
[14:43] <aes0411> @kozatof MGS 5 is good. I personally prefer 3 
[14:44] <kekon3> 4 is okay, 5 is just a remake of Peace Walker so you 
don't have to play Peace Walker 

[14:44] <paddingtonbearl87> HAHAHAHHhahhahahahahGhahhahahagagagagh 
InuyoFace InuyoFace InuyoFace InuyoFace 
[14:44] <darkershin> what a laugh indeed 
[14:44] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[14:44] <thatanonyraccoon> i love the cadence of DSP's laugh 
[14:44] <kekon3> 3 is cool but radically different. MGS2 still has the 
MGSl/Twin Snakes system 





[14:44] <aes0411> @Kekon3 If it was a remake of Peace Walker, then they 
would have the same story. They don't You are either trolling or talking 
out of your ass :) 

[14:45] <drunkonthebathroomfloor> Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale 

Series is a mario like 

[14:45] <drunkonthebathroomfloor> :) 

[14:45] <kekon3> Lol, but why would you even play Peace Walker after MGSV 
happens? for the story? just cutscene it 

[14:45] <kekon3> Then just play MGSV for the good version of PeaceWalker 
gameplay 

[14:46] <hands_celebratory> woooo 

[14:46] <kekon3> MGSV does so good with the Peace Walker Formula, it's 
impressive 

[14:46] <aes0411> @Kekon3 Why would you play any MGS? You play to 
experience the gameplay and the story at the same time. Yes, MGS5 has a 
lot of grinding, but it is still a decent game. The only questionable 
part about it was the extra chapter that felt woefully shoe-horned in 
there 

[14:47] <hands_celebratory> LUL 

[14:47] <kekon3> You mean the extra bit in Peace Walker? 

[14:47] <kozatof> Song is garbage 
[14:47] <kekon3> with Paz? 

[14:47] <nazzrax> WHY AM I TOXIC 
[14:47] <kozatof> Rambo! 

[14:47] <kekon3> don't remind me, I did that whole thing FeelsBadMan 
[14:47] <divanerasmus> This is For my Chanel Bitch 

[14:47] <aes0411> @Kekon3 It wouldn't be that bad if you didn't need to 
re-play certain missions 

[14:48] <verykorean> When oes the stream star? 

[14:48] <kozatof> Never 

[14:48] <somonel92> this is for what now 

[14:49] <paddingtonbearl87> CHINKY CHANG CHAWNG CrreamAwk MingLee MingLee 
[14:49] <kekon3> but yeah, I put the story in Peace Walker over MGS3 
actually, mostly cause of the execution on the peace walker itself and 
the mission lead up 

[14:49] <kekon3> MGS3 was best in gameplay but I'm only warm on it's 
story 

[14:49] <hands_celebratory> nfs next? 

[14:49] <kekon3> and MGSV story just kinda made me sad cause of the 
obvious reasons 

[14:50] <kekon3> Then again, played Peace Walker on PSP, that control

[16:03] <the_elusiveone45> I want an actual GOTG video-game, not this 
crap. 

[16:03] <aragorio> Making a game so it can be ported to mobile is not a 
defense
