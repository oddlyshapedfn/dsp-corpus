[16:58] <hands_celebratory> think i saw this movie on lifetime 
[16:58] <rx93gundamm> it was a katana 
[16:58] <iradiumviking> this story is really bad. 

[16:58] <hastur01> I just started watching 



[16:58] <vendatus> She wouldn't die anyway she’d just lose the arm Kappa 
[16:58] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> TriHard TriHard 
[16:58] <hastur01> after the cutting scene 

[16:59] <pcgamehunter> @Vendatus Nah she wouldn’t be nice enough for Jefferson to photo after that Kappa 
[16:59] <eddievaderl986> i dont get these type of games. Just a watch a movie instead 

[16:59] <solid_fantasy> Even though it's terrible some people might not want spoilers and just want to watch it 
here @pcgamehunter 

[16:59] <monkeydonkeyape> why does every character talk so slow? 

[16:59] <rx93gundamm> so the brain dead fans can understand 
[16:59] <manchestertan> this is the sequel to chrono trigger? 

[16:59] <iradiumviking> to be awkward obviously 
[16:59] <sirnoblex> no 

[16:59] <vendatus> pc pis he would touch her nub LUL 
[17:00] <sirnoblex> She called "Rachel"

[17:00] <pcgamehunter> @solid_fantasy Watching a playthrough of something not wanting spoilers dspHmm ?

psychological help.

[17:21] <thatanonyraccoon> just fucking say it 
[17:22] <iradiumviking> this is like listening to a song at 1/8 speed. 

[17:22] <solid_fantasy> I don’t mind this genre or more games like it, but they need quality writing 

[17:22] <jetset3000> what a fuckin sissy guy 

[17:22] <thatanonyraccoon> deep dicked by a hot dog doll

[17:22] <dukaduka> @pcgamehunter i just finished the game and I get what you were saying yesterday LUL 
[17:22] <i_came_here_to_something> Been like almost 4 minutes of no interactive gameplay 
[17:22] <pcgamehunter> @dukaduka yup OpieOP 

[17:23] <hastur01> this "genre" existed in the 90’s, but it actually had gameplay in the form of puzzles and 
interactive objects 

[17:23] <fluttershyl970> just like willam shatner 
[17:23] <poryon2> Minecraft stream WHEN? 

[17:23] <pureo_nikku> the Samoa Joe promo style "I'm gonna talk real quietly AND THEN SCREAM" 

[17:23] <hastur01> this is like the old point click adventures minus all of the gameplay elements 

[17:23] <jetset3000> they are on valium 

[17:23] <thynameisbren> I need an adult WutFace 

[17:23] <thatanonyraccoon> some PS2 games had cutscenes 2 hours long in the middle ofthe game, but at least 
you could PLAY a GAME between them 

[17:23] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> a game crash would be more entertaining 
[17:23] <litterial> Slower than Bald Marky Mark in slow-mo 



[17:23] <fallen_one_gaming> voice acting directed by William Shatner lol @darksydephil

[17:23] <i_came_here_to_something> @Hastur01 Exactly. Beneath a Steel Sky, Blade Runner, even 
Phantasmagoria 1 and 2 had actual gameplay to them. And more interesting stories too. 

[17:23] <pcgamehunter> Kappa 

[17:23] <hastur01> it's possible to make point click adventure games that are really good

[17:25] <pcgamehunter> The problem for me here was that after learning he wasn't a cheater and how he handles 
the part with Rachel there is no reason to hate her dad really. But they just go back to hating him like this part is 
written separatly NotLikeThis

[17:30] <encephalolz> No surprise Kappa 

[17:31] <thatanonyraccoon> @I_Came_Here_To_Something tbf I love the sequel, Spoony did a phenomenal 
playthrough of it 

[17:31] <hastur01> both phantasmagorias were, at least, interesting

[17:31] <pureo_nikku> I think Phil is part of the Yep! movement Kappa 
[17:31] <hastur01> especially compared to this garbage

[17:32] <i_came_here_to_something> @ThatAnonyRaccoon Agreed. The gay char was pretty interesting too. 
Prob the best written char in the game tbh. I just don’t care for the "twist" at the end or that final puzzle before the 
ending. 

[17:32] <thatanonyraccoon> i only ever saw Spoony play Phantasmagoria 2, but I loved it 
[17:32] <bos2161> Because you've watched the Big Bang Theory 
[17:32] <pcgamehunter> Glove ... just pick the fucking glove already ... 

[17:32] <iradiumviking> I didn’t know who spooney was before i watched that TGWTG documentary from jim

[17:34] <thatanonyraccoon> yeah, just for the hell of it, no other reason 

[17:34] <dukaduka> @britishgamingblack this game has supernatural stuff too right? But it’s got the cheating, 
drug use, teen drama, etc 

[17:34] <londorgael> cmon fam you looked at chat lol 
[17:34] <thatanonyraccoon> he guessed, he really did 
[17:34] <thatanonyraccoon> TALENT PREVAILS

[17:34] <altlefttalk> He guessed, my ass 

[17:34] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @WxRxAxTxH afk most of the time, watched the last hour or so

[17:34] <elipsion> @DarksydePhil Burn it in the forest 

[17:34] <i_came_here_to_something> You should try it sometime off GOG. @ThatAnonyRaccoon It's like $6 
normally but sometimes it's on sale. The last puzzle was inventive but you had to use a strategy guide to solve it.

[17:35] <manchestertan> its not black and white. 

[17:35] <thatanonyraccoon> @I_Came_Here_To_Something you needed a strategy guide to comprehend the 
damn puzzle loool, but I might rewatch the Spoony playthrough instead :P Yahtzee Croshaw did a lett's play for 
it too 

[17:35] <skooma_dealer> #buyanewgame 

[17:35] <thatanonyraccoon> fun game to watch others play, but not fun to play itself

[17:37] <pcgamehunter> Heavy Rain and Phoenix Wright are my favs SeemsGood 

[17:37] <dukaduka> @iradiumviking phil's narrative game playthroughs are some of his best, when he actually 
enjoys the game OpieOP 

[17:37] <i_came_here_to_something> Those playthroughs really got a lot of WTFs from people 
@ThatAnonyRaccoon the game’s that crazy but yeah, more fun to watch than play. Playing it at night w/ 
headphones helped a lot at least, and the story's genuinely interesting. But it's not a particularly hard adventurer 
or large in scope. Prob not missing much if you decide to watch rather than play it. 

[17:37] <majorkyon> !uptime command got removed? Jebaited 
[17:37] <hastur01> his let's plays of the FMV games are good

[17:47] <encephalolz> "The best way to protect you is to end your life" Jebaited 

[17:47] <londorgael> wow so badass 

[17:47] <reggiejay> LUL 

[17:47] <hastur01> wow 

[17:47] <rebelxcel> This game is horrible. 

[17:47] <bos2161> There's no failing in this game. The concept of failing is just a tool of the white male 
patriarchy made to oppress females and minorities. 

[17:47] <hastur01> this game is dog doo doo 
[17:47] <solid_fantasy> Rape averted 

[17:47] <dukaduka> this is a prequel, so does any of this matter OpieOP 
[17:47] <thatanonyraccoon> it's a glorified cutscene 

[17:47] <pcgamehunter> Wait what... ? He literally barged through a LOCKED door LUL 

[17:47] <brucelegend> 6.5 / 10 ign 

[17:47] <bomb980> that was awful my gosh 

[17:48] <wxrxaxtxh> chloe's butthole still in tact, mission completed 

[17:48] <pcgamehunter> @DarksydePhil I fucking reloaded to get it right... wish i figured that out sooner 
NotLikeThis 

[17:48] <manchestertan> fuck the whole thing 

[17:48] <dukaduka> these are games which don't effect real life, so why even play games OpieOP 
[17:48] <londorgael> GOTY 

[17:48] <encephalolz> Molestation averted. SUCCESS OpieOP 
[17:48] <thatanonyraccoon> what a jackass 
[17:48] <hastur01> it's the engine filled with bees 
[17:48] <thatanonyraccoon> she droe herself off the road 

[17:48] <borisstingy> One of the most painfully boring games I have ever witnessed. 

[17:48] <sirnoblex> HAHAHAHAH 

[17:48] <pcgamehunter> Remember when Life is Strange claimed it's choices mattered OpieOP 
[17:48] <eclonic> textures look like PUBG too cheerlO 
[17:48] <pcgamehunter> Yeah more bullshit 

[17:48] <dukaduka> she was driving in the middle of road, she's trying to end up like her dad NotLikeThis 

[17:48] <bos2161> GOTY is between this or PUBG 

[17:48] <solid_fantasy> They used the same graphics too 

[17:48] <thatanonyraccoon> writing in PUBG is better 

[17:49] <solid_fantasy> no, Payback is GOTY 

[17:49] <pcgamehunter> Except Life is strange existed before PUBG dspHmm 



[17:49] <dukaduka> that's tuff 
[17:49] <brucelegend> monkaS 

[17:49] <rebelxcel> This and the first game got great ratings. How?! 

[17:49] <theycallmejimbob> what are you guys on about this game is hella good real edge of your seat stuff 
dspHmm 

[17:49] <thatanonyraccoon> this isn't how schizophrenia works 
[17:49] <hastur01> these devs have a lot of daddy problems 

[17:49] <pcgamehunter> @theycallmejimbob Edge of a razor blade more like Kappa 

[17:49] <londorgael> whoever suggested this needs to be talked to 

[17:49] <thatanonyraccoon> Senua is more representative 

[17:49] <encephalolz> Or maybe her dad is just a Force Ghost? Kappa 

[17:49] <pcgamehunter> Or a edge of a roof Keepo 

[17:49] <theycallmejimbob> PC dspShock 

[17:49] <rebelxcel> 10/10 Voice Acting, Animation and Facial Animations. 

[17:49] <pcgamehunter> Mirrors edge is better than this Kappa 
[17:49] <fluttershyl970> her father is a force ghost 
[17:50] <rebelxcel> 100/10 Dialogue. 

[17:50] <pcgamehunter> Still better animation than Andromeda Kappa 

[17:50] <londorgael> 1000/10 voice acting 

[17:50] <miff_dasboot> MUMBO JUMBO BULLSHIT CHLOE 

[17:50] <i_came_here_to_something> @RebelXceL "Games as art" idiots. Nevermind the endless SNES, 
Genesis, PS1, PS2 etc games infinitely more artistic and interesting in a gameplay POV 
[17:50] <nightbot> Miff dasboot -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[17:50] <londorgael> like paint drying 
[17:50] <borisstingy> Gameplay 10000/10 

[17:50] <sleepyfollower> Let all the loved characters die if you can. 

[17:50] <hastur01> muh art 

[17:50] <miff_dasboot> Mumbo jumbo bullshit game 
[17:50] <thatanonyraccoon> this is trite 

[17:50] <dukaduka> So what the prequel confirmed is: Chloe is crazy, Rachel was nothing but trouble, and drugs 
are bad 

[17:50] <pcgamehunter> You can't hear the answer he's dead and you don’t know ... 

[17:50] <londorgael> how do people find this game fun 

[17:50] <londorgael> this game is work 

[17:50] <manchestertan> This uses the crytek engine?

[17:51] <dukaduka> good point dead dad LUL 

[17:51] <encephalolz> "No time to tell you what I dont have time to tell you." Kappa Kappa Kappa 

[17:51] <i_came_here_to_something> Even Pac-Man and Asteroids are more artistic and have actual game 

mechanics and structure to them 

[17:51] <sockafock> dspWowdude 

[17:51] <sleepyfollower> Smoke a cigarette to be cool. 

[17:51] <majorkyon> it's like a new level of bad voice acting 

[17:51] <hastur01> how long are all of the episodes of this combined 

[17:51] <thatanonyraccoon> at least Pac Man and Asteroids havelikable characters 

[17:51] <hastur01> like over 9 hours? 

[17:51] <manchestertan> 5 



[17:51] <madmoxxii> Doesnt she have somewhere to be? 

[17:51] <rebelxcel> What a fucking whining baby, fuck man. 

[17:51] <pcgamehunter> FYI they never actually address the part where jefferson kidnaps rachel ... the essential 
part...

[17:52] <fluttershyl970> she is mary sue 

[17:52] <i_came_here_to_something> I’d rather had been a dot eaten by Pac Man than be a char in this game. At 
least the dots serve a game mechanic purpose. 

[17:52] <patrickbl973> the 2 live youtube streams going on now right now are more fun then this game man. 
glad i didnt buy it
