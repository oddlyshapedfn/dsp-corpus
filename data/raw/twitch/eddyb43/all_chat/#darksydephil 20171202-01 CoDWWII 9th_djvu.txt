[11:43] <darksydephil> yes, thats right 
[11:43] <darksydephil> repeat that like a parrot 
[11:43] <darksydephil> proves how smart you are lol 
[11:43] <rx93gundamm> :D 

[11:43] <admiralprawn> I've never heard this music before, where did this 
come from, Phil? 

[11:43] <rx93gundamm> sorry dude I just think its funny 

[11:44] <darksydephil> i seriously wonder about people who mindlessly 

repeat shit 

[11:44] <6th_moral> like you repeat how you need more money every stream 
lmao 

[11:44] <darksydephil> like, do you constantly need napkins to wipe the 
drool off your mouth? lol 
[11:44] <rx93gundamm> sometimes 

[11:44] <rx93gundamm> every dsp tries it im drooling 

[11:44] <admiralprawn> Alright, let's not degenerate this chat, I'm 

having a good weekend and don't want any negativity. 

[11:44] <bethemadeagle> saw that coming 

[11:44] <sonicdude4567> hey you thinking of playing southpark yet? 

[11:44] <nich2440> what are you replying to phil? 

[11:44] <darksydephil> you do realize that mindlessly repeating 
meaningless memes shows low intelligence, right? 

[11:45] <rx93gundamm> oh 

[11:45] <stunted> welcome to twitch phil 

[11:45] <admiralprawn> Phil, it means they don't have the intelligence to 
come up with their own jokes. 

[11:45] <thenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil you keep getting baited by 
them 

[11:45] <thenewfaceofcreation> thats why they will do it 

[11:45] <admiralprawn> So they need to repeat what others have said. 

[11:45] <darksydephil> there's no bait here 

[11:45] <darksydephil> it's just an observation 

[11:45] <darksydephil> AdmiralPrawn is exactly right 

[11:45] <darksydephil> and the stuff they repeat doesn't even make sense 

[11:45] <bethefueg> I love how I come on and the first thing I see is 

phil berating someone :D 

[11:45] <friendly_gaming> ignore the haters phil 

[11:46] <darksydephil> they just repeat it to be part of something 

[11:46] <darksydephil> it's the epitome of being a mindless, drooling 

idiot 

[11:46] <kevingunn3r> hey everyone 



[11:46] <scoopula> people are idiots, they just want attention 
[11:46] <gamemaster2003isdead> phil you just need to rise above this 
[11:46] <admiralprawn> It wouldn't be so bad if they at least had the 
creativity to come up with their own shit, instead of just copying memes. 
[11:46] <nich2440> Are you really ranting about people posting memes? 
[11:46] <sonicdude4567> are you going to play south park or sonic forces 
yet? 

[11:46] <stunted> I mean people being dumb on the internet isn't exactly 
a new thing LUL 

[11:46] <darksydephil> no, this is about the dumb shit people repeat 

about me that makes no sense lol 

[11:46] <darksydephil> "i prefer a penne" huh? 

[11:46] <rx93gundamm> sonic i think he already played both and did full 
play throughs 

[11:46] <kushiyakitori> south park and sonic forces are both done 
[11:47] <nich2440> Who cares tho? 

[11:47] <darksydephil> you literally took something random i said on a 
prestream and turned it into a meaningless meme 
[11:47] <blue_blur64> he beat both a while ago sonicdude :P 
[11:47] <sonicdude4567> ok 

[11:47] <rx93gundamm> @DarksydePhil When you said that on stream weren't 
you talking about a noodle dish you ate? 

[11:47] <bethemadeagle> he has played south park and sonic forces and 
beat em both 

[11:47] <sonicdude4567> did he like forces 

[11:47] <darksydephil> im pretty sur ei was responding to a cheer 
[11:47] <rx93gundamm> oh 

[11:47] <darksydephil> like someone asked me if i had a preference of 
pasta 

[11:47] <admiralprawn> Best to just ignore them, if they don't have the 
intelligence to say anything original, then they aren't worth your energy 
or time. Likewise, if someone has nothing positive to say then don't say 
it. It's an amazingly simple and effective system. 

[11:47] <rx93gundamm> haha yeah it was cut to say i prefer a penne 
[11:47] <darksydephil> and i said i liked pasta that was easy to get with 
your fork be some of them are a pain in the ass and splash sauce 
[11:48] <thenewfaceofcreation> @AdmiralPrawn hope phil listens to what 
you said 

[11:48] kthenewfaceofcreation> cuz he doesnt 

[11:48] <darksydephil> so...how does that turn into a pointless meme? see 
what i'm saying, it's mindless 

[11:48] <stunted> they do it to piss you off phil 

[11:48] <kevingunn3r> This song though 

[11:48] <nich2440> Is it really that big of a deal? 

[11:48] <admiralprawn> People on the internet are assholes, it's an 
inescapable fact. 

[11:48] <friendly_gaming> they winning if you react to this 
[11:49] <thenewfaceofcreation> @friendly_gaming i guess? 

[11:49] <gautyer> I prefer a pene. 

[11:49] <nikiboo32_> are traps gay? 

[11:49] <admiralprawn> Hello, Phil!

[11:51] <thenewfaceofcreation> @AdmiralPrawn wau 

[11:51] <bethemadeagle> sonic cool 

[11:52] <rx93gundamm> If you check his twitter ww2 won so probably 
[11:53] <kevingunn3r> ww2 sucks 
[11:53] <kevingunn3r> in some ways 

[11:53] <admiralprawn> It was quite a destructive conflict, yes. 

[11:53] <sonicdude4567> it doesn't 

[11:53] <signori_> most ways Kappa 

[11:53] <trihard41iife> TriHard 

[11:53] <sonicdude4567> ww2 no more future yes 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> no more jetpack wallrunning bullshit :D 

[11:54] <gamemaster2003isdead> no 

[11:54] <nikiboo32_> phill are u a thicc trap? 

[11:54] <admiralprawn> I remember reading a youtube comment about someone 
complaining that you could pick up a Russian machine gun in the D-Day 
mission, when that's actually pretty historically accurate. The Wehrmacht 
captured thousands of Soviet weapons, rechambered them for German 
ammunition and then armed a lot of their troops on the western front with 
them since you know, shortage of materiel.

[11:58] <rockumentary> @Ibbi65 this is his job 

[11:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz maybe 

[11:59] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> LUL 



[11:59] <rx93gundamm> selling his house is admitting defeat for 
everything he worked hard for 

[11:59] <nikiboo32_> Taxation is theft anyone 

[11:59] <leonaras> To be fair Phil, you have some responsibility over 
your own taxes, you cant entirely blame the guy. Dont get me wrong he IS 
at fault, but the buisness tax info is fairly easy to research. 

[11:59] <nikiboo32_> taxes are evil goberment lies 

[11:59] <rx93gundamm> but he said he has no money to sue the guy 

@Leonaras

[12:50] <takumibun> bad joke? LUL 
[12:50] <supersruzz> Yes it is... 

[12:50] <kevingunn3r> Parts of this game shine while others fall flat on 
its face 

[12:50] <scoopula> It's time for Battlefront, swap streams lol 

[12:50] <spookywun> CTF is a competitive gametype for mlg 

[12:50] <wxrxaxtxh> CTF is played at tournaments dood 

[12:50] <g_legend> Maybe you should watch the kill cam and see what 

hapepend 

[12:50] <astrojetboy> He didn't hit him first 

[12:50] <butter_my_bread> MLG game modes are not TDM man lol 

[12:50] <theycallmejimbob> chat is gonna be sassy today BetheMadEagle :D 
[12:50] <ihav4gotn> 7 deaths LUL 

[12:50] <breath321> Because standard cod gameplay is only kills based, 
with random respawning it becomes really luck dependant and the skill is 
taken out, the CTF is there to add some depth 

[12:50] <kushiyakitori> probably the earliest in a session that he said 
"this game sucks" 

[12:50] <bethemadeagle> jim if this was how many deaths i would be 
winning right now 

[12:50] <stunted> You're shooting them in the legs Phil LUL 
[12:50] <nikiboo32_> Lag xd

objective based modes

[12:51] <breath321> Phil, how do you expect a balanced game when you're 
in your placements? Placements are meant to find your skill level to then 
place you against players of similar skill, why complain about balancing 
during placements 

[12:51] <stunted> Astrojetboy you have to learn to just laugh at it 
[12:51] <theycallmejimbob> kozatof for mod hype VoHiYo 
[12:51] <ashfordian2015> Laggy gameplay 

[12:51] <corey_2293> placement matches determine your skill and ranking. 

after this they should have you in the matches you need to be in

[13:07] <musclesforbones> rub cheetah blood on the bullets so they go 
faster, you will get more kills that way 

[13:07] <corey_2293> this gun reminds me of mw2s ACR. gun was basically a 
laser LUL 

[13:07] <breath321> @ZangBa He won't be able to keep up with what's

[13:09] <ningen_sama> I can explain hip fire. 

[13:09] <corey_2293> saying overwatch is dead LUL 
[13:09] <misterbear805> hip fire 

[13:09] <musclesforbones> you could always do an IRL stream where you 
build model rockets LUL 

[13:09] <butter_my_bread> Nobody plays on console and frankly never 

should, game's trash on console 

[13:09] <breath321> Why does Phil legit spouts things that are 
demonstrably wrong? Does Phil think his viewers don't have access to 
google? 

[13:09] <runki> OW is only dead on console 

[13:09] <kearrius52> Overwatch not fucking dead wtf????? 

[13:09] <theycallmejimbob> :o

[13:09] <bernielomax517> People still play OW Lol 

[13:09] <ipandoh> Overwatch is not dead on console either. 

[13:09] <oakslsapws> dsp is a salty bitch

[13:10] <theycallmejimbob> hey bernielomax517 o/ 

[13:10] <paddingtonbearl87> he jus cheered 

[13:10] <fffffasdfasdas> overwatch is not on steam FailFish 
[13:10] <jackwhite202> unlike these games 

[13:10] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Overwatch is the FPS in modern gaming era 
[13:10] <breath321> I forgot though 

[13:10] <majinboo3> overwatch is dead took me 10 minutes to find a match 
[13:10] <bethemadeagle> dspDeath = phil every couple secs Kappa 
[13:10] <kearrius52> Overwatch pro league comes out next year lol 
[13:10] <bernielomax517> Hey there @theycallmejimbob ! 

[13:10] <ipandoh> Took you 10 minutes 
[13:10] <ipandoh> must be dead right 

[13:10] <breath321> If DSP doesn't like something, or isn't interested in 
it, therefore NO ONE likes it, so yeah, in DPSs head it really is dead 
[13:10] <ipandoh> FailFish 

[13:10] <paddingtonbearl87> gets insulted for no reason, thats nice 
[13:10] <synapse_321> leg shot 





[13:10] <jackwhite202> blizzard games have a long life span 
[13:10] <bethebaby> Meh. I didn't like Overwatch. 

[13:10] <ashfordian2015> Didn't realise the BAR had a fitting for a 
bayonet 

[13:10] <paddingtonbearl87> mskkF 

[13:10] <goldencolts> i wish phil would use other guns BlessRNG 

[13:10] <oakslsapws> every death is the games fault 

[13:10] <jackwhite202> take starcraft 1 for example 

[13:10] <ipandoh> but again 

[13:10] <bethemadeagle> LUL 

[13:11] <ipandoh> if Phil says it's dead 

[13:11] <majinboo3> League of legends is also dead to right phil??? 
[13:11] <ipandoh> it's 100% true 

[13:11] <bethebaby> @ashfordian2015 Duct tape Kappa 

[13:11] <breath321> @jackwhite202 Yeah fuckin SCI, Brood War and SC2 are 

still alive, and Phil thinks OW died 

[13:11] <theycallmejimbob> no dspsigh emote dspPepe 

[13:11] <pinkdam> yeah dota 2 killed it 

[13:11] <jackwhite202> the game is almost 20 years old and still has a 
big playerbase 

[13:11] <captainkirk221> does kdr matter? 

[13:11] <kevingunn3r> You should play rocket league again 
[13:11] <majinboo3> Literally nobody plays DOTA 2 

[13:11] kbutter_my_bread> Yep OW 70% PC and it's still popular on that 

platform. 

[13:11] <breath321> @captainkirk221 He's playing casual matches, nothing 
really matters 

[13:11] <musclesforbones> I play DOTA 2 :( 

[13:11] <majinboo3> i tried to find a match in DOTA 2 with my friend it 

took 1 HOUR to load a match 

[13:11] <lunezy> But again I digest. 

[13:11] <rotoch4mp> games are overall dead, reality is the new trend 
[13:11] <musclesforbones> LUL JK 

[13:11] <jackwhite202> @Breath321 even frickin Diablo II has a playerbase 
[13:11] <paddingtonbearl87> i swear the enemy team is full of bots 
[13:11] <oakslsapws> what will be his excuse the next time he dies 
[13:11] <paddingtonbearl87> LUL 
[13:12] <kushiyakitori> HUUUH?! 

[13:12] ktheycallmejimbob> rollback netcode dspPepe 
[13:12] <oakslsapws> ah more connection salt 
[13:12] <radicalenzyme> LUL 

[13:12] <kevingunn3r> 3 years to work on this game and this is what we 
get 

[13:12] <bethemadeagle> DBstyle x PipeHype 
[13:12] <butter_my_bread> Um... Uh.. 

[13:12] <breath321> @jackwhite202 Yeah if Phil isn't playing something, 
to him it's dead to everyone, does he think people are gullible enough to 
believe that shit? 

[13:12] <scoopula> This game's connections are horrible, shoots a guy 5 
times no hit markers 

[13:12] <big_dik_mikel> bruh he's lag switchin TriHard 7 

[13:12] <fffffasdfasdas> Overwatch and Rainbow Six are very active even 

on consoles because they still get content 



[13:12] <djrunol> the thing that bugs me is: we can all agree that the 
game is not great, but phils reasons why the game is garbage aare just 
plain stupid 

[13:12] <snarfu99> Wouldn't you get host-state-rewind when your 
connection is terrible? It shouldn't matter unless it's extremely laggy. 
[13:12] <oakslsapws> lucky kill by dsp 
[13:12] <breath321> @DJRunol Agreed actually 

[13:12] <bethebaby> @DJRunol I think the game's pretty good. At least, I 
enjoy playing it. 

[13:12] <theycallmejimbob> :( BetheMadEagle I miss the cherd too 
[13:12] <jackwhite202> @Breath321 while overwatch doesnt have nearly as 
many players now as it did at launch the game is still alive 
[13:13] <paddingtonbearl87> enemy team/bots are really bad 
[13:13] <bethemadeagle> jim :( 

[13:13] <oakslsapws> im going to now say that every kill by dsp is a 
lucky bullshit kill 
[13:13] <bethebaby> BBQ 

[13:13] <majinboo3> well the game that isnt dead is Street fighter 2 
turbo 

[13:13] <kushiyakitori> you hit him first and he hit you worse 
[13:13] <oakslsapws> shotgun is better 

[13:13] <majinboo3> still the most active fighting game right guys? 
[13:13] <breath321> Doesn't matter if you hit him first, he hit you in 
the head, do you know how damage works, or how FPSs work? 

[13:13] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil stop with the hip fire son. 

[13:13] <butter_my_bread> shotguns should be respected up close tho 

dood 

[13:13] <snarfu99> How would you know if you hit him first when there's 
significant lag? You wouldn't see him fire only after ~200ms 
[13:13] <rotoch4mp> the more players a game has the more stupid it gets 
[13:13] <ningen_sama> Play Street fighter Cod is lame 

[13:13] <paddingtonbearl87> u were gonna say u got shot thru a wall LUL 
[13:13] <oakslsapws> he flanked you. its a legit kill 

[13:14] <zangba> on a scale from 1 to Super Mario Sunshine, how dead is 
Overwatch? 

[13:14] <oakslsapws> lucky kill by dsp 

[13:14] <breath321> Soakslsapws Nah flanking and camping is cheating 
according to DSP 

[13:14] <shousan> this game is goat

[13:19] <lightsydejohn6> @divanerasmus Um, hello 
[13:19] <bethebaby> Almost a three-feed. 

[13:19] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil Vermintide is a Warhammer 
game similar to left 4 dead, but with rat people instead of zombies. 
[13:19] <oakslsapws> you can tell he loves his so called "job" 

[13:20] <bethemadeagle> phil will lose this round jim dspAngrydsp 



[13:20] <musclesforbones> If I recall correctly phil said in an interview 
for MTV that he prefers magic the gathering over hearthstone 
[13:20] <originalgraffe> The guns in this game have terrible fire rates 
and recoil 

[13:20] <darkvikingl59> doom vfr was released on 1 december 2017 
[13:20] <goldencolts> Sbethebaby thats too bad. he should do a pistol 
round or something 
[13:20] <divanerasmus> hello

[13:20] <vendatus> garbage yet still plays so must be good garbage

[13:21] <bethemadeagle> ven its salty Saturday tho 
[13:21] <nukacolaking> later guys, gotta go

his fault 

[13:21] <vendatus> expecting good games in 2017 LUL

[14:07] <pinkdam> just remember it was britain that stopped the hun in 
the west then russia in the east, america was just a supporting player in 
the fight against the nazis 

[14:07] <shillaryclintoon> @KushiYakitori why? 

[14:07] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @majinboo3 so that's why Russia has the

[15:02] <windblade72> it's the fact that there is no innovation with each

[15:02] <djrunol> how much you wanna bet phil was "technically" a lot 
better than everyone else 

[15:02] <blue_chopper> @AxiomSci LUL its true, i played cod most when i

driving mechanics or anything

server performance, Sledgehammer said. In response to this. Sledgehammer 
dropped the dedicated servers and switched to a P2P setup. This has 
helped improve things, but a P2P setup means players may experience host 
migration and other annoying little things.
