[13:06] <lastkryptonian94> @darksydephil Actually, no, what Nintendo does with videos of their games is not 
illegal. There’s no actual legal precedent for it because no one has taken a game developer to court over copyright 
claims.

[13:07] <brahski20> Who tf is mugsy? 

[13:07] <chairmancaleb> @LastKryptonian94 Also, Japan’s laws work completely differently, so "Fair Use" isn't 
global. YouTube even has their section explaining this. 

[13:07] <alexharveyconrad> @nasklaf What were you saying? It got deleted instantly... 

[13:07] <theycallmejimbob> Bobbi isn't even here :D

[13:15] <bethemadeagle> jim rip delta :( 

[13:15] <elipsion> NEIN 

[13:15] <convertedclone> Because if the senate seats switch around too much we’ll get Trumpcare and trump's 
Tax Plan 

[13:16] <theycallmejimbob> :o 

[13:16] <kushiyakitori> Senate seats done matter? ... 

[13:16] <nasklaf> @darksydephil people are talking about it because it's the senate. It's important for a lot of 
reasons. 

[13:16] <chairmancaleb> @ConvertedClone Good LUL 

[13:16] <epicun> Wrong phil, this determines the senate and the direction of the country 
[13:16] <dantemustdiee> @QWERTY6914 LUL get ur answer? 

[13:16] <theycallmejimbob> no BetheMadEagle really :( ? 

[13:16] <deepdrive3254> people are talking about it since they're in an election 
[13:16] <supernintendopower> DSP! 

[13:16] <lastkryptonian94> Ye Phil, senators totally have no effect on the country as a whole. 



[13:16] <bethemadeagle> jim i dont know who did it 
[13:16] <darkershin> $30? 

[13:16] <gamemaster2003isdead> dps for 2020 

[13:16] <10maj> Phil have considered becoming really good at just one game and streaming that? Overwatch for 
example 

[13:16] <aisaidhello> Couldn’t you review the movie? 

[13:16] <eggandcheese4> Why does this dude only talk about his bills and money? 

[13:16] <darkwolfpuppy> @aisaidhello it is, but think about it like this, a movie lasts 2 hours. But a game lasts 
10,20 or 100+ hours. 

[13:16] <kinggoken> Going to the movies is super expensive yo 

[13:16] <convertedclone> A senator is one of the most important positions in the country... 

[13:16] <gamemaster2003isdead> I hate you auto correct 

[13:16] <kinggoken> I bought a large popcorn and a hotdog and that was like 20 bucks, no joke 
[13:16] <supernintendopower> I'm going to see Casablanca in theaters tonight.

[13:42] <hardybuck4> @neospartanhesperos9 a producer means nothing. He looked at it for 1 day. 

[13:43] <korewasugoi> shnack

ago coming in at 1 hr 9 min 

[13:43] <alexharveyconrad> Full moon. Kappa 

[13:44] <solid_fantasy> The RT score for Justice League was 48% but we can't see it now and the score likely

[13:44] <hardybuck4> 48% still an improvement. 

[13:45] <deepdrive3254> how does an eagle wear pants in the first place? 

[13:45] <neospartanhesperos9> @HardyBuck4 I don't know how valid that statement is, but since a producer has 
a variety of roles like script writing, coordinating writing and editing, i'm sure he had some influence on the 
movie that made it better than anything Snyder would've made without him. 

[13:45] <bethemadeagle> deep they are very very small and title 
[13:45] <bobbi_Jing> hes only an eagle from the neck up

[15:44] <neospartanhesperos9> Nintendo is quality over quantity, they're not going to spam games like COD 
devs do, and i’m glad they don’t. 

[15:44] <bethemadeagle> nintendo go by if it isnt broke dont fix it motto 
[15:44] <alexharveyconrad> Amen to that. 

[15:44] <tr9000> I wonder if those hammer things are related to thwomps or whomps 
[15:44] <bethemadeagle> vidar bowser kingdom is bowsers creation he created this place 
[15:45] <bobbi_ling> mika kingdom 

[15:45] <bethemadeagle> dont know why is asian but maybe bowser is part asian 

[15:45] <ihav4gotn> since ultra sun and moon last pokemon game on the 3ds, when the release the one for 
switch its going to be Kreygasm 

[15:45] <bentboxer> eddie guerrero probably didnt get enough protein after working out so much everyday

workout 

[15:46] <aisaidhello> Hey @darksydephil any games you're excited for coming out?

[15:47] <bobbi_ling> your beloved seth is on roids beth

[15:51] <bobbi_ling> [twitter 

[15:51] <nightbot> Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycalhnedsp 
[15:51] <bethemadeagle> last time Stephanie did pedigree was on brie bella 
[15:51] <turbopebble> Pokio.

[15:52] <doctorzzz> this might be the best platformer in 20 years 
[15:52] <neospartanhesperos9> i doubt that 
[15:52] <doctorzzz> dethroned sm64 

[15:52] <bethemadeagle> lol daniel bryan wants to come back and wrestle :D 
[15:52] <bobbi_ling> they should play benoits theme on raw as if he returned LUL 

[15:52] <darthradovanviking> It all starts at the top. The WWE Chairman who has won championships while 
wrestling for his own company admitted in 1994 that he had distributed steroids to performers and that he had 
also used them himself. Vince McMahon 

[15:53] <bethemadeagle> he will just get injured and be a cripple then what would birdiebee do without her dad 

[15:53] <bethemadeagle> vidar that was back then now its different 

[15:53] <darthradovanviking> lol a bird that can't fly, what are you a penguin? 

[15:53] <darthradovanviking> a EMU

[15:54] <extracheeez> are u gonna 100% the game phil? want to see you try the dark/darker side challenges. :) 
[15:54] <doctorzzz> LOOOOL 

[15:54] <neospartanhesperos9> I'll never use steroids, but they don't make you bigger on their own. You still 
need to do the work to get the muscle. They mainly just accelerate recovery, but can still cause a large amount of 
health problem 
[15:54] <rlcool> lol 

[15:54] <bethemadeagle> vidar most wrestlers dont look buff enough for steriods in wwe lol but they probably 
have a few who use em 

[15:55] <bethemadeagle> so drink lemon and milk ok got it 

[15:55] <darthradovanviking> maybe it was different in the past. But many of the people that I think of when I 
think of wrestling is not just training buffs 
[15:55] <ghostlyectoplasm> lmaoo 

[15:55] <alexharveyconrad> This game has all the qualities. 

[15:55] <turbopebble> When did you drink Anzu then? 

[15:55] <deepdrive3254> If you like curdling milk bethe 

[15:55] <neospartanhesperos9> i’m also not religious, but i don’t think you should put anything into your body 
that's not natural to augment your appearance or performance. 

[15:55] <aisaidhello> Actually You were pretty far from the wall 

[15:56] <ihav4gotn> swiftrage20 phil do wrestlers use steroids, chat seems to think not 

[15:56] <bethemadeagle> vidar the women def dont use steroids most can be broke like a stick how skinny they 
arre 

[15:56] <bobbi_ling> those women arent wrestlers, they are models 
[15:56] <alexharveyconrad> You'd be surprised bethe...

then they're probably on a PED

[16:30] <thenintendoadvisor> Bernie Sanders 

[16:31] <secretbossfight> Well Ia€™m guessing Phil didna€™t mean any offense, Ricki might have identified 
as a gay guy back then. 

[16:31] <neospartanhesperos9> damn 

[16:31] <naokib4u> Why would Phil mean any offense? Lol he had no idea Ricky is trans now he isn’t part of the 
FGC

[16:32] <eldeadmariachi> Trans..formers is not a gender 

[16:32] <thatanonybear> Transgender existed literally thousands of years ago lol 

[16:32] <martyl3612> Trans talk on a mario video, maybe this is why Nintendo hates lets players lol 

[16:32] <kingjezal> Like, people in general didn’t recognize transgender as a concept, he might be saying. 

[16:32] <alexharveyconrad> Bethe stay safe mane... 

[16:32] <eldeadmariachi> *1 mean now 

[16:32] <darthradovanviking> cheerlOO well trans isn't actually retro active phil. 

[16:32] <naokib4u> There's some stuff to do at that spot after you beat this world 

[16:33] <thatanonybear> iirc some greek dudes would drink horse pee as a form of hormone therapy 

[16:33] <zah_rastafari> glad phils understanding now 

[16:33] <thatanonybear> everyone has a right to a vagina 

[16:33] <eldeadmariachi> Now we have LGBTSJW 

[16:33] <mysticfetus> That is pure BS. Just cause You were not aware of something doesnt mean is didnt exist 
[16:33] <iconicmasterl> More like the signs of the time 5Yn” 

[16:34] <ratchefanl2> BULLSHIT!!! 

[16:34] <kingjezal> @mysticfetus That's not what he was saying at all. 

[16:34] <naokib4u> @mysticfetus he means there wasn't really a name for it. No one really "identified" as trans 
[16:34] <turbopebble> Is he really going into the coin collecting!? 

[16:34] <eldeadmariachi> Ask religious guys about that 
[16:34] <thatanonybear> which religion? 

[16:34] <mysticfetus> he said it didnt exist, that is exactly his words 
[16:35] <thatanonybear> Hindus are p cool about it 

[16:35] <gotillajuice2009> cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl is the 
Nintendo switch worth buying for this game? 

[16:35] <kinggoken> yes @gotillajuice2009 
[16:35] <bohemiaplaza> Hi phil and chat 

[16:35] <eldeadmariachi> Christian special old people, they still dont accdpt this like gays or trans 
[16:35] <doctorzzz> COINS # 

[16:35] <ratchefanl2> MYSTIC 

[16:35] <darthradovanviking> it means if you "transition" you where still a man at some point, it doesn’t change 



your gender in the past phil cheer 10 

[16:35] <martyl3612> you missed purple coins midway through the beanstalk 
[16:35] <kingjezal> Xenoblade Chronicles 2 >

[16:36] <thatanonybear> @Kinggoken 7/10 TearGlove 
[16:36] <turbopebble> Is this the 9999 grinding spot? 

[16:36] <nolbert87> @mysticfetus hes saying it wasn’t talked about or many people being out as trans it was 

very closed off and not out in pop-culture 

[16:36] <flyeaglesfly01> lol 

[16:36] <kinggoken> lol 

[16:36] <dkpgames> Hello my dudes 

[16:36] <kozatof> What the hell does transition even mean 

[16:36] <thatindieglo> Dona€™t miss coins when you go up 

[16:36] <kingjezal> Yeah, transgender doesn’t necessarily imply a change in gender. 

[16:36] <doctorzzz> phil when you climb the stalk tgere are some coins visible 
[16:36] <thatanonybear> @kozatof transition from male to female, and the other way 
[16:36] <martyl3612> Phil there was purple coins you missed halfway up the beanstalk 
[16:36] <mariol080p> Hey Look, Phil is playing Sonic Forces haha 
[16:36] <naokib4u> LOL 

[16:37] <mysticfetus> thats cause trans was demonized and made fun of in pop culture, watch Ace Ventura or 
any Jerry Springer? 

[16:37] <ghostlyectoplasm> cheerlO purple coins near the base of the bean stalk btw 
[16:37] <beatlesl2335> Phil ride the beanstalk again, on the way up theres purple cpons 
[16:37] <dkpgames> Are my msgs not appearing in chat 
[16:37] <thatanonybear> it's silly that you have to replant it each time 
[16:37] <beatlesl2335> *coins 

[16:37] <superbatcat> if everyone was the same it would be a very boring world 
[16:37] <flyeaglesfly01> @DKPGames No 

[16:37] <easton_taylorl> @darksydephil grab the purple coins first 
[16:37] <ghostlyectoplasm> god damn it lol 

[16:37] cjeremylOl 123> climb the stalk and you see in on the next area to jump on 

[16:38] <dkpgames> Oh thats a relief, im just ignored not a bug 

[16:38] <ghostlyectoplasm> thank god X’D 

[16:38] <thatanonybear> @DKPGames salutations comrade 

[16:38] <flyeaglesfly01> @DKPGames Ah 

[16:38] <neospartanhesperos9> Team DarkSydePhil Gaming 

[16:38] <kingjezal> @DKPGames I just missed your post 

[16:38] <bpharu> so Mario Odyssey is a better 3D Sonic than Forces 

[16:38] <dkpgames> Hi bear 

[16:38] <ghostlyectoplasm> so uhh who builds these ... sky ramps 

[16:39] <neospartanhesperos9> LOL 

[16:39] <naokib4u> LOL OMG 

[16:39] <doctorzzz> PogChamp 

[16:39] <ghostlyectoplasm> X’D 

[16:39] <dkpgames> Sonic is still better than mario 

[16:39] <matitoooo> OMG 

[16:39] <thatanonybear> @GhostlyEctoplasm Waluigi, pulling favors too try to finally get his own game 



[16:39] <ccous666> wow PogChamp 

[16:39] <i_came_here_to_something> @BPHaru Well, Odyssey's a better game than Forces as a whole, not a 
surprise there 

[16:39] <bobbi_ling> would you rather date sonic or mario? 

[16:39] <superbatcat> really getting good at the hat jump Phil 
[16:39] <thatanonybear> @Bobbi_Ling Mario, Sonic's still a child 
[16:39] <easton_taylorl> some one clip that 

[16:39] <ghostlyectoplasm> @ThatAnonyBear did he build bowsers castle too lmao 

[16:39] <i_came_here_to_something> I don't think it's a 97 or perfect game by any means, but it's still quite 
better than Forces 

[16:40] <eldeadmariachi> I would love a Waluigi game 

[16:40] <dkpgames> Nope the worst Sonic game is better than the best mario 

[16:40] <yossarianl988> Great work dude. 

[16:40] <doctorzzz> just go the fall and jump on 

[16:40] <somonel92> hint: you've only seen half the game 

[16:40] <i_came_here_to_something> @DKPGames Let's not talk crazy stuff 

[16:40] <doctorzzz> you can dive and hat jump 

[16:40] <dkpgames> Its true 

[16:40] <i_came_here_to_something> Boom and '06 are nowhere on the level of the Galaxy games 
[16:40] <turbopebble> Money grinding area? 

[16:41] <cjuphoria> Is Luigi in this gam? 

[16:41] <ghostlyectoplasm> AAAA 
[16:41] <doctorzzz> Jebaited 

[16:41] <mysticfetus> I've been a fan of Phil since he began but I know he has been a transphobic doof since he 
was palling with Rambo. Perhaps he should educate himself before saying false things like we didnt exist. Trans 
women of color startd the stonewall riots which kicked off the gay rights movement in the 70s 
[16:41] <dkpgames> True, they r Above galaxy 
[16:41] <somethingyer2> !j oin 

[16:41] <neospartanhesperos9> @DKPGames Your opinion sucks btw CoolStoryBob 

[16:41] <kingjezal> This is like 90% of BotW 

[16:41] <superbatcat> Just started this game myself having a blast

[16:41] <suckasurprise> Phil buddy you have a huge cowlick lol 

[16:41] <i_came_here_to_something> @DKPGames Now you're just being Kappa 

[16:41] <bobbi_ling> i got no bananas on pc dspCowboy 

[16:41] <ratchefanl2> i gave mystic a chance i was about to ban him too 

[16:42] <turbopebble> They are not in this game. 

[16:42] <turbopebble> Boo is not in Mario Odyssey. 

[16:42] <neospartanhesperos9> @DKPGames i like soccer, doesn’t mean i shit on American Football like a bias 
donkey CoolStoryBob 

[16:42] <dkpgames> Its my opinion, u wont change 
[16:42] <thatanonybear> opinions are like assholes

[16:43] <eldeadmariachi> Soccer DansGame I think you meant Football 



[16:43] <tr9000> anti cheese 

[16:43] <thatanonybear> @DKPGames you can bleach it LUL 

[16:43] <thatanonybear> tsosBB 

[16:43] <dkpgames> U aren’t prison to do that 

[16:43] <ratchefanl2> your vnot darth after what he had just said i was gonna ban him 
[16:43] <nightbot> Pips and pops and paps just tipped $2.00 

[16:43] <i_came_here_to_something> @DKPGames Your opinion is literally objectively wrong. You'd have a 
much stronger point if you were just talking about the classic 2D Sonics and 2D Marios (even there, I’d say they 
mostly tie, neither’s outright better than the other). 

[16:43] <kingjezal> Papsicolo...? 

[16:43] <thatanonybear> gloryhole moon 
[16:44] <nolbert87> Ibananahammockparty 

[16:44] <bobbi_ling> why do soccer fans get so uptight when you call it soccer? 

[16:44] <deepdrive3254> Later bethe 

[16:44] <dkpgames> No a opinionabout a game cant be objectively wrong 

[16:44] <tr9000> it's too picky 

[16:44] <hands_celebratory> she's saying no 

[16:44] <tr9000> i guess your pecker is too big for the hole 

[16:44] <kingjezal> Inconsistency! 

[16:44] <bobbi_ling> beths long gone deep LUL 

[16:44] <eldeadmariachi> Soccer is what the moms deliver their kids. Football is the actual mens sport 

[16:44] <i_came_here_to_something> It can be if it's based on faulty evidence 

[16:44] <thatanonybear> dvvt his pecker's too big LUL 

[16:45] <thatanonybear> fawking size of a tree trunk 

[16:45] <dkpgames> Its not the case 

[16:45] <deepdrive3254> Oh 

[16:45] <nolbert87> rip mario 

[16:45] <ghostlyectoplasm> XDD 

[16:45] <andyzadistic> lol 

[16:45] <ghostlyectoplasm> "im gonna be a crazy asshole" 

[16:45] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling Because its called Football? 

[16:45] <i_came_here_to_something> It is if you're saying the worst Sonic game's better than the best Mario 
game o.O 

[16:45] <dkpgames> If Sonic is more fun for me theres nothing u can do 
[16:45] <bobbi_ling> soccer is a form of football 
[16:45] <enzio814> nah dont milk it...its almost 5 
[16:45] <ghostlyectoplasm> omfg 

[16:45] <doctorzzz> wow i did not see that moon from up there 

[16:45] <bobbi_ling> its called soccer 

[16:46] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling Its not but cool. 

[16:46] <tr9000> I really love how there is no fall damage here. Is this the first 3d mario game not to have it? 
[16:46] <bobbi_ling> is too 

[16:46] <i_came_here_to_something> Just because something's more fun for you doesn’t mean it's "better" than 

something else. I like The Matrix more than Blade Runner, but can say Blade Runner is a better-made film 

[16:46] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling LUL 

[16:46] <superbatcat> Kicking butt and taking names Phil 

[16:46] <kingjezal> By this point Bowser should know how this ends 

[16:46] <dkpgames> It is true, i enjoyed Sonic 06 more than mario galaxy 

[16:47] <ghostlyectoplasm> ON THE MOON 

[16:47] <neospartanhesperos9> British called it soccer before Americans did, when Americans called 'eggball' as 
football and the other sport as soccer, the british chose to called it football instead. 

[16:47] <ghostlyectoplasm> why i cant marry bowser on the moon 



[16:47] <thatanonybear> https://clips.twitch.tv/PerfectApatheticTarsierImGlitch 

[16:47] <bobbi_ling> if u say football people will think you mean nfl 

[16:47] <flyeaglesfly01> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 Really lol? I have never heard that before 

[16:47] <nolbert87> Peach really needs to learn some MMA or something 

[16:47] <neospartanhesperos9> i did 

[16:47] <i_came_here_to_something> Okay, but Galaxy is an objectively better made and more polished game. 

It has none of Sonic ’06's glitches or roughness, and its levels are more immaculately designed 

[16:47] <neospartanhesperos9> Football Daily 

[16:47] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling In America only 

[16:47] <thatanonybear> Peach’s standup game is pathetic 

[16:47] <turbopebble> Robobrood? 

[16:48] <i_came_here_to_something> I’d probably laugh a ton more playing ’06 vs. Galaxy, doesn’t mean I'm 
laughing b/c ’06's a better made game. It just isn't. 

[16:48] <nolbert87> Shitty Voltron 
[16:48] <doctorzzz> LOL 

[16:48] <secretbossfight> Always thought Mario games needed a Megazord boss Kappa 

[16:48] <kingjezal> Woww 

[16:48] <doctorzzz> climb with the BIRD 

[16:48] <kinggoken> sonic 06 was shet 

[16:48] <mariol080p> clutch 

[16:48] <turbopebble> Hammer Brother is easier lol. 

[16:48] <dkpgames> Its still boring, glitches could be fixed if ppl didn’t bitch so much 

[16:48] <eldeadmariachi> @bobbi_ling Thats for Americans only, in any other part of the world Football is 

soccer 

[16:48] <hindae> Whats happening boys and girls 

[16:48] <doctorzzz> you can poke em to death tho 

[16:48] <tr9000> I hate to say this, but it sorta looks like it's pooping 

[16:49] <flyeaglesfly01> @elDeadMariachi You mean anywhere else football is football 

[16:49] <thatanonybear> @elDeadMariachi which is interesting because the term "Soccer" was invented by a 

Brit at Oxford, one of the best at the game 

[16:49] <bobbi_ling> so you admit its soccer dspHinm 

[16:49] <turbopebble> I usually stay with the bird instead of exiting it. 

[16:49] <doctorzzz> dont stay so close 
[16:49] <kushiyakitori> :skull: 

[16:49] <darthradovanviking> oh no :C 

[16:49] <eldeadmariachi> @flyeaglesflyO 1 Yes i did it to presvent confusion 
[16:49] <doctorzzz> go back a touch 

[16:49] <thatanonybear> DSP's used to the pecker curving to the let 
[16:49] <thatanonybear> Kappa 

[16:49] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling Americans call it Soccer which is fine. Everywhere else its football 
[16:50] <i_came_here_to_something> You can play '06 on PC right now that made a lot of changes to make it 
better, but there's only so much mods can do. There's fundamental flaws in '06's physics and collision systems 
mods can’t fix. Only SEGA could fix them. 

[16:50] <flyeaglesfly01> @Bobbi_Ling I love both anyway 

[16:50] <eldeadmariachi> @thatanonybear Yes but this day most of British fans call it football 
[16:50] <darthradovanviking> nice poke phil 
[16:50] <rlcool> lol 

[16:50] <mariol080p> That was so close to the speedrun strat 

[16:50] <hindae> You can, its just difficult because the mech shakes you off 

[16:50] <doctorzzz> you can stay up there after you get thrown of you gotta hat jump back 

[16:50] <kingjezal> Predetermined fail 

[16:50] <dkpgames> You cant play 06 on pc, only a demo 



[16:50] <flyeaglesflyO 1> @elDeadMariachi *all 
[16:51] <kinggoken> when did Sega put Sonic 06 on pc? 

[16:51] <dkpgames> They didn’t 

[16:51] <thatanonybear> @I_Came_Here_To_Something oh dayum, btfo 

[16:51] <eldeadmariachi> @flyeaglesflyO 1 I try not to generalize when say something but if you think thats how 
it is ok then 

[16:51] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kinggoken He's right, it's just a demo. But that demo is still much more 
polished than the actual game 

[16:52] <i_came_here_to_something> It's also in-progress; they intend to finish porting the whole game over 
[16:52] <flyeaglesfly01> @elDeadMariachi I have never heard anyone here call it Soccer unless its as a joke 
[16:52] <dkpgames> Sega Would had fixed if Pretend to be fans didn’t bitch so much about it 
[16:52] <i_came_here_to_something> @ThatAnonyBear I mean we got a guy saying the worst Sonic's better 
than the best Mario tho Kappa 

[16:53] <thatanonybear> @I_Came_Here_To_Something i'm fine with this 
[16:53] <infinite_55> That was way too easy! 

[16:53] <nolbert87> DEAD! 

[16:53] <somonel92> out of the game dspHmm 

[16:53] <i_came_here_to_something> How is it the fans' fault SEGA rushed '06 for an artificial deadline and 
split the dev team midway through? 

[16:53] <neospartanhesperos9> We are the moon triplets 
[16:53] <dkpgames> If everyone could be like anonybear... 

[16:53] <eldeadmariachi> "I got a Munnn, A MUNNN" 

[16:54] <thatanonybear> be like me tsosHi 
[16:54] <bobbi_ling> panda? 

[16:54] <neospartanhesperos9> no thanks 
[16:54] <thatanonybear> a teddy bear, bobbi 

[16:54] <i_came_here_to_something> @DKPGames I guess you can't detect sarcasm? 

[16:54] <kinggoken> the graphics in that Sonic 06 demo look better than Sonic Forces graphics 

[16:54] <eldeadmariachi> @thatanonybear Have you seen how pandas looks without the spot on their eyes, they 

look silly lol 

[16:54] <dkpgames> Patches happens all the time,they didn’t bother because the fans were bitching 
[16:55] <mariol080p> Some of the Purple Coin located here are placed in really odd spots 
[16:55] <deepdrive3254> Anony panda will be your next name 

[16:55] <i_came_here_to_something> No, they didn't bother b/c Sonic Team never sticks to a formula and 
iterates on/polishes it any longer than the fiscal suits say they have to. 

[16:55] <eldeadmariachi> ThatAnonyMoose sounds better 
[16:55] <doctorzzz> FeelsBadMan 

[16:55] <turbopebble> So they never Badger to a formula (geddit) 

[16:56] <nolbert87> dspPepe dspYuck 

[16:56] <dkpgames> Im sorry did i say fans? I mean ppl who saw top 10 on youtubes 
[16:56] <kinggoken> Keepo 

[16:56] <beatlesl2335> The next world is quick phil, go ahead and do it =p 

[16:56] <kingjezal> It's a shame Nintendo couldn't be bothered to lock this stuff behind micro transactions. Lazy. 

[16:57] <dkpgames> Phil enjoyed forces and 06 soo 

[16:57] <kinggoken> lol @KingJezal 

[16:57] <kurojp> I wish this game had lootboxes 

[16:57] <kinggoken> Nintendo could make serious bank doing that 

[16:57] <i_came_here_to_something> But even many fans were complaining about how bad a state '06 shipped 
in, even at the time. And you can’t blame people watching Top 10s in 2017 on '06 not getting fixed, as if SEGA 
has a magic ball that can see into the future 

[16:57] <alexharveyconrad> Absorbing the bird... A new euphemism, perhaps? Kappa 
[16:57] <dkpgames> Mario still is the second best really 



[16:58] <turbopebble> So, Sonic Team never "the badger" to a formula? 

[16:58] <naokib4u> backside of the tower 

[16:58] <thatanonybear> @alexharveyconrad pis LUL 

[16:59] <thatanonybear> MrDestructoid ABSORB BIRD MrDestructoid 

[16:59] <i_came_here_to_something> Mario's the 2nd best, yet his latest game's on GOTY lists and has satisfied 
pretty much all the fans, fttp. The only Sonic games of late that have even come close to that are Mania and 
Generations. And even in their cases, it wasn't quite as universal of praise (tho it was still very good overall) 
[16:59] <neospartanhesperos9> What a long climb CoolStoryBob 

[16:59] <dkpgames> They were ready to release a patched version for PC but they said screw this fans are 

bitching we wont get any money 

[16:59] <doctorzzz> did he forget the moon ? 

[16:59] <naokib4u> You didnt grab the moon 
[16:59] <kingjezal> Did he pick it up? 

[16:59] <naokib4u> LOL 

[16:59] <alexharveyconrad> doot doot... 

[16:59] <tr9000> did you forget to physically pick up the moon? 

[16:59] <vanguard_il_nero> he did 

[17:00] <calqlusl01> You left without the moon... LUL 

[17:00] <beatlesl2335> You fool!! D= 

[17:00] <doctorzzz> DarksydePhil YOU FORGOT THE MOON 
[17:00] <kingjezal> No moon for you, Phil. 

[17:00] <easton_taylorl> didnt even get the moon lol 

[17:00] <naokib4u> LOLL 

[17:00] <beatlesl2335> You Forgot!! 

[17:00] <beatlesl2335> Phil!!! 

[17:00] <kingjezal> 1 moon for the price of 2 

[17:00] <dkpgames> The majority opinion dont hold a candle to true fans 
[17:00] <thatanonybear> WHAT 

[17:00] <kinggoken> how many worlds are after this one? 

[17:00] <kinggoken> I forget 
[17:00] <naokib4u> HAHHAH omg 

[17:00] <neospartanhesperos9> it's really debatable which franchise is 'better', whether Mario or Sonic, they're 
just both great games franchises, leave it at that 
[17:00] <turbopebble> ur an forget? 

[17:00] <i_came_here_to_something> SEGA milks Sonic like a $2 whore yet won’t bother releasing an 
already-done ^improved* port of'06 on PC because a few people were offering constructive criticism? LUL 
LUL LUL 

[17:00] <tr9000> that would be a spoiler kinggoken 
[17:00] <alexharveyconrad> Well, hop to it bruh. B) 

[17:00] cjeremylOl 123> I was about to say no second moon lol. I thought i missed something 

[17:00] <kinggoken> Sonic used to be very good 

[17:00] <doctorzzz> the moon after this and then the secret stages 

[17:01] <kinggoken> in the 90s 

[17:01] <dkpgames> It even sounds like my opinion offends u lol 

[17:01] <kinggoken> he fell off 

[17:01] <kinggoken> after SA 2 

[17:01] <thatanonybear> NOOOO 

[17:01] <kingbuggetta> a bird killed my family 

[17:01] <alexharveyconrad> FailFish 

[17:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Dude, b/c your opinion makes zero sense LUL 
[17:01] <darthradovanviking> what would you have done without that important moon. :D 
[17:01] <vendatus> Sonic Shuffle best game LUL 



[17:01] <dkpgames> Thats why we need SA3 no more boost gameplay or classic 
[17:01] <kushiyakitori> :tf: 

[17:01] <darthradovanviking> FFS phil 
[17:01] <neospartanhesperos9> wow 

[17:01] <kinggoken> i remember really wanting to play Sonic Shuffle 
[17:02] <alexharveyconrad> LUL 

[17:02] <thatanonybear> Sonic Shuffle literally cheating ResidentSleeper 

[17:02] <i_came_here_to_something> @Kinggoken Definitely. After SA2 it got way more inconsistent. 

[17:02] <matitoooo> bruh 

[17:02] <kingjezal> 1 or 2 more deaths and we may be getting some salt... 

[17:02] <i_came_here_to_something> @DKPGames Now there's an opinion I can agree with 
[17:02] <dkpgames> It only makes sense if u love sonic 
[17:02] <kinggoken> lol dsp so focused

[17:04] <ghostlyectoplasm> XDD 

[17:04] <jeremyl01123> I'm dying this is too funny lol 

[17:04] <bpharu> I died like 10 times trying to get that moon, I don’t know how you got it first try before 
[17:04] <somonel92> lol forgets the moon...goes up forgets the key, goes down...ded 
[17:04] <kingjezal> Thanks Miyamoto 

[17:04] <i_came_here_to_something> I want the best for Sonic, just like any fan. But I can’t lie to myself and 
say the worst Sonic games of late (Boom, ’06, Lost World to a lesser extent) are better than the best Mario games 
of late, like the Galaxies, 3D World, or Odyssey. That'd just make things worst for the Sonic franchise. 

[17:04] <neospartanhesperos9> @I_Came_Here_To_Something CoolStoryBob 

[17:04] <darthradovanviking> this is how you supermario oddesey 

[17:04] <doctorzzz> this is too funny 

[17:04] <ghostlyectoplasm> OMG 

[17:04] <naokib4u> HAH AH lmao 

[17:04] <flyeaglesfly01> cheerl30 Any plans for another COD session? Or for fan appreciation? Would be good! 
[17:04] <kingjezal> dspFun 

[17:05] <naokib4u> You gotta love how he got it in 1 try the first time now he can't get it 

[17:05] <alexharveyconrad> And to think some people wanted Phil gone... Who could replace this? LUL 

[17:05] <thatanonybear> https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueAntsyEchidnaDeIlluminati 




[17:05] <kinggoken> oh snap. Dsp gonna get battlefront 2 

[17:05] <dkpgames> Just throwing the words "Best" and "Worst" is biased, we will never reach agreement 
[17:05] <thatanonybear> !schedule 

[17:05] <nightbot> Nov. 15: Super Mario Odyssey stream at 12:30pm PST! 

[17:05] <sirnoblex> Battlefield 2? 

[17:05] <neospartanhesperos9> ’battlefield’, it's ’battlefront’ lol 
[17:05] <sirnoblex> :) 

[17:05] <kinggoken> he meant battlefront 2 lrnao 
[17:05] <doctorzzz> he did it 
[17:06] <sirnoblex> I know, I'm kidding 
[17:06] <thatanonybear> Star Trek Battlefield 2 

[17:06] <chairmancaleb> Lol, it basically is Battlefield with the star wars skin LUL 
[17:06] <kinggoken> true lol 

[17:06] <darthradovanviking> sadly it was a moon and not the moon. 

[17:06] <kinggoken> very true 

[17:06] <i_came_here_to_something> I guess not. Prob the only thing I can say modern Sonic does better than 
these Mario games is the music...altho most of Force's soundtrack isn’t top-notch imho 
[17:06] <kinggoken> yeah the music in the sonic games are on point 
[17:07] <crashed_ink> The lyrics on forces are not really my thing... 

[17:07] <i_came_here_to_something> Imagine a Mario game w/ Crush 40 doing the OST Kreygasm 
[17:07] <alexharveyconrad> We 'member. 

[17:07] <thatanonybear> i miss Katamari OST 
[17:07] <thatanonybear> *OSTs 
[17:07] <kinggoken> it would be epic 
[17:07] <kingjezal> The coffers... 

[17:07] <dkpgames> Its laughable to even debate music, mario does 1 song good now, thats it, 1 and its cringy
