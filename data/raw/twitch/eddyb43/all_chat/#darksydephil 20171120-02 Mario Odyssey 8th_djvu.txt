[19:53] <rylanodory> @girlonduty wtf am i watching explain 

[19:53] <ratchefanl2> yes from the sole reason the ad black hole happened lol 

[19:53] <bossbabyreturns> you should take over for Charles martinet 

[19:53] <raisinbreadistasty> cheerlO Hey Phil, enjoy your playthroughs, particularly your Overwatch gameplay. 

I was wondering if you’d find time to play the new hero Moira that was recently released? Tha nk s! 

[19:53] <beatlesl2335> Make sure you try to do a fair chunk of the postgame. Very fun! 

[19:54] <bossbabyreturns> have you not beaten the game??? 

[19:54] <takumibun> overwatch play through? 

[19:54] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil whats the hardest part for you when it comes to uploading videos? i’d 
assume it being the "find a part name for X Y Z video" i.e "Another Priest, Another Assassination" 

[19:54] <comfrtblynumb> overwatch?? HaAHAH you're not gonna see Phil play that game 
[19:55] <bossbabyreturns> can you guys see my messages? 

[19:55] <bammbino> @BossBabyReturns yes 

[19:55] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil I'll email ya later phil i just wanted to wait until the streams weredone for 
the day 

[19:55] <bossbabyreturns> @Bammbino ty 

[19:55] <kozatof> @bossbabyreturns no 

[19:55] <bossbabyreturns> @kozatof deep in the meme 



[19:56] <kozatof> You know it 5Y...±ij □ □ 

[19:56] <bufbills5121 > when does the stream start? 

[19:56] <lord_palpi> @DarksydePhil looking forward to mario sunshine in January ! 

[19:56] <bossbabyreturns> @DarksydePhil if you're playing for like 2 hours now, you could easily finish the 
story segment of the game... 

[19:57] <takumibun> SEX 

[19:57] <popsicolo> Hellboob: Senua's sex war 

[19:57] <secretbossfight> Scuze me sir, but "King of Hate" is not advertiser friendly 
[19:57] <teamguardanator> WAR 
[19:57] <electrumguy> tough job 

[19:57] <bossbabyreturns> is hell blade worth finishing? i played for like 10 mins and got kinda bored... 

[19:58] <yolodopper> cheer 10 is youtube becoming pro SJW and pg rated with all the demonetization? 

[19:58] <bammbino> dang lol 
[19:58] <riley_212> Damn 

[19:58] <popsicolo> Phil reviewing food isn't advertiser friendly, but videos of Elsa and Spider-Man shitting and 
pissing still have ads. 

[19:58] <teamguardanator> man. 

[19:59] <takumibun> payload lol 

[19:59] <thatanonybear> name all your videos "DSP FINGER FAMILY SONG" 

[19:59] <secretbossfight> If YouTube held the revenues when you filed a complaint the way they do when you 

dispute a false copyright claim, it wouldn’t be a problem 

[19:59] <bossbabyreturns> youtube is slow, that's why twitch is so good 

[19:59] <popsicolo> Phil should add the keyword "toy review" to his videos. 

[19:59] <bammbino> i couldnt do YT as a job 
[20:00] <bammbino> NO WAY 
[20:00] <takumibun> 3 hours 

[20:00] <solid_fantasy> I just saw Coco, time to watch some Mario before writing 

[20:01] <bentboxer> does that mean coco is good or not good @solid_fantasy 

[20:01] <takumibun> $1 EleGiggle 

[20:01] <bossbabyreturns> i played the game for free 

[20:02] <solid_fantasy> It's very good 

[20:02] <soupysean68> *wink wink* $$$ *nudge nudge* 

[20:02] <solid_fantasy> It has the animated feature Oscar locked 
[20:02] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil can I get a lap dance if I tip 100 USD? 

[20:02] <gutty333> lol 

[20:02] <bentboxer> cant dance sexily on twitch sorry @Gutty333 

[20:03] <kozatof> Cheer 696969696969969696 

[20:03] <popsicolo> Moira is pretty good PogChamp 

[20:03] <kekon3> Moira is pretty fun 

[20:03] <kekon3> definitely maining her 

[20:03] <anakhaful> stop talk play game 

[20:03] <popsicolo> My favorite part of Phil's Overwatch gameplay is when that one Junkrat player would carry 

his games. popsicSmug 

[20:04] <ratchefanl2> BE PATIENT 

[20:04] <kekon3> Who would that be Pops, Kappa 

[20:04] <popsicolo> How knows. KappaHD 

[20:04] <popsicolo> *Who 

[20:04] <bossbabyreturns> i like the beginning of that one dsp tries it orisa video 
[20:04] <raisinbreadistasty> Cool, thanks for answering my question Phil! 

[20:04] <bossbabyreturns> @raisinbreadistasty no prob 

[20:04] <kekon3> People still instalocking Moira on PS4 tho, best to wait for a bit 
[20:04] <takumibun> sjw EleGiggle 



[20:05] <popsicolo> Instalocking a support? PogChamp 
[20:05] <bentboxer> left wing in america is the right wing in europe 
[20:05] <thatanonybear> TO THE LEFT, TO THE LEFT 
[20:05] <bossbabyreturns> moira is kinda obsolete on pc already tbh 
[20:05] <soupysean68> HotPokket 

[20:05] <i_came_here_to_something> Phil, the ADVERTISERS are the ones telling Youtube to pull ads from 
controversial vids. Damnit! 

[20:05] <nich2440> it's sad that people use political values as insults 
[20:05] <i_came_here_to_something> Youtube's hands are tied 
[20:05] <neospartanhesperos9> CoolStoryBob 
[20:05] <pray4rock> Yup 

[20:05] <i_came_here_to_something> It's all on the advertisers, 

[20:06] <neospartanhesperos9> i want to see that Junkrat that woul carry Phil's games again. I miss him dspPepe 

[20:06] <tr9000> I'm not sure what it's a safe place for, everything gets flagged and demonitorized 

[20:06] <kekon3> Another One Kappa 

[20:07] <bammbino> #FuckYoutube #FuckTheFCC 

[20:07] <popsicolo> You should watch his last vod then, Neo. popsicSmug 

[20:07] <thatanonybear> saf space for linger family videos 

[20:07] <thatanonybear> except the brother finger's dead 

[20:07] <popsicolo> The audio was too quiet this time NotLikeThis 

[20:07] <anakhaful> did he talk about patreon yet 

[20:07] <popsicolo> But at least the cracks are gone TriHard 

[20:07] <bentboxer> al gore rhythm that doesnt work... damn you al gore!! 

[20:08] <bossbabyreturns> time for italian plumber action 
[20:08] <girlonduty> HeyGuys 

[20:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @tr9000 Exactly. It's not even just right-wing vids that get flagged and 
de-monitized anymore. Anything that isn't Disney G-rated stuff is getting hit, no matter where it falls politically. 
[20:08] <tr9000> so youtube is now a safeplace for rip off videos aimed toward children but includes 
questionable activities such as murder and theft among other things? 

[20:08] <breath321> How many thousands of people would you need though? to filter through every single one 

of the videos that get posted every single day 

[20:08] <rylanodory> @GirlonDuty HeyGuys 

[20:08] <girlonduty> Rylanodory HeyGuys

[20:10] <mr5twitch> twitch staff is just as bad in some cases but they are much better than youtube 
[20:10] <beatlesl2335> We love you Twitch! :( 

[20:10] <chairmancaleb> @GirlonDuty Nice to see a staff member. 

[20:10] <neospartanhesperos9> RATCHEFAN DAFUQ SwiftRage 

[20:10] <pray4rock> [uptime 

[20:10] <bammbino> twitch cops here! HIDE 

[20:10] <tr9000> the algorithm is terrible because it's seems based off old information probably from the 90s 
where everything is against everyone's sensibilities, so it flags everything. They couldn’t even make a new 
algorithm 

[20:10] <girlonduty> i’ve been a viewer for years :) 

[20:10] <rylanodory> @GirlonDuty wow thats a really good sub badge

[20:11] <n4tur3boy> Phil can you uber? 

[20:11] <ratchefanl2> youtube staph infection 

[20:11] <yolodopper> cheerlO they shud make an alogrithim that judges the video based on its context not on 
just some keywords 

[20:11] <kekon3> "Just sit there and dispute it" 

[20:11] <popsicolo> @DarksydePhil There are depraved videos that are targeting children on Youtube disguised 
at kid friendly that still get ads. There are millions of them. 

[20:11] <pray4rock> Well advertisers should be able to pick and choose what channels get there ads, much like 
network tv. 

[20:11] <bammbino> omfg?? hzd wow 
[20:11] <bammbino> that blows 

[20:12] <tr9000> we don’t have a bot smart enough to actually watch everything, only enough to compare it to 
existing stuff 

[20:12] <beatlesl2335> Yes 

[20:12] <n4tur3boy> Phil uber dspHmm 

[20:12] <sncomics> im your host colossal is crazy 

[20:12] <ratchefanl2> and i wanted to make youtube videos once i started a sly 1 playthrough 
[20:12] <beatlesl2335> they are 

[20:12] <bentboxer> bad bad bad bad robot... you make me feel so good 
[20:12] <trihard41iife> ResidentSleeper 
[20:12] <thatanonybear> Sly :D 

[20:12] <secretbossfight> I mean, Howard Stern used to have trouble finding advertisers, too. Companies are 
wary of sponsoring people saying things they wouldn’t say at work. Robot is running crazy, too. 

[20:13] <tr9000> @bentboxer you should shorten it to just bot, robot is too many syllables. 

[20:13] <thatanonybear> Hoo hoo Robin 



[20:13] <soupysean68> ResidentSleeper PogChamp ResidentSleeper 

[20:13] <pray4rock> Correct @secretbossfight especially after the pewdiepie incident 

[20:13] <thatanonybear> "I invented advertiser unfriendly, Robin! hoo hoo" 

[20:13] <popsicolo> Ithebot 

[20:13] <nightbot> Omnipotent. Omniscient. Sovereign. Immutable. How sweet it is to be a bot! MrDestructoid 
[20:13] <bentboxer> howard stern is making like 90 mil a year and he's still running ads on his show 
[20:13] <sncomics> *context 

[20:13] <kekon3> Context, not content... I think thats the plot to Metal Gear Solid 2 
[20:13] <popsicolo> Can you teach a robot how to love? MrDestructoid 

[20:13] <secretbossfight> @pray4rock I don’t blame PDP for this, a guy has been calling YT’s sponsors when he 
finds monetized videos by extremists and radicals. 

[20:13] <standingalonepete> it is kekon lol 
[20:13] <sncomics> kekon3 lol 

[20:13] <bentboxer> can you teach a robot how to dougie 

[20:14] <ayylebo> MrDestructiod MrDestructiod THE Robot is F L A W E D MrDestructiod 
[20:14] <majinboo3> The Law is absolute popular to popular belief the Law doesnt change by itself 
[20:14] <secretbossfight> We're talking, like, violent militant groups. Not just trolls. 

[20:14] <tr9000> @bentboxer I think it's more about having someone host his show than needing funding for it? 
[20:14] <ratchefanl2> WHAT IS LOVE BABY DONT HURT ME

[20:21] <tr9000> fighting against bugs bunny it seems 
[20:21] <riley_212> Hahahahaha 
[20:21] <girlonduty> Ornightz what verification? 

[20:21] <boonwood> Baited 
[20:21] <ratchefanl2> lol 

[20:21] <ornightz> the check by the name GirlonDuty 

[20:22] <anakhaful> @GirlonDuty can you verify me on twitter please? :) 

[20:22] <bammbino> not gonna lie, this stage's song is annoying 
[20:23] <girlonduty> Ornightz what do you mean? 

[20:23] <ornightz> You can only get verified through twitch by having a twitter account? 

[20:23] <girlonduty> which checkmark? 

[20:23] <ornightz> That one 

[20:23] <popsicolo> Lets Wabi-Sabi this rock garden MineLee 
[20:23] <kekon3> Bowser's showdown arena at the Zen Garden? 

[20:23] <popsicolo> MingLee 
[20:23] <girlonduty> 4Head 

[20:23] <bossbabyreturns> i know where your last 3 coins are 
[20:23] <ratchefanl2> i think he means the one byyour user name 

[20:24] <girlonduty> Ornightz this checkmark is for partners only, it's not a verification badge. 

[20:24] <fawriss> spoke too soon my friend 

[20:24] <ornightz> Oh I need to be partnered huh Hrm... 

[20:24] <tr9000> would you ever consider using a bowser amiibo to help you find any missing world coins? 
[20:24] <succkonlemon> Twitch staff WutFace 

[20:24] <bossbabyreturns> @tr9000 the coins are all relatively ez to find 
[20:24] <extracheeez> this is the most annoying dungeon in the game 
[20:25] <tr9000> isn't he missing 3 coins in the snow world though? 

[20:25] <bossbabyreturns> no phil 

[20:25] <neospartanhesperos9> well i mean now that i remember it more clearly, in Mario 64 it wasn’t japanese 
styled just like this one but it had a ninja, weeby style to it. No one remembers that forest stage with the Goomba 
King at the end 
[20:25] <bossbabyreturns> no 

[20:25] <ornightz> Would the twitch partnership program get me the checkmark too GirlonDuty ? 

[20:25] <bossbabyreturns> would you like me to tell you how to play the stage? 

[20:25] <anakhaful> pretty sure that is the only way to get it 
[20:25] <bossbabyreturns> you need a path ffs 
[20:26] <bossbabyreturns> i have 100%ed the game, trust me 
[20:26] <breath321> @BossBabyReturns lol don't bother 

[20:26] <tr9000> I think he wants to figure it out on his own, since you already seen/played this stage you 
already know the answer so it probably would bug you to see someone else play it 
[20:26] <girlonduty> Ornightz that's what i said earlier 

[20:27] <extracheeez> don’t tell him he needs to suffer like everyone did on this shit dungeon 
[20:27] <ratchefanl2> oh boy 

[20:28] <bossbabyreturns> long jump to double hat throw 

[20:28] <ornightz> I meant was the one offered during the summer , was it called affiliate? 

[20:29] <neospartanhesperos9> hop hop hop 
[20:29] <girlonduty> affiliates do not get checkmarks 



[20:29] <girlonduty> only partners, as i said earlier.

[20:35] <kozatof> The irl streamers wear nothing just for bits and tips 

[20:35] <breath321> @DarksydePhil If you want to be like a girl streamer, just switch the gameplay and cam 
sizes around and bam 

[20:35] <blacksunblood> yeah big boy take it

[20:38] <breath321> @GirlonDuty Since you're actually staff, is twitch gonna do anything about camgirls or 
that gonna become a twitch feature now? 

[20:38] <bossbabyreturns> i won’t tell you if you don't want to know 
[20:38] <ratchefanl2> https://clips.twitch.tv/InterestingGracefulAdminPRChase 
[20:38] <bammbino> @GirlonDuty if i may ask, what do you do for twitch?

[20:49] <gutty333> mario galaxy bits 

[20:49] <bossbabyreturns> i wish i could play mario galaxy 

[20:49] <bossbabyreturns> no wii tho 

[20:49] <kingjezal> @Breath321 No, it was mutual. 

[20:50] <gidgetf> Look at Phil being a genius 
[20:50] <bossbabyreturns> game logic, don't question it 
[20:51] <the_elusiveone45> Nintendo Logic 

[20:51] <neospartanhesperos9> questioning logic in a mario game lmfao LUL 

[20:51] <neospartanhesperos9> Only game that has logic is Metroid and that shit can be wonky sometimes too 
LUL 

[20:51] <mr5twitch> @neospartanhesperos9 thata€™s like asking why mario doesna€™t takes fall damage 
[20:51] <kittyspank> why is there sound in space 
[20:51] <jayjay2477> how many moons this guy got? 

[20:52] <bossbabyreturns> like 300 and something 
[20:52] <mr5twitch> @kittyspank asking the real questions 
[20:52] <thebigtj 1337> mini heart attack 

[20:52] <bossbabyreturns> i wonder if you'll beat the story in this sitting 

[20:53] <gidgetf> This game is actually getting me interested. Never really gave any attention to Mario 
[20:53] <neospartanhesperos9> Look at that mountain, you can go there \ CoolStoryBob 
[20:53] <realazyria> i like how he is not even close to collecting all the moons 

[20:53] <cjuphoria> maybe Mario's ghost hat has put an invincible bubble that protects Mario from fall damage 

and too able to breathe on the moon, lol 

[20:53] <neospartanhesperos9> chtulu WutFace 

[20:53] * neospartanhesperos9 pulls out machine gun 

[20:54] <bossbabyreturns> @GidgetF yea it's a rlly awesome game 

[20:54] <realazyria> because what i heard is that there is over 800 moons 

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> awww dont hit it TearGlove 

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> got him RitzMitz 

[20:54] <gidgetf> @bossbabyreturns yeah i can see that now. Lol I was really skeptical about them until I 
watched this. Thinking about trying it out 

[20:54] <bossbabyreturns> @RealAzyria yes 880 and you can buy all the way up to 999 
[20:55] <cte900> buy all the way up? 

[20:55] <bossbabyreturns> @GidgetF you should 
[20:55] <bossbabyreturns> i wish luigi was in the game 

[20:55] <realazyria> i think what he means after the 880 you can buy the rest in the stores 
[20:56] <neospartanhesperos9> wait what was the point of the bad ass fortress stage if there was no Bowser and 
still had to go to a moon world, what a cock block. I thought the game would end in that Japanese themed 
fortress LUL 

[20:56] <cte900> i see. didn’t realize there was almost lk moons 
[20:56] <extracheeez> the music on this stage sucks 
[20:56] <agoodrpg> yes 

[20:57] <bossbabyreturns> @Extracheeez it's serene 

[20:57] <gutty333> the views today have been really low. Less than 350 both streams 
[20:57] <chairmancaleb> Phil better collect all the starts in Super Mario 64 Kappa 
[20:57] <agoodrpg> lol 
[20:57] <chairmancaleb> stars* 

[20:57] <extracheeez> it's lazy ambient crap 



[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> slow fall of death 

[20:57] <bossbabyreturns> @Extracheeez i like the snow kingdom music 

[20:58] <neospartanhesperos9> dspPepe 

[20:58] <bossbabyreturns> is he back in new bonk city 

[20:58] <extracheeez> most of the stages have great tunes actually 

[20:58] <breath321> @Gutty333 yeah, sucks 

[20:58] <gidgetf> Yeah maybe some games attract more views than others @gutty333. it would be hard imo to 
constantly keep a large number of views for every game., idk how all this works ha Ia€™m new to this 
[20:58] <kingjezal> The only one, yes. 

[20:59] <ornightz> I wonder who asked that question... LUL 
[20:59] <babymangaming223> hello 
[21:00] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Toad LUL 
[21:00] <katexo234> LUL LUL 

[21:00] <breath321> It's amazing how video game movies are so similar to Star Wars Battlefront 2, both try to 

cash in from fans of the series as a whole, but aren't very good standalone products 

[21:00] <kittyspank> LUL THATS THE BEST JOKE 

[21:00] <xboxl_is_garbage> Have you watched the punisher yet? 

[21:00] <gidgetf> Punisher is amazing so far 
[21:00] <extracheeez> the clutchness 

[21:01] <cjuphoria> fun fact, john Leguizamo turned down a role in Philadelphia for Super Mario movie. 

[21:01] <gidgetf> Kilgrave is best villain so far.. 

[21:01] <tr9000> the movie was so terrible the actors had to be drunk just to get through it 
[21:01] <gidgetf> In the marvel Netflix universe 

[21:01] <bossbabyreturns> the movie has nothing to do with super mario right? 

[21:01] <tr9000> it used princess daisy, who as born from an egg for some reason 
[21:01] <kittyspank> the pest 

[21:01] <mr5twitch> well can you imagine a pizza man flying up to the moon during the final fight 

[21:02] <beatlesl2335> Phil its OK, did you hear Mario animated movie is coming? a good one to make up for 

the movie! 

[21:02] <bossbabyreturns> phil, pull off the sphinx skip 

[21:02] <realazyria> i think Phil is going to rage hard at the last secret kingdom 
[21:02] <breath321> has phil ever considered a different streaming style? 

[21:03] <solid_fantasy> It's from the Despicable Me team 

[21:03] <neospartanhesperos9> phil is wiping out an ancient alien moon race, this Mario game is depressing 
dspPepe 

[21:03] <gidgetf> What you mean by a different streaming style lol 
[21:03] <mr5twitch> isna€™t netflix making a zelda movie 

[21:03] <beatlesl2335> Its being made by the people that made the minions and "Sing" 

[21:03] <kittyspank> he's doing a lot better then he was a month ago 
[21:03] <extracheeez> lol u got trolled 

[21:03] <breath321> @GidgetL well, instead of buying every new game and playing it, some streamers focus on 
playing a multiplayer focused game for some time to see how much they can improve and get better, it's pretty 
entertaining 

[21:03] <solid_fantasy> and Despicable Me 
[21:03] <bossbabyreturns> you visit him later 

[21:03] <breath321> that's what I meant by that, think it would be fun to watch 

[21:04] <katexo234> well another live action tomb raider movie is coming out next year 

[21:04] <angelxtreme> you answered nno XD 

[21:04] <gidgetf> @breath321 ah I gotcha. I wonder what he thinks about that 
[21:04] <bossbabyreturns> enjoy this segment 

[21:05] <matitoooo> i have a feeling phil is going to rage in this part lol 
[21:05] <babymangaming223> phil seems a little tired. 



[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> it's dark and creepy in there dspPepe 

[21:05] <breath321> @GidgetF could bring in lots of new viewers to mix things up like that, would be fun to 
watch 

[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> nvm LUL 

[21:05] <the_elusiveone45> Sounds like Sonic music XD 

[21:05] <kittyspank> i only watch phil cause of all the games he plays i watch others if i want to see skill 
[21:05] <neospartanhesperos9> Lit as fuck CurseLit LUL 
[21:05] <bossbabyreturns> capture that bowser statue 

[21:05] <realazyria> but yea Phil you will rage rage rage at the last secret kingdom, will take you awhile to get 

there, but it will be fun to watch 

[21:05] <babymangaming223> bossbaby hello 

[21:05] <breath321> @Kittyspank Yeah agreed, but it would be entertaining to see phil gradually get better as he 
learned more 

[21:05] <extracheeez> i would pay money to watch phil play darker side 
[21:05] <bossbabyreturns> @babymangaming223 why hello fellow baby

him every day so I wouldn’t know 
[21:10] <bossbabyreturns> pit 

[21:11] <gidgetf> @breath321 I have only recently started watching and Ia€™ve heard him talk about destiny 
and that it was more of a long grind. Ia€™ve never cared to much about destiny either so idk what his thoughts 
on it actually are 

[21:11] <bossbabyreturns> just keep going 
[21:11] <neospartanhesperos9> wth 
[21:11] <soupysean68> ??? 

[21:12] <breath321> @GidgetF yeah destiny isn't exactly what I’d call skill based lrnao, it's more kind of an mmo 
[21:12] <gidgetf> Lol a wanna be mmo 

[21:12] <bossbabyreturns> i'm excited to see him beat the game 

[21:12] <breath321> yeah an mmo without any sort of chat feature is kinda funny, but still 
[21:13] <neospartanhesperos9> gameplay mechanics VoHiYo 

[21:13] <gidgetf> I just hate how ita€™s so dependent on the social aspect. Ita€™s fun but I cana€™t play it for 

to long before burning out 

[21:13] <bossbabyreturns> shake your controller

[21:35] <bossbabyreturns> no prob bowser, try it again bud 

[21:35] <realazyria> i do hope Phil knows he needs 500 moons to go to one of the secret kingdoms. 

[21:35] <neospartanhesperos9> @RealAzyria NOOOOOO 
[21:36] <neospartanhesperos9> dspPepe 

[21:36] <extracheeez> No he only needs 500 for darker side, dark side is less. 

[21:36] <solid_fantasy> Where does Bowser think that ring is going to fit on Peach 
[21:36] <satan_ontheflop> 'fit in peach 
[21:36] <nicoklk2> sup 

[21:36] <realazyria> he said he wanted to do all the secret kingdoms, which means he needs to get allot of the 
moons he missed 

[21:37] <neospartanhesperos9> how could phil have missed so many moons, it feels like he's only been short on 
each stage by like 7-10 and there's been much more he's missed wtf. this game is crazy 

[21:37] <extracheeez> well that's good he's planning to do them both, darker side will cause some historic rage 
moments for sure 

[21:37] <bossbabyreturns> whatevs, it's fun to revisit the kingdoms to get moons 

[21:38] <ewojo> cheer50 What Mario doesn’t realize is that the reason Peach keeps getting kidnapped is that she 
really wants that big Bowser D.

[21:59] <soliddave> buying them is a trap 
[21:59] <kittyspank> how dumb 
[21:59] <jaybirdl983> no 
[21:59] <chronaholic> LUL 
[21:59] <kingjezal> Oh my god... 

[21:59] <bossbabyreturns> arghghghg 

[21:59] <beatlesl2335> It euins the fun 

[21:59] <neospartanhesperos9> lol 

[21:59] <dweebenheimer20> LUL 

[21:59] <beatlesl2335> Its EZ mode 

[21:59] <kingjezal> I can’t believe he just did that... 

[21:59] <mormonfreeman> The moons are infinite 
[21:59] <jaybirdl983> cheating 
[21:59] <dezerved> you can buy 999 

[21:59] <mr5twitch> i cana€™t believe youa€™ve done this 

[22:00] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Your buying the moons youa€™re suppose to collect 
[22:00] <kusomoto> Why is it cheating 

[22:00] <extracheeez> If you want to track your progress to getting all legit moons it makes it harder. 
[22:00] <soliddave> Its pay to win to unlock stuff if you dont want to find them yourself 



[22:00] <bossbabyreturns> u can only collect 999 moons total so don't buy any till you get all the moons you can 
find in the game 

[22:00] <realazyria> its not cheating, thats how you get all the moons 
[22:00] <kingjezal> The worst mistake you could possibly make in this game 
[22:00] <chronaholic> LUL 
[22:00] <kusomoto> why 

[22:00] <extracheeez> u get the legit moons first then buy up to 999 
[22:00] <beatlesl2335> Its just the easy way to do it, ruins the fun 
[22:00] <jimmyquickscope> AHAHAHAHAHA 
[22:00] <bossbabyreturns> @Extracheeez exactly 
[22:00] <jimmyquickscope> LUL 

[22:01] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> This is like buying all the trophies in Neir Automata 
[22:01] <kittyspank> that's too hard dood

[22:02] <weeblol> Is this his 1st mario game? 

[22:02] <gutty333> does he have enough coins to say buy 200 moons? 

[22:03] <thatanonybear> @Gutty333 no, you cant hold that many coins at once 
[22:03] <gutty333> so how many moons can he get with 5k 
[22:03] <thatanonybear> he can buy 54 rn 

[22:03] <neospartanhesperos9> @DarksydePhil people are saying to collect the legit moons first and then buy 

the one’s you're missing, if you buy a bunch first you lose track of your progress on the moons you're suppose to 

collect, and it ruins the fun of finding them 

[22:04] <extracheeez> there is a secret moon 

[22:04] <extracheeez> yes 

[22:04] <jaybirdl983> try getting rid of spines 

[22:04] <gutty333> ok thats not bad honestly, he still has to grind and either find the moons or grind for coins 

[22:04] <weeblol> get rid of spines
