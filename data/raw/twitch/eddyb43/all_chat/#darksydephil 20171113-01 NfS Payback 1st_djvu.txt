Odyssey at 7:30pm PST! 

[12:29] <theycallmejimbob> hey Bobbi R)

[12:30] <gamemaster2003isdead> hello Phil how's life 

[12:30] <bobbi_ling> KonCha 

[12:30] <jetset3000> hey Phil 

[12:30] <ratchefanl2> hi phil 

[12:30] <darksydephil> would anyone happen to know of Need For Speed Payback runs at 30 or 60fps on PS4? I 

can’t find a definitive answer 

[12:31] <bobbi_ling> i guess not TPFufun 

[12:32] <ratchefanl2> i found something phil that says 30 

[12:32] <darksydephil> i guess i can start capturing at 30 and then change it if its 60...damn 
[12:32] <ratchefanl2> https://www.vg247.com/2015/09/15/need-for-speed-30fps-ps4-xbox-one-dlc/ 

[12:32] <ratchefanl2> here ya go phil 
[12:32] <racerbest> payback is 30fps 

[12:33] <thatanonybear> i’d expect 30, but that's crap for a next gen racer 
[12:33] <darksydephil> thats a different game ratchefanl2 lol 
[12:33] <kekon3> I'm seeing videos all capturing at 60 
[12:33] <ratchefanl2> lol 

[12:33] <racerbest> i have the game on ps4, it's 30 
[12:33] <deepdrive3254> thats from 2015 lol 

[12:33] <kekon3> makes sense if its 60 it's better for racers to have a good framerate 
[12:33] <ratchefanl2> @DarksydePhil opps thats need for speed lol 
[12:34] <racerbest> even on xbox one x it's 30 fps 
[12:34] <bobbi_ling> is logviewer a new bot? 

[12:34] <kekon3> oh wait, is this game day one on PC? 

[12:34] <bobbi_ling> MrDestructoid 
[12:34] <racerbest> yes this game is on pc also 
[12:34] <darksydephil> logviewer is the logging bot 
[12:34] <darksydephil> so i can go back and check chat logs 
[12:34] <darksydephil> its already been immensely helpful 
[12:34] <thatanonybear> logviewer i love you 

[12:35] <deepdrive3254> nice i know nightbot logs stuff but that can be hard to do 
[12:35] <ratchefanl2> 101 dalmatians is a great movie 
[12:35] <kekon3> I've been hearing mixed things on this game btw 
[12:35] <thatanonybear> @ratchefanl2 there wasnt enough dalmatians :P 
[12:35] <ratchefanl2> lol 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i guess ill start it at 30fps and we'll go from there 
[12:36] <gamemaster2003isdead> are we live 

[12:36] <deepdrive3254> i did a jigsaw puzzle called 101 damnations and all the dogs were almost identical lol 
[12:36] <racerbest> this game is awesome, ign and gamespot reviews are bs 
[12:36] <kekon3> almost 

[12:36] <racerbest> mainstream review sites shouldnt review racing games when they know nothing about them 
[12:36] <kekon3> btw phil, do you need any gifs for the games this week? 

[12:36] <kekon3> for cheers/bits/subs 

[12:37] <darksydephil> i dont think anything this week is big enough to warranty their own gifs except 



battlefront 2 

[12:37] <ratchefanl2> @ThatAnonyBear must have been hard for the animators 

[12:37] <darksydephil> Dr Zombius is working on a set for the holidays so thats the next one ill use unless 
someone else makes me some 

[12:38] <deepdrive3254> need for speed runs 60 fps on pc but not on console 
[12:38] <majinboo3> Phil you gonna jump on that online play?

[15:02] <twistedparadoxl333> im not a fan of eminem but his music at least has value and meaning unlike the 
garbage you hear nowadays like lil pump or whatever 

[15:02] <jefoliveira90> DSP only listen to the Washington underground rap scene 
[15:02] <kinggoken> lol true 

[15:02] <eternia_forever> he’s doin it @theycallmejimbob 
[15:02] <thatanonybear> i prefer June Yoor Mint 
[15:03] <doctorzzz> gg 

[15:03] <thatanonybear> and yes, that's a real rap group 
[15:03] <trashlogic> wonder if he listens to any podcasts

[15:03] <encelor> sllverPidrila he did it 

[15:03] <brahski20> cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl Do you stretch

[15:03] <thatanonybear> '97 Bonnie and Clyde is brilliant 



[15:03] <eternia_forever> always hit the one in the middle 
[15:03] <jesseplaysz> Question is. Should I buy NFS Payback chat?

[15:04] <taniaraven> yes buy it 

[15:04] <encelor> @Jesseplaysz imo no but if you like racing games go for it

[15:04] <jefoliveira90> lmao, do you stretch lol 
[15:04] <djrunol> for 2000$ 

[15:04] <encelor> i stretch my forskin Keepo 

[15:04] <twistedparadoxl333> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz i’d be too scared to date her.... especially after the 
stories i heard about how he would go off on his daughters about the most insignificant things 
[15:04] <encelor> i ripped it once 

[15:04] <thatanonybear> "i wouldnt stretch after" cmonBruh 
[15:04] <kovorus> LUL 

[15:04] <tony_thegreat_mahony> you should stretch after 
[15:04] <kinggoken> AA 
[15:04] <kinggoken> This 

[15:04] <eternia_forever> Can you picture phil doin them full splits son lol @theycallmejimbob 
[15:04] <encelor> Fisting is 300$ 

[15:05] <waifudestroyermatt> na you can damage muscles stretching after 
[15:05] <dukaduka> you have to stretch while lifting for max efficiency SeemsGood 
[15:05] <theycallmejimbob> WutFace not really EterniaForever :D 
[15:05] <bentboxer> eminem is like a short guy... im not afraid 

[15:05] <thatanonybear> iirc it's light cardio to warm up, stretch before, lift, then cooldown stretches after 
[15:05] <djrunol> for someone who has once lifted, phil sure knows very little about fitness 
[15:05] <trashlogic> in the gym, he was known as Fluffly 

[15:05] <brahski20> I could see Fill walking around the weight room sticking his chest out like it's an EB games 
[15:05] <lvlpower> you stuck the sun 

[15:05] <optionalsuperboss> lifting weights damages muscles., its how they grow 
[15:05] <jefoliveira90> Stretch before and after. 

[15:05] <jesseplaysz> @encelor I'm currently playing GT Sports, but I'm thinking about NFS. it seems arcadey 
to mee 

[15:05] <bentboxer> eminem is a midget in 2017 
[15:05] <jefoliveira90> Unless you are Phil 
[15:05] <thatanonybear> @trashlogic PLS LUL 

[15:05] <waifudestroyermatt> @OptionalSuperboss by damages i mean injures 

[15:05] <eternia_forever> YOU CAN DO IT 

[15:05] <doctorzzz> use the nitro CARD 

[15:05] <emirates89> looks like just another NFS game 

[15:05] <kinggoken> Eminem "walk on water" Listen to that 

[15:05] <twistedparadoxl333> @bentboxer im not afraid of him like actually afraid but i wouldnt want any 
confrontation with someone who probably wouldnt hesitate to pull out a gun or something lol

[16:25] <sprank_n> Fill's Spanish there wasnt that bad actually 

[16:25] <cresstheangel> the reason hes so behind is cause he loses all his speed when he hand breaks at turns 

[16:25] <djrunol> there are actually a lot of shortcuts throughout the track phil can take, the game should 

apologize for wanting the player to use his brain 

[16:25] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Hank Hill

[16:29] <nightbot> Anonymous just tipped $2.00 

[16:29] <cresstheangel> yeah you only need to hand break turns when its a really sharp turn. Drifting, corners 

and everything else the break is always optimal 

[16:29] <blacksunblood> i cant clip these ments fast enough 

[16:29] <thaslayer85> blames game for being bad at game lol 

[16:29] <mto2089> Phil would 1 shot wizpig in DKR. would also 1 shot nitrious in CTR 

[16:30] <genesisdestiny> does he not want the car there? should the game just be an open road with no turns . 

[16:30] <ferntastic> Let's watch him go over the cliff again :)

[16:33] <settodie> maybe if you play the game on very very very very very easy mode you could win this race. 
[16:33] <cresstheangel> she uses her break and you use your hand break, thats the difference phil 
[16:33] <superslygaming> phil is not really good at racing 

[16:33] <djrunol> @ThatAnonyBear i’d just like to see phil pay attention to a game for once, actually putting a 
tiny bit of efford into them, he just lacks it. he isn't even interested in half of them, that unfortunately to me is not 
very fun 

[16:33] <vendatus> she's not hand braking LUL 

[16:33] <suckasurprise> You need to listen to Initial D music so you don't lose speed while you drift 

[16:33] <doctorzzz> dont use the handbrake 

[16:33] <voltagemax> use the batmobile 

[16:33] <kozpat> dont use handbrake 

[16:34] <tony_thegreat_mahony> do you have another car ? 

[16:34] <kingjezal> cheerl021 Perseverance pays... 

[16:34] <jefoliveira90> Broken handbrake mechanics 

[16:34] <dolladalabill> why is she faster even though phil's car is a lower level than her's? steakScam 
[16:34] <pinkdam> @DJRunol watch another streamer if this isn’t fun... 

[16:34] <superslygaming> dont u just gas twice and u drift? 

[16:34] <doctorzzz> break normally and steer hard 
[16:34] <goldencolts> :0 

[16:34] <thatanonybear> @DJRunol tbf his role is to create entertaining content, and sometimes being upset is 

more entertaining than having fun and playing well 

[16:34] <eternia_forever> he is still cheering now that is dedication

[16:40] <eternia_forever> dammmmmmmmmmmmm 3 million dislikes @ThatAnonyBear how dare you 

[16:41] <musclesforbones> 30 fps is real life Kappa 

[16:41] <kingjezal> 30 FPS in 2017 Year of the Tusk. Unreal. 

[16:41] <doctorzzz> well cant speak for that because i down onw a console

[16:41] <radicalenzyme> Get a pc 

[16:41] <i_came_here_to_something> It's a shame that Daytona USA, a game from 1994, can run at 60fps when 
stuff like this and Driveclub can’t hit 30 in 2017. Fidelity matters in racing games 
[16:41] <dolladalabill> Forza and GT run at 60fps 
[16:41] <thatanonybear> 30fps is NES tier 

[16:41] <hands_celebratory> @thatanonybear Rebecca Black is a time traveling assassin. 

[16:41] <chairmancaleb> cheerlO Bailemos Phil, Bailemos! 

[16:41] <veera456> vohiyol60 hello, are you enjoying this so far?

[16:41] <kingjezal> @ratchefanl2 Nice, uneven cheer... 

[16:42] <iconicmasterl> People complain about 30 fps and 60 fps so much 

[16:42] <darthradovanviking> the song isn’t as bad when you don’t have to watch the music video 

@That AnonyB ear

[16:42] <retrocerverus> dspCowboy 

[16:42] <eckuk2> get a PC and play at 140 fps 

[16:42] <thatanonybear> @DarthRadovanViking it helps me remember what comes after Friday 
[16:42] <markymark52> cheerlO you need the power of Xbox One X for the extra 30 FPS. 

[16:42] <convertedclone> how would you spice it up then? 

[16:42] <gamesfordayys> anyone else pumped for battlefront 2 on friday?\ 

[16:42] <eternia_forever> maybe it runs at 60 fps on the x and pro cheerlO

[16:43] <thatanonybear> @Eternia_Forever it's 30fps but it's 8k resolution!! 

[16:43] <fluttershyl970> i wish they bring back burnout that was good racing game 

[16:43] <optionalsuperboss> what is beeping?! NotLikeThis 

[16:43] <markymark52> No it's not true 

[16:43] <markymark52> lol 

[16:43] <superslygaming> yes 

[16:43] <deepdrive3254> NOT TRUE it runs 60 on pc though 
[16:43] <jesseplaysz> the new place I like to be

[16:43] <dolladalabill> my weekend car PogChamp 

[16:44] <ratchefanl2> WRONG 

[16:44] <sprank_n> It runs 60 on the xbox one x 

[16:44] <iconicmasterl> Be happy with the game 

[16:44] <eazel> just turn on smooth motion and pretend its 60fps =p 

[16:44] <doctorzzz> you can use fullscreen with X to see it better 

[16:44] <markymark52> really it does? I was just joking rflmao 

[16:44] <jonnn901> pin the clue to the map 

[16:44] <cresstheangel> from what i heard xbonx doesn’t improve fps for games that are initially 30 fps 

[16:44] <doctorzzz> X 

[16:44] <doctorzzz> press x again 

[16:44] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> 10 years time it will 8K 200fps 
[16:44] <thatanonybear> I wish I was a lil bit taller dspShock 
[16:44] <eternia_forever> i do know that forza 7 runs at 4k 60 fps on the x cheerlO 
[16:44] <dooley258> Ita€™s 30 FPS on xbox one x 

[16:45] <retrocerverus> Mudrunner ps4 might have been more entertaining then dis dspDeath dspFacepahn 
[16:45] <sprank_n> not true xbox one x can run games at 60fps 

[16:45] <markymark52> ok I was just joking I didn’t think it did. I was being a smartass. 

[16:45] <soup_gg> dspPepe 

[16:45] <hot_rey> @darksydephil between green & yellow areas is the map in the bottom right hand corner 
[16:45] <veera456> vohiyolO to be fair, there isn’t much they can do to change up the racing game formula, 
there's a few different styles of racing game but there's not much that could be done outside of those styles, 
there's the more arcade/competitive oriented ones, the open world ones, etc. 

[16:45] <bobbi_ling> xox 

[16:45] <kozpat> the human eye cannot see anything faster than 60 FPS 



[16:45] <darthradovanviking> hey bobby 

[16:45] <marshmelons> gt sport runs at 4k 60fps 

[16:45] <thatanonybear> open world racing games are pointless

[16:46] <doctorzzz> i think you can enable navigation if you hover over your marker phil 
[16:46] <iconicmasterl> It basically nfs unground with modern graphics 
[16:47] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> who said 80’s galf is shit? DarkMode 
[16:47] <thatanonybear> Underground was substantially better
