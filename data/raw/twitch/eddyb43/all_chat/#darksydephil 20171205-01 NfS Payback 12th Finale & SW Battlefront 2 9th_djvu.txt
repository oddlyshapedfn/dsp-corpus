next year then. 

[11:55] <katexo234> *(§) gets egg nog 

[11:55] <cresstheangel> he said he was interested or somethin about The 
Crew 2 

[11:55] <pcgamehunter> Hmm delicious 

[11:55] <bammbino> @Kolal7_97 The Crew is not a good game for Phil due to 
the MMO-esque aspects 

[11:55] <ghostninjaftwl2> if i was phil i would quit playing it and play 
other games 

[11:55] <pcgamehunter> So BTW I didn't see the new movies, I die dont' 

I .... 

[11:55] <pcgamehunter> And my son kills me or something ? 

[11:55] <we_got_this> lol racing games that have a diff setting are 
inherently wrong 

[11:55] <kolal7_97> MMO like aspects and then the addition of plane and 
boat races 

[11:56] <pcgamehunter> Star Wars should be called the Angry Space 
Family .... OpieOP

monkey. It could help around the house and help to live stream games if 
you trained it well. Monkeys just eat vegetables and are easy to potty 
train, the only bad part is they're expensive, but it's legal to have a 
monkey in WA state I do believe. :0

[12:29] <bethelewd> Spcgamehunter :gun: 

[12:29] * bethelewd revives kate 

[12:29] <bionich00t> I recommend Phil get a pet orangutan. They can speak 
simple words so he could teach it to say "wow dood" and "please donate". 
The orangutan is smart enough that he could dress it in jeans and a white 
t-shirt and put a headset on it to do some of his streams. Although I'm 
not sure if Phil resembles an orangutan enough to make a good 
resemblance...

you need at least some kind of skill Kappa 

[14:57] <goldencolts> a breakfest roll is like a dumpling with breakfest 
stuff in it i think 

[14:57] <bethelewd> finn is stupid and should be killed off in last jedi 

[14:57] <chompstomp> second breakfast is the best 

[14:57] <theycallmejimbob> ah ty Holden_McGroin9 

[14:57] <holden_mcgroin9> finn is important because he's black 

[14:57] <pinkdam> ulster fry is best

tiiiiime 

[15:22] <djrunol> guys, it may seem like phil is complaining a lot but 
that is nothing but an illusion, what is a new twtich feature, it may 
seem like he is blaming the game, but in reality, he blames noone but 
himself, we just cannot understand the level of modesty 
[15:22] <castleemgbw> then jump away from the fucking flash retard

[15:25] <katastrophe> Pepe-ridge 

[15:25] <thatanonyraccoon> dspPepe I just want my viewers to respect me 
[15:25] <galileopumpkins> How can a person be so bad at videogames. Liker 
every single one. Usually a person has a game that theyre good at. Phil 
is unique in that he is so impatient that he is bad at every single game 
he plays. 

[15:25] <jeremyknight69> it's a shooting game still the same 




[15:25] <chairmancaleb> Sgalileopumpkins He's been good at a few games 
actually. 

[15:25] <djrunol> we have to realize that phil at this age is not capable 
to play these fast paced games anymore, it is difficult for him to focus 
on 2 things at once, or sometimes even 1 thing at once, but that's how 
life rolls 

[15:25] <bethelewd> raccoon i respect you and our relationship 
[15:25] <galileopumpkins> He. could, not. play, metal gear 
[15:25] <goldencolts> maybe play COD for the rest of stream? 

[15:25] <astrojetboy> I see @kushiyakitori 
[15:25] <ccous666> yu can play 1st person view? 

[15:26] <thatanonyraccoon> @BeTheLewd I respect you too, babe RaccAttack 
[15:26] <katastrophe> Dude jokes aside though, for real, anyone else feel 
their reaction time in FPS games has severely diminished ever since they 
hit their late 20s-30s? 

[15:26] <kalgorl23> Oh wait he's back on twitch? 

[15:26] <jeremyknight69> so you saying phil is slow 
[15:26] <cbvcalifloydian> no 
[15:26] <goldencolts> yeah 
[15:26] <kalgorl23> huh 

[15:26] <cbvcalifloydian> I've gotten better 
[15:26] <kalgorl23> Neat 
[15:26] <conky89> *slap* 

[15:26] <ccous666> guess not 

[15:26] <bentboxer> wookie coookie time 

[15:26] <eliteshadowninja> nope 

[15:26] <goldencolts> I play counter strike and just cant focus on the 

game any more at the level of people who are like 16 

[15:26] <kozatof> Sdarksydephil what's your thoughts on Amos yee@ 

[15:26] <bentboxer> did they nerf the wookie 

[15:27] <galileopumpkins> I think its kind of the opposite. I think he is 
so impatient and intent on doing the first thing he sees, he is incapable 
of being tactacle 

[15:27] <katastrophe> I totally recognize that GoldenColts, I used to 
dominate in FPS 1 s like Quake and CS , I cant play for shit anymore 
[15:27] <djrunol> @Katastrophe i once thought so too, but then i realized 
that it actually was my equipment that made me react slower because i 
wasnt used to my gaming mouse f.e. 

[15:27] <aes0411> If it was a real war, don't you expect that people 
would naturally surround you? 

[15:27] <kinggoken> younger kids have more time to play. That's why they 
are so good. 

[15:27] <wint3rmu7e> pick dva on overwatch, problem solved 
[15:27] <kushiyakitori> outplayed 

[15:27] <katastrophe> Damn why must I work and make money for it dspPepe 
[15:27] <thatanonyraccoon> @aes0411 i think DSP expects to be the one 
doing the surrounding 

[15:27] <galileopumpkins> @kinggoken He does this as a living. 

[15:27] <wxrxaxtxh> @KushiYakitori tell em 
[15:27] <goldencolts> to live is to struggle dspPepe 
[15:28] <kinggoken> lol. You got me there Sgalileopumpkins 
[15:28] <galileopumpkins> haha 

[15:28] <aes0411> @ThatAnonyRaccoon It could happen, but the other option 
can also happen

[15:30] <wint3rmu7e> someone had to fill that void 

[15:30] <ccous666> what company knows what there doing? plz tell me 
[15:30] <cbvcalifloydian> @ uprightrat Because the gameplay and 
commentary is uninteresting 

[15:30] <djrunol> @Katastrophe doesnt really matter, doesnt make driving 

shotgun less fun if drifting through a quarry

carbonated? i dont get the appeal 

[16:27] <thatanonyraccoon> @Pinkdam it's like soda pop without the 
flavoring, carbonated water 

[16:27] <pinkdam> talk about a waste of money, or does the tap water suck 
where phil is?

upset stomach doesn't settle it? dspHm

[16:44] <bammbino> holy spray and pray 
[16:44] <chenndesu> controller with no aim assist 
[16:44] <chenndesu> makes stuff hard 

[16:44] <darthradovanviking> i think that will be as fair as calling you 
a knights templar @BeTheLewd 

[16:44] <bentboxer> we are the little fingers quadruplets 

[16:44] <oooooar> lol funny how he complains about aim assist in other 

games but he actually needs it ; p

it pulls his aim to the left or right instead of going where he wants it 
[16:46] <wxrxaxtxh> WAUU DUDE 

[16:46] <oooooar> thats called aim assist lmao
