[11:23] <kingofhypocrisy> Chris was sperging out hard, total internet tough guy 

[11:28] <bethelewd> hope jimbob comes to stream today we need to bet on how many times phil will fail at 
PUBG :D 

[11:28] <deepdrive3254> :D 

[11:28] <bethelewd> hello deep 

[11:28] <deepdrive3254> hello there bethe 

[11:28] <bethelewd> danzBatTAS 

[11:29] <kingofhypocrisy> 2 minutes to till stream 

[11:29] <kingofhypocrisy> 1 minute 

[11:29] <deepdrive3254> nice bat emote 

[11:29] <blacktemplar2252> Hey Bethe can I bet on how long before DSP blames the devs lol 

[11:29] <bethelewd> danzBane 

[11:30] <bethelewd> blacktemplar lol sure 

[11:30] <kingofhypocrisy> Better hope Philipo doesn't ban u himself tho 
[11:30] <media_snob> Afternoon fellow stains on society. 

[11:30] <blacktemplar2252> @KingOfHypocrisy Oh I'm just doing it in chat lol, if he bans me it's because he is 
anti-fun lol 

[11:30] <deepdrive3254> well the devs had to apologize for rampant cheating in the game a while ago 
[11:31] <bethelewd> that was the pc version 

[11:31] <blacktemplar2252> @deepdrive3254 Yeah but they constantly ban accounts daily on PC, besides we all 

know PC is the better PUBG 

[11:31] <bethelewd> this is console totally different 

[11:31] <deepdrive3254> pc is better because theres more cheaters? suuuuure 

[11:32] <kingofhypocrisy> @BlackTemplar2252 yeah but sometimes Phil isn't in the mood for fun... 

fuuuuuuunnnnnn 

[11:32] <deepdrive3254> yeah this should be better 

[11:32] <blacktemplar2252> @deepdrive3254 No PC is better because there is better hardware and just in 
general better 

[11:32] <bethelewd> deep of course pc gamers are cheaters we all know consoles gamers dont cheat 

[11:32] <blacktemplar2252> If Phil went on PC he would get destroyed 

[11:32] <blacktemplar2252> @BeTheLewd LuL thats funny 

[11:32] <bethelewd> dont start fighter over pc vs console please 

[11:33] <bethelewd> i wasnt serious anyway 

[11:33] <blacktemplar2252> For some games PC is better others it's Console. PUBG is just better on PC 

[11:33] <blacktemplar2252> Oh I know Bethe just giving my 2 cents 

[11:33] <bethelewd> pubg was made for pc 

[11:33] <bethelewd> it only got ported to xbone cause microsoft 

[11:34] <bethelewd> the fuck was that kekon 

[11:34] <kingofhypocrisy> PC gamers are elitist nudniks dood, like, I used to be one of you! 



[11:35] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:35] <darksydephil> got some great news today folks 
[11:35] <deepdrive3254> we need more games ported to linux 
[11:35] <deepdrive3254> hey phil 

[11:35] <bethelewd> i always been a playstation guy so i dont know about switch, pc or xbone hey phil 

[11:35] <blacktemplar2252> I don't play PC that much. More XBONE. But I know PUBG should be played on 

PC and the caliber of gamer on PC is better than Console 

[11:35] <bethelewd> GOOD NEWS WOOOO 

[11:35] <kingofhypocrisy> the patreon thing got reveresed ? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> yes, the Patreon backlash has totally destroyed their bullshit 
[11:35] <darksydephil> and they are not doing the changes 
[11:35] <blacktemplar2252> For now 
[11:35] <kingofhypocrisy> nice 

[11:35] <darksydephil> so many people lost tons of Patrons over it they had to backpedal 
[11:36] <blacktemplar2252> They said they were looking at it to tweek it 
[11:36] <kingofhypocrisy> good thing they listened unlike youtube 

[11:36] <darksydephil> so this might save the MGS goal, which honestly i was pretty scared about especially be 

i really need the help this month 

[11:36] <bethelewd> youtube are like FUCK YOU 

[11:36] <bethelewd> patreon is like OH SHIT SORRY GUYS 

[11:36] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil Still a long way to go yet 

[11:36] <mattty3888> yeah the news..politcal shows are pissed about paterron too phil 

[11:37] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil Wouldn’t count your chickens just yet lol 

[11:37] <bethelewd> metal gear solid needs to be played regardless of patreon 

[11:37] <blacktemplar2252> Maybe on Hard mode 

[11:38] <blacktemplar2252> As it was played on Normal years ago. Gives it some freshness 
[11:38] <darksydephil> maybe, just maybe, you can stop with that stupid shit lol 

[11:38] <kingofhypocrisy> Patreon probably saw all the money they were losing and that's why they changed 
their mind lol 

[11:38] <darksydephil> im not playing it on hard mode, and anyone who demands that is a moron, sorry, it's just 
true 

[11:38] <darksydephil> i need to play the game for real once before i go on extra challenging runs 
[11:38] <darksydephil> thats like saying well Phil played Dark Souls once, so play it on hard the second time 
[11:38] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil I wasn't demanding anything, I was just stating an option you could 
take 

[11:39] <darksydephil> the option is stupid, so stop stating it 
[11:39] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil Hmm interesting 

[11:39] <kingofhypocrisy> @DarksydePhil You should make a Patreon goal where you play games on the 
hardest difficulty first time around. People would love it 

[11:39] <mujtabal2321> even if patreon takes back the fee changes, how are they gonna get the people who 
dropped their pledges to come back? 

[11:39] <bethelewd> kekon you HAVE to listen to it 

[11:40] <darksydephil> mujtaba 12321 : of course that now lies on the creators, which isn't fair 
[11:40] <darksydephil> i already lost a few 
[11:40] <darksydephil> not too many luckily 

[11:40] <mattty3888> why isnt there a alternative to patreon out there? 

[11:40] <theycallmejimbob> kekon VoHiYo 
[11:40] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello dspHmm 

[11:40] <f_on_yo_bit> @DarksydePhil these dudes just trying to troll bro dont let them get to you 

[11:40] <darksydephil> by the way, since i've heard this game runs like utter shit on xbox one, im only recording

[11:42] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi deep 

[11:42] <darksydephil> the game is apparently a huge mess, which isn't surprising considering the game was 

never even optimized on PC

[11:42] <deepdrive3254> hey there delta 

[11:42] <bethelewd> danzRword kekon

bandwagon that i’m checking it out regardless 

[11:42] <blacktemplar2252> What game we talking about? @DarksydePhil 

[11:42] <ziibrah> I got a custom notification on my phone for your stream lo 

[11:42] <calle7112> @DarksydePhil Hope you'll enjoy very bad framerate, dude 

[11:42] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil Runs fine on PC not sure how Console handles it 

[11:42] <critical_for_d4ys> @DarksydePhil hope you have fun in the game then :)

[11:44] <reggarzl> @DarksydePhil it runs fine on PC nowdays

going to play The End is Nigh? It is from the same creators as Super Meat Boy 

[11:44] <shlnn> PC version also runs like trash

doing things to em, not for real but that is just his character lol

[11:50] <retrocerverus> dspCowboy 

[11:50] <thenewfaceofcreation> Hi @WxRxAxTxH 

[11:50] <thenewfaceofcreation> Dood 

[11:50] <timboslicegb> this game dont even look that good on pc 
[11:50] <reggarzl> It's a slowass AMD chip based on Bulldozer arch 
[11:50] <reggarzl> so yes, it's trash 

[11:50] <glorytobeh> @BlackTemplar2252 anything with an AMD cpu cannot be a gaming pc lol 
[11:50] <wxrxaxtxh> @TheNewFaceofCreation hi dooooooood 

[11:50] <bethelewd> jim yeah most channels do that they have a bunch for 5 dollars and one for tier 2 and 1 for 
tier 3 

[11:50] <theycallmejimbob> hey WxRxAxTxH 

[11:50] <shlnn> he dont care about this game and you want him to buy a PC just to play it with "playable" fps 

[11:50] <shlnn> lrnao 

[11:50] <rx93gundamm> i prefer a 

[11:50] <blacktemplar2252> @Glorytobeh True lol really should upgrade but alas no funds 

[11:50] <theycallmejimbob> that laugh :D 

[11:50] <timboslicegb> reg so why cant xbox x run it better? 

[11:50] <tantamounter> LuL 
[11:51] <shlnn> coz devs are trash 

[11:51] <reggarzl> the Xbxox One X has a faster clocked CPU 

[11:51] <markv777> ach ach ach ach ach lol 

[11:51] <reggarzl> 2.1Ghz on the X, vs 1.6Ghz on the base 

[11:51] <bethelewd> jim you missed a drunksydephil play cod 2 nights ago and you missed the resii 7 dies last 
night 

[11:51] <wxrxaxtxh> sounds like a seal choking 
[11:51] <lokizarro> Ah ah ah ah ah 

[11:51] <timboslicegb> reg the real reason is the devs are trssh 

[11:51] <glorytobeh> Man those mixes are good no joke 

[11:51] <theycallmejimbob> BeTheLewd didn’t he stream at 4am dspShock 

[11:51] <timboslicegb> and seeinf itd beta on xbox they habe no reason to agree with thst 

[11:51] <shlnn> XBO runs games like GTA V, Fortnite and Wildlands no problem and they looks way better 

than PUBG 

[11:51] <reggarzl> I'm not sure why anyone expected a game that was built for PC to run well on a console 
[11:51] <darksydephil> the game is unoptimized and unfinished everywhere, so you cant really blame hardware 
here, why even release it on a console they know cant handle it? answer: greed. 

[11:51] <bethelewd> yes jim i woke up early 
[11:51] <blackdongfilp> sup phil 
[11:52] <timboslicegb> phil it even sucks on xbox one x 
[11:52] <glorytobeh> dsp saying like it is gentlemen 

[11:52] <reggarzl> @DarksydePhil the newest PC patch runs great, I get ~1 lOfps where I got ~40 at launch 
[11:52] <purplekushblunt> You need to do this before xmas, go to your loved ones and state calmly: Guys I’m 
done with the shit consoles, I want a PC 

[11:52] <theycallmejimbob> well it's still in early access on steam surprised they released it on console 
[11:52] <royaUknights> True 
[11:52] <chickendinner_91> Hello all 

[11:52] <mrjekylll6> I love how it's always blaming tehe console when the game has to be optimized aswell. 

[11:52] <theycallmejimbob> damn you madman BeTheLewd dspShock 

[11:52] <bethelewd> its a pc game which means MICROSOFT and xbone is MICROSOFT 

[11:52] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil You clearly haven’t been watching the right people on PC then lol 

[11:52] <mrjekylll6> @DarksydePhil Exactly 

[11:52] <timboslicegb> they call me nope its vl now on px 

[11:52] <theycallmejimbob> hey ChickenDinner_91 KonCha

[11:52] <chickendinner_91> Heyjimbob KonCha 

[11:53] <bethelewd> jim thats right, me and coon have got married and made out a lot just ask delta 

[11:53] <critical_for_d4ys> cheer30 Alot of people are confused including me between valid criticism and just 

plain hate. Could you explain the difference between those two thing. Have a nice stream :) 

[11:53] <blackdongfilp> phil your a great singer 

[11:53] <shlnn> its not even a gam, ist just one map and it looks and runs like garbage 

[11:53] <reggarzl> BeTheLewd because all PC Games are Microsoft games right? FailFish 

[11:53] <timboslicegb> @blacktemplar2252 alot of pubg player admits this game is trash and needs alot of work 

[11:53] <theycallmejimbob> my bad timboslicegb it says on the steam page it's in early access 

[11:53] <ronmexicooo> I have a strong feeling phil will hate this game 

[11:53] <thatbritishlad_> How much is battlegrounds on the xbox? 

[11:53] <aproxymate> Man playing pubg on regular Xbox one will be an ordeal

[11:58] <vendatus> The new Battlefront 2 story is out LUL 

[11:58] <deepdrive3254> five nights at freddys was a hit a while back 

[11:58] <thenewfaceofcreation> Where is undertale genocide

[11:58] <wxrxaxtxh> DSP is gonna get stream sniped

[11:58] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> DSP Hype 

[11:58] <bethelewd> phil got himself a fiery redhead those are keepers also feisty 
[11:58] <chickendinner_91> Phil needs a squad 
[11:58] <blacktemplar2252> It's not duo based 



[11:58] <retrocerverus> Truok 2 or Resident Evil Deadaim 

[11:58] <mxavier91> Do y'all think PUBG is Game of the Year Worthy???? 

[11:58] <sethl89> hell no 

[11:58] <masterswielder> no 

[11:58] <kickass5> Hello Phil how you doing? 

[11:58] <arcticsurface> LOL no 
[11:58] <wxrxaxtxh> yes 

[11:58] <sethl89> its fun but no where near GOTY 
[11:58] <eazybayke> it's trash TekkenLili 
[11:58] <theaveragejoe2> No. Too unoptimized. 

[11:58] <bethelewd> deep did you know five nights at freddys has 6 games now 

[11:59] <deepdrive3254> i thought gingers had no souls Kappa 

[11:59] <ronmexicooo> Game is horribly optimized but alot of fun 

[11:59] <concretecasket> I agree with seth 

[11:59] <retrocerverus> DansGame Endless TRASH!!!! 

[11:59] <deepdrive3254> WAU bethe 

[11:59] <thatbritishlad_> nowhere near goty lol 

[11:59] <deepdrive3254> 6??? 

[11:59] <sethl89> yes 

[11:59] <vendatus> over Zelda yes but Mario should've won LUL 
[11:59] <bethelewd> deep fuck ya for sayin that 
[11:59] <sethl89> u smart 
[11:59] <ronmexicooo> Snub? Its a pre release? 

[11:59] <bethelewd> deep yup 

[11:59] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Zelda as goty is questionable though 
[11:59] <wxrxaxtxh> TONS 

[11:59] <deepdrive3254> I didn’t even play 1 of them damn 
[11:59] <bobbi_ling> play 7 days to die instead OpieOP 
[11:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> Tons doos 
[11:59] <arcticsurface> Cuphead is my GOTY 
[11:59] <thenewfaceofcreation> Nah. 

[11:59] <ronmexicooo> Maybe like 6 months too late LUL 

[12:00] <thefryguy88> Thank god it didn’t win. There’s no scenario where a game thats still in early access 
should win GOTY. That is just a ridiculous notion. 

[12:00] <bobbi_ling> baeoh goty 
[12:00] <sethl89> it destroys the cpu 

[12:00] <infinitc_spherc> the game runs terribly on xbox LUL 
[12:00] <sethl89> aye dat me ;) 

[12:00] <infinitc_spherc> bad controls too LUL 

[12:00] <willyzizz> the live servers are still trash...test servers are way better 

[12:00] <deepdrive3254> we gotta love our fellow red heads though 

[12:00] <chickendinner_91> PUBG ran like trash on my PC until I put it on an SSD 

[12:00] <blackdongfilp> dare i say it som bugged mechanics 

[12:00] <thenewfaceofcreation> Pc 

[12:00] <retrocerverus> LL9 would be nice 

[12:00] <vendatus> #LucktheOscars I'm very passionate, my game has no loot box bs like EAs, devs fuck up 
LUL 

[12:00] <markv777> @Infinite_Sphere You mean the Xbox One, not the Xbox One X 
[12:00] <succkonlemon> still lagy af on pc LUL 

[12:00] <sethl89> he should update his pc like fr phil u missing out on games homie 

[12:00] <infinite_sphere> @markv777 both!! LUL 

[12:01] <blacktemplar2252> @Sethl89 No money to upgrade it 



[12:01] <sethl89> it runs just as abd on x homie LUL 
[12:01] <infinite_sphere> ONE map LUL 
[12:01] <ronmexicooo> Pubg ReisdentSleeper 

[12:01] <theaveragejoe2> and it'll probably stay in early access for years tbh 
[12:01] <sethl89> true i guess 

[12:01] <thepastryarchy> You're probably going to want to PC it after all, cuz the Xbox version is traaaaaaash :D 

[12:01] <thatbritishlad_> 30 bucks for an unfinished game EleGiggle 

[12:01] <zukyun> 30 bucks to be a beta tester 

[12:01] <willyzizz> it officially releases the 20th o pc 

[12:01] <vendatus> Yet it has a Physical disc LUL 

[12:01] <chickendinner_91> You should go on PC anyway LOL, the better version 
[12:01] <infinite_sphere> gamers are SHEEP... FACT! 

[12:01] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> How long was Minecraft in beta? 

[12:02] <markymark52> Well, it's not regular retail. Could be $60.00 

[12:02] <little_blake> minecraft 

[12:02] <ronmexicooo> Dayz 

[12:02] <infinite_sphere> EleGiggle 

[12:02] <concretecasket> haha yes @ThatBritishLad_ 

[12:02] <thatbritishlad_> looks like a free to play game 

[12:02] <vendatus> It is out I thought LUL 

[12:02] <onlinecombosonly> Its always going to cost 30 

[12:02] <bethelewd> jim you see eastenders though at the max shit 

[12:02] <bobbi_ling> pubg makes me ResidentSleeper 

[12:02] <sanvilla93> Is Phil making excuses when he rage quit? 

[12:03] <shlnn> Fortnite looks way better runs better and its F2P 
[12:03] <blackdongfilp> only kojima put out finished games 
[12:03] <kickass5> @DarksydePhil whats your opinion on CSGO? 

[12:03] <retrocerverus> DxCat phil get ur pastaThat rehdy we GTChimp into the nite dspSurpriseddsp 
[12:03] <blacktemplar2252> Lol I wanna say something but I don't wanna get banned 
[12:03] <infinite_sphere> EleGiggle 
[12:03] <eazybayke> 11 FPS TekkenLili 

[12:03] <wxrxaxtxh> im playing on xbox one, its buggy and choppy as fuck 

[12:03] <concretecasket> its like the more money they make in early access the longer it takes to release 
[12:03] <markymark52> I’m sure it doesn't run that low on the Xbox One X 
[12:03] <zukyun> e sport ready 

[12:03] <bethelewd> bobbi it makes me ResidentSleeper too 
[12:03] <thenewfaceofcreation> Dont play it if the frame is awful 
[12:03] <tomahawkings> Slideshow phil 

[12:03] <thefryguy88> PC is by far the best experience but it runs like shit on pc too. It's poorly optimized. 

[12:04] <bethelewd> fuck the xbone x 

[12:04] <clunkyd> The devs are complete trash 

[12:04] <snarfu99> Why doesn't he Play it at least on Xbox One X? 

[12:04] <radicalenzyme> The developers of pubg did not port it was Microsoft (who worked with a Spanish 
studio) 

[12:04] <jamison77> Xboxl is dogshit you knew this Phill remember dark souls 3 

[12:04] <onlinecombosonly> Pubg will be full release on the 20th for PC 

[12:04] <sethl89> Bethe knows what's up 

[12:04] <succkonlemon> fucking blueballs sucks LUL 

[12:04] <tubzbuster> Microsoft are the ones porting the game 

[12:04] <thenewfaceofcreation> @WxRxAxTxH so much for the "best" consele dood 

[12:04] <kekon3> if this doesn't work out on consoles , it's good to remind everyone Fortnite is always free and 
infinitely more stable :) muxylO 



[12:04] <arcticsurface> The reasoning doesnt hold up because the game looks like shit, no mind blowing 
graphics or something. 

[12:04] <lokizarro> It's down to both really 

[12:04] <blacktemplar2252> @DarksydePhil It was Microsoft who ported the game not the DEVS of PUBG 
[12:04] <blackdongfilp> phil x deveplopers 

[12:04] <lokizarro> More so the devs I guess in the case of the original Xbone 

[12:04] <sethl89> the fury my pc runs it fine on med-high 

[12:04] <vendatus> We Happy Few is $60 on the xbox store WutFace 

[12:04] <bethelewd> kekon and on ps4 

[12:04] <wxrxaxtxh> @TheNewFaceofCreation sux dood 

[12:05] <chickendinner_91> Most of my PC settings are on low, textures on high 

[12:05] <stuart360> Its good that they got the game running at all on the consoles, it runs like shit on my PC and 

my CPU is sooo far beyond whats in the consoles 

[12:05] <infinite_sphere> EleGiggle 

[12:05] <eazybayke> TekkenLili 

[12:05] <thenewfaceofcreation> Lol 

[12:05] <e46johnny> I bought thos crap 

[12:05] <shlnn> No it was Bluehole who ported it on XBO, Coalition only helped them 
[12:05] <chickendinner_91> lol 
[12:05] <sethl89> black ur stupid 
[12:05] <little_blake> so did they port it? 

[12:05] <clunkyd> BlackTem, the devs are trash! 

[12:05] <katexo234> dspSurpriseddsp 

[12:05] <stunted> microsoft ported the game 6Y~,5Y~,5Y~, 

[12:05] <exkeine> i love u dsp 
[12:05] <wxrxaxtxh> Omg 

[12:05] <markv777> Yeah I agree with Phil, devs are the responsible 

[12:05] <mrjekylll6> Exactly, it's not always the console his fault. It's always Microsoft sucks, Sony is Trash. 
[12:05] <aes0411> If PUBG on the Xbox One is anything like WWE 2K18 on the Switch, then we are in for a 
treat #rage 

[12:05] <thenewfaceofcreation> Wau 

[12:05] <clunkyd> a game that looks like last gen and runs like shit, pathetic 

[12:05] <theaveragejoe2> hollyjolly 

[12:05] <bobbi_ling> fanboys in 2017 

[12:05] <timboslicegb> the devs suck at porting 

[12:05] <chickendinner_91> Cahmaaan 

[12:05] <onlinecombosonly> I thought this was a positive month 
[12:05] <bethelewd> kate the bet in on me vs jimbob 30 deaths 
[12:05] <majestic_seven> So when does the game start 
[12:05] <little_blake> so did microsoft port it or nah? 

[12:05] <superblue555> is he going to play the ex layer beta? wait never mind probably not s goof idea 
[12:05] <zukyun> current year 

[12:05] <lokizarro> Both are responsible tbh because MS allow it 
[12:05] <agoodrpg> lol 

[12:05] <stuart360> It is Early Access though Phil, and they have said they will fix the game. Still runs like shit 
though 

[12:05] <chomchamp> @darksydephil I agreee but i am not a whiny baby 
[12:05] <chickendinner_91> PUBG team sucks 
[12:05] <deepdrive3254> i thought it was 20 bethe? 

[12:05] <clunkyd> the devs suck in general 

[12:05] <bethelewd> not 30 

[12:05] <shlnn> microsoft didnt port it 



[12:06] <bethelewd> 29 

[12:06] <blacktemplar2252> You are already wanting to hate it in your chat lol 
[12:06] <katexo234> 30 deaths PogChamp PogChamp 
[12:06] <bethelewd> 20 

[12:06] <ringleadermanl3> it wont be different next year haha 

[12:06] <ronmexicooo> Good luck, brace for rage stream boys 

[12:06] <stunted> phil you shoukd really do some research before you slam a game 

[12:06] <aproxymate> Phil shouldn’t mock fans 

[12:06] <bethelewd> IM BLIND 

[12:06] <deepdrive3254> oh ok 

[12:06] <little_blake> new year is not gaonna change anything 
[12:06] <vendatus> 3 weeks? 

[12:06] <markymark52> cheer 10 You're running on the oldest version of the Xbox One so people have a reason 
to complain. 

[12:06] <madranel> Are there any french people watching Phil ? 

[12:06] <e46johnny> textures dont load until 5 minutes after you land 
[12:06] <arcticsurface> Its been going since years LOL 
[12:06] <succkonlemon> 2017 early access shitty games 
[12:06] <sethl89> black tmeplar u are a huge fanboy, chill homie 
[12:06] <aes0411> PUBG is garbage. Defend it. Come on 

[12:06] <wxrxaxtxh> the game is choppy as hell, good luck killing someone at 12fps 

[12:06] <omgzelda> oh god PUBg on console lol 

[12:06] <markv777> triggered fanboys already? jeezus 

[12:06] <timboslicegb> it is still in beta but still 

[12:06] <katexo234> well happy Wednesday eveyone 

[12:06] <mrjekylll6> The devs with help from the coalition are who ported it. 

[12:06] <blacktemplar2252> @Sethl89 Fan boy of what PUBG? I've played it once lol 

[12:06] <sethl89> mark it runs as bad on the x 

[12:06] <blacktemplar2252> @Sethl89 Relax whiteknight 

[12:06] <me_god> those sayin "it's still early access" have no idea, the game is playable on PC. 

[12:06] <dredmasrer989> that next yeat comment is sketch 

[12:06] <shlnn> PUBG is dog shit, a dog shit that cost 30$. yea defend it 

[12:06] <sethl89> then why u defending it so hard? 

[12:06] <aproxymate> @blacktemplar2252 you tell em 
[12:07] <tomahawkings> $10 phil wins his first match 
[12:07] <me_god> hlzl came kinda first 

[12:07] <stuart360> Why are Sony fanboys making a deal out of this?, it would run even worse on PS4 due to 
the lower cpu clock 

[12:07] <vendatus> Fortnite is better LUL 
[12:07] <onlinecombosonly> pubg was a anna mod years ago 
[12:07] <sethl89> if phil weins his first game ill donate 100 bucks 
[12:07] <kushuluck> Fortnite LUL 

[12:07] <blacktemplar2252> @stuart360 Cause it's SONY lol 
[12:07] <markv777> @stuart360 thank you 
[12:07] <timboslicegb> there is bigger story behind it phil 
[12:07] <chomchamp> true 

[12:07] <thefryguy88> Fortnite is way better it's free and it runs really well and seems to be quite stable 
[12:07] <chickendinner_91> Phil needs to get a squad, then it helps a lot 

[12:07] <theaveragejoe2> @me_god The reason people are saying it's early access is 'cause it IS early access. 

You can look at the steam store page. 

[12:07] <thatbritishlad_> It’s another Flappy Birds scenerio, such a basic idea gone so popular by sheep. 

[12:07] <madranel> What do you preferr 



[12:07] <i_came_here_to_something> This game runs like sloppy ass on Xbox One X, it's probably unplayable 

on Phil’s regular Xbox 

[12:07] <ironjargon> late to the party 

[12:07] <bethelewd> but ps4 runs better than xbone though 

[12:07] <timboslicegb> devs of fortenite worked on pubg 

[12:07] <thenewfaceofcreation> All day eh 

[12:07] <blackdongfilp> oh shiet 

[12:07] <kozatof> Hmmmm 

[12:08] <kekon3> Fortnite has a 50 vs 50 mode now, it's p cool 
[12:08] <blacktemplar2252> Bet he drops it lol 

[12:08] <primefivebyfive> It runs like shit, but is still a lot of fun. Would still advise anyone to wait for a 
finished version though. 

[12:08] <thenewfaceofcreation> Salt for a day 
[12:08] <kozatof> Good luck with 15 FPS 
[12:08] <bobbi_ling> beth stop 
[12:08] <thenewfaceofcreation> Good 
[12:08] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> dspCowboy 
[12:08] <bobbi_ling> right now 

[12:08] <stuart360> Actually it runs at a pretty solid 30fps on the X, its just the hub area and skydive that run 
like shit 

[12:08] <chickendinner_91> I bet he ragequits because of shitty performance on his console LOL 
[12:08] <bethelewd> bobbi be nice 

[12:08] <cutiebaee> Hi guys Do you want to get rid of the skins? Use my code @KRA1N for 10$ money 
opencsgocom 

[12:08] <arcticsurface> Its time for slideshows 
[12:08] <shlnn> dont blame consoles, blame the devs 

[12:08] <i_came_here_to_something> @kozatof Try 5-10. He's on reg Xbox, not X 
[12:08] <retrocerverus> Isn't this game like minecraft and Team Fortress

[12:08] <mrjekylll6> This isn't a console problem. Please the game is UNOPTIMIZED. 

[12:09] <tomahawkings> Donkey shit is actually really nice

[14:17] <bethebaby> @fabulousfabricant This game DOES have performance issues, though. Even people with 
1080ti's on PC have reported awful performance. 

[14:17] <geddisrespect> First blue is weak

[14:18] <xtaker> Lmao triangle 

[14:18] <pcgamehunter> @Madranel MingLee 

[14:18] <zahvone> Guys, this game isn’t even optimized in the slightest. Almost no one gets a constant 30fps 
even on PC. 

[14:18] <bethebaby> "I don't know how to do that" * immediately does it* 

[14:18] <theycallmejimbob> :D 

[14:18] <the_bitty> I don't think you could runn as a non idiot:) 

[14:18] <jmon_1985> hes gonna get popped with no weapon in hand 

[14:18] <darkciders> you can dewwwww it Phil 

[14:18] <sethl89> Zah that is not true at all homie 

[14:18] <eternia_forever> can he will he 

[14:18] <encelor> vsync off LUL 

[14:18] <bethelewd> so phil would cheat 

[14:18] <retrocerverus> the time travel zombie dinos came in 

[14:18] <elzorrobot> @danters3 Ah I see, I guess these are becoming hybrids now adays 
[14:18] <zahvone> @Sethl89 How is that not true? lol 

[14:18] <takisq> thats a a lie @Zahvone it might not be optimized but 30fps is a lie 
[14:18] <plushymeme> HSWP 

[14:18] <stunted> @Zahvone are you trolling or what? 

[14:18] <zahvone> Kappa 



[14:18] <tupakaveli> You know there isnt no aim assist, right 
[14:18] <admiralprawn> It's much worse on consoles, like most games. 

[14:18] <eternia_forever> its not cheating if Phil does it sheesh @BeTheLewd 
[14:18] <captcaveman4201> when it blinks you go into a different dimention 
[14:19] <sethl89> because even this game can run on pc without as many problems 
[14:19] <vendatus> not cheating bethe it's a mechanic LUL 
[14:19] <me_god> this runs at least at 40fps on ok pcs 

[14:19] <fabulousfabricant> @bethebaby For the longest time it wasn't even technically in release. It was an 
early access game and it felt like it. But it was still enjoyable, especially given the rather small team behind it. 
[14:19] <sethl89> i get 70 fps on med-high and i only have an above average pc 
[14:19] <zahvone> Oh, no it definitely can run well. I'm not saying it doesn’t / won’t. 

[14:19] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil dont give up so early lol 

[14:19] <mgtow_nofap> i thought pc users say this game is super unoptimized 

[14:19] <zahvone> Just that a large majority of players still aren't able to really even hit a consistent 30. 
[14:19] <theravenger01> I get 100+FPS @at 1080p 
[14:19] <allthecheeses> Adjust your sensitivity playa phil 

[14:19] <xtaker> No aim assist is going to mess up phil. Hea€™s too used to COD shooting games 
[14:19] <madranel> @DarksydePhil Take off your shoes to make less noise 
[14:19] <mgtow_nofap> @sethl89 what graphics card?

[14:19] <aireo_> Solid Phill Snake PogChamp KappaRoss 

[14:19] <pcgamehunter> Theres way too much running to have a stamina bar MingLee 

[14:19] <me_god> unoptimized on pc = goes below 60 from time to time 

[14:19] <danters3> but guys THE CIRCLE 

[14:19] <sethl89> my friend can get above 60 on a 750ti if that tells you a lot of poeple can run it 
[14:19] <takisq> u just said it doesnt run even on 30fps now u r saying it can run well @Zahvone 
[14:20] <allthecheeses> Go in that house# 

[14:20] <elzorrobot> is this like shadow of Chernobyl 
[14:20] <aireo_> @danters3 no 
[14:20] <allthecheeses> Ita€™s a trap 
[14:20] <geddisrespect> Ita€™s a bad gun.. 

[14:20] <zahvone> @TakiSQ I never said it DIDN'T. I said most people can't hit a CONSTANT 30. 

[14:20] <encelor> its looted 

[14:20] <markymark52> Had Phil gotten a vehicle yet? 

[14:20] <eternia_forever> top 50 

[14:20] <stunted> Zahvone is talking out his ass ignore him 
[14:20] <encelor> doors open = looted 
[14:20] <danters3> @aireo_ DansGame 

[14:20] <zahvone> Of course it can run well, clearly streamers are able to run it at higher framerate. :P 

[14:20] <mgtow_nofap> shitter 

[14:20] <takisq> cant hit 30 fps = doesnt run 30fps 

[14:20] <theycallmejimbob> he did in the last round markymark52

[14:21] <zahvone> @Stunted I'm not exactly sure why you're so upset by this. It doesn't affect you in the 
slightest. I'm not even bashing the game. 

[14:21] <the_bitty> 50 is not top. lol 

[14:21] <zahvone> In fact, I was defending the game. 

[14:21] <admiralprawn> @DarksydePhil I’d like to see you play this on PC. 

[14:21] <mgtow_nofap> should they make games more realistic in future where you'll have to take shit or pee 
breaks or you'll feel uncomfortable or get anxiety and start losing health 

[14:21] <me_god> when near buildings, crouch 

[14:21] <takisq> by saying it runs like ass?

[14:22] <eternia_forever> well the sane man has made it @theycallmejimbob 

[14:22] <zahvone> Either way, stop being so offended. You're not the developers, and I do enjoy this game. 
[14:22] <young_wobblez> Will Phil ever go back to Injustice 2 to play as The Ninja Turtles?

[14:22] <stunted> @Zahvone yeah thought not 

[14:22] <sethl89> if a 30-50 graphics card can allow people to get at least 60 then id say its not hard to make it 
run well

[14:22] <zybatzuu> Lol good question where is everyone Phil is suicide playing right now and not getting 

punished for it 

[14:22] <pcgamehunter> For the 7th time the game isn’t even released they can't optimize and then add shit, it's 
not how it work FailFish 



[14:22] <bethebaby> @NickyRickyDickyandDawn95 God I hope so. Playing this in 3rd person is like playing

[14:46] <fr333stylin> Tap LT to ADS 
[14:46] <hablb> no you cant 

[14:46] <xaxtonrevolution> @bethebaby I think they might've just called it PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds 
instead of Battlegrounds so that they could lie and say that PlayerUnknown is the name of some well-known 
game developer and generate false hypee 
[14:46] <newmustard> Oh no. Horror as Phil dumps good kit... 

[14:46] <vashon91> WOOOOO phil is back on! 

[14:46] <eternia_forever> he did it 
[14:46] <taniaraven> INCOMING 
[14:46] <sethl89> ur dumb 

[14:46] <hablb> read the patch notes where they changed that 
[14:46] <sethl89> bad b8m8 
[14:47] <hablb> like 2 months ago 

[14:47] <lastkryptonian94> cheer 100 I think you came at this game with the wrong mindset. The fun comes from 
the tension. It's more of a slow build up to short bursts of chaos than constant action. 

[14:47] <sethl89> i played it yesterday and almost died to it 

[14:47] <zahvone> The new software Humble Bundle gives you Sony vegas 14 pro for 20 bucks guys. (Retail is 
400 dollars) 

[14:47] <sethl89> ur shit at b8ing 
[14:47] <hablb> almost. 

[14:47] <dutchvanderlinde> Which Xbox is this? 

[14:47] <baylesstheg0> if phils smart he’ll play this game until its sucked dry 

[14:47] <sethl89> yeah becaue i got downed by a blast

[14:48] <primernova> AKM, no question 
[14:48] <sturbridges> AK can have attachments 

[14:48] <theycallmejimbob> damn Zahvone surprised they added it to a bundle 

[14:48] <encelor> replace tommy with a shotgun @DarksydePhil 

[14:48] <lastkryptonian94> @Elzorrobot Or just learn to have fun in the quiet ment 



[14:48] <kakakakeal> akm because of attachments 
[14:48] <newmustard> Tommy for close, AKM for med 
[14:48] <bobbi_ling> none, go pacifist 
[14:48] <lastkryptonian94> *moments 

[14:48] <suckasurprise> Dirty Bathrooms should have a chance to spawn a pneumatic plunger melee weapon, 
Phil would be a pro with that 

[14:48] <zahvone> @theycallmejimbob If you're interested you need to grab it now before they run out of keys 
wtf 

[14:48] <eternia_forever> top 50 

[14:48] <newmustard> Put attachments on AKM 

[14:48] <mygtisrandom> @DarksydePhil hey bro, tap LT instead of holding it 
[14:48] <infinite_sphere> fortnite 

[14:48] <bethelewd> bobbi he executed a guy he isnt pacifist 
[14:48] <sprank_n> @LastKryptonian94 he get its DOOODD!!! 

[14:48] <infinite_55> mrdestructoidlOO Phil how are you so good at this game. Please tell us your secret!! 

[14:48] <fr333stylin> Tap LT to ADS 

[14:49] <xaxtonrevolution> I think that console game developers should design their games cross platform with 
other consoles and keyboard and mouse support because now you can actually plug your keyboard and mouse 
into your console, that way they'd be just like PCs. 

[14:49] <ass_blastor> @DarksydePhil Change your mode to auto, its on single 

[14:49] <soupysean68> totally gets it sure LUL 

[14:49] <fabulousfabricant> No one said it was revolutionary. 

[14:49] <elzorrobot> @LastKryptonian94 no this game is exactly that 

[14:49] <newmustard> Things like sights are better for the AKM, like red dot and X2 X4 over iron sights. 

[14:49] <sprank_n> @XaxtonRevolution or just buy a pc 

[14:49] <scoopula> cheerlO Welcome back Phil. Glad to see you refreshed. 

[14:49] <b3nkei> LuL 

[14:49] <zahvone> @XaxtonRevolution I actually really enjoy Epic Games' games because of that. You can play 

Fortnite with your PS4 friends while you're on PC, AND voice chat with them 

[14:49] <glorytobeh> deep phil 

[14:49] <mennarch> i was gonna say like life LUL 

[14:49] <bigbunga> FeelsSadMan 

[14:49] <reggieface420> TPFufun stop having fun in my house 

[14:49] <infinite_55> lol 

[14:49] <theravenger01> lol thaat got deep 

[14:49] <zahvone> You can do that with Paragon as well 

[14:49] <kittyspank> the secret 

[14:49] <theycallmejimbob> yeah humble does that regularly they did a freedom bundle last year with 60 games 
and didn’t tell people some of the games had limited keys Zahvone 
[14:49] <theravenger01> that* 

[14:49] <chrisacl989> this game is u believe 
[14:49] <b3nkei> FeelsBadMan 

[14:50] <libertasliber> @DarksydePhil if you have a sight put it on the AK 

[14:50] <zahvone> @theycallmejimbob A lot of the keys get like that. It's owned by IGN now soooo.... 

[14:50] <aloofone> my ears 

[14:50] <chrisacl989> Xbox one version just isn’t optimised enuf yet 
[14:50] <fr333stylin> @DarksydePhil Tap LT to ADS 
[14:50] <bigbunga> kill them fill 

[14:50] <mygtisrandom> @DarksydePhil TAP LT INSTEAD OF HOLDING IT 

[14:50] <zombie_gorilla> just like life 

[14:50] <trueafricanwarrior> Wew 
[14:50] <encelor> 2dar 



[14:50] <chrisacl989> stick to AKM 

[14:50] <dukaduka> @XaxtonRevolution no that's not the answer NotLikeThis they everyone would be playing 
with a mixed bag 

[14:50] <encelor> @DarksydePhil repalce tommygun when you get the chance 
[14:50] <chrisacl989> Tommy gun is only good close range 

[14:50] <theycallmejimbob> the last humble monthly was good imo Zahvone hopefully they wont mess around 
with it too much 

[14:50] <scoopula> Did Phil get any Chicken Dinner yet? 

[14:50] <zahvone> I think cross-platform should be a thing though. Especially for MMO titles. 

[14:50] <xaxtonrevolution> @Sprank_N Or that, but I think PC motherboards should have more modular parts 
and there are too many types of ram. 

[14:50] <taniaraven> Xbox one X runs better 
[14:50] <chrisacl989> use akm 

[14:50] <thewisepolak> @darksydephil they went bonkers for the pc version which is miles ahead of this in both 
performance and gameplay 

[14:50] <sethl89> it probably won’t because itrs a cpu hog and the consoles haver bad cpus i wouldnt expect for 
them to ever reach 60 dont get yalls hopes up 

[14:50] <me_god> phil won the 2nd match 

[14:50] <secretbossfight> @scoopula Second game 

[14:50] <dankedan> So pretty much this game is where most people can just sit and wait in buildings in the 
middle of the circle and let people die 
[14:50] <mennarch> equip a scope on the ak 
[14:50] <infinite_sphere> xbox x LUL 

[14:50] <zahvone> @theycallmejimbob I absolutely love Humble Bundle man. Sadly though, I have over 300 
games that I've never even touched because of them though lol 

[14:50] <me_god> 0 kills 

[14:51] <kittyspank> AA 
[14:51] <encelor> he got 1 kill 

[14:51] <scoopula> nice I will have to check it out on youtube 
[14:51] <chrisacl989> it's difficult to see far away in this version 
[14:51] <encelor> the afk dude 
[14:51] <sirnoblex> 1 kill 

[14:51] <theycallmejimbob> :D Zahvone I've the same problem too 
[14:51] <djrunol> dude if you want to "chill out" go prone dont crouch 
[14:51] <chrisacl989> this is far better than fortnite 

[14:51] <rocky2636> cheer 10 are you gonna play duos or squads later? If so can I join you? 

[14:51] <tupakaveli> Hold or tap LT and click in left or right stick to lean 
[14:51] <chrisacl989> PC version is fantastic 
[14:51] <infinite_sphere> SUUUUURE 
[14:51] <taniaraven> he killed 2 last game 

[14:51] <fr333stylin> @DarksydePhil Attach scope to AKM + ADS = Lots of kills 

[14:51] <darthradovanviking> isn't there other issues with cross platform as you say. If you have a pc and longer 

draw distance and better graphics that have to be an unfair advantage as well 

[14:51] <sirnoblex> @Chrisacl989 I guess, everyone has that disadvantage so it's fair. 

[14:51] <angrylittlepeople> dood 
[14:51] <bigbunga> BEHIND YOU 

[14:51] <paddingtonbearl87> WHEEEEEYYYY InuyoFace 
[14:51] <bigbunga> SE 

[14:51] <expertpenguin> light years is a stretch...the game still looks pretty bad even on a good pc 
[14:51] <kovorus> I used to be one of you 
[14:51] <angrylittlepeople> Lol he built his pc.... 

[14:51] <reporterincheif> PRO GAMER LUL 



[14:52] <reggieface420> i remember watching those videos of you building the pc 
[14:52] <wxrxaxtxh> ACH 

[14:52] <admiralprawn> How is that PC building coming along, Phil? 

[14:52] <theravenger01> LUL 
[14:52] <angrylittlepeople> dude bought 3k brick 
[14:52] <kittyspank> was that the 90s 
[14:52] <azathothcult> 10k pc 

[14:52] <chrisacl989> I'm playing pc and Xbox one s 

[14:52] <ass_blastor> cheerlO Will you get this game for PC? You have 1230 viewers!! 

[14:52] <kovorus> I used to build gaming pc's as a hobby 

[14:52] <djrunol> when the fuck were you a pc gamer, first there was arcade machines and then there was 
consoles 

[14:52] <encelor> @Ass_Blastor his pc succks 
[14:52] <sprank_n> @Ass_Blastor blast mine please 

[14:52] <xaxtonrevolution> I think the graphics are better on PC and you can get better performance, but I don’t 
thi nk that PCs are for everyone 

[14:52] <legended> @DarksydePhil How do you feel about people who use XIM4? 

[14:52] <theycallmejimbob> :D DJRunol damn 

[14:52] <dirtysanchez012> That story again, you need help to plug a USB phil 
[14:52] <wxrxaxtxh> LMAOO 

[14:52] <admiralprawn> If you were a PC builder, why not stick with the PC? Sounded like you enjoyed it. 
[14:52] <zahvone> @DarthRadovanViking There's definitely an issue with that, for competitive titles and such. I 
don’t think it would matter much for games that focus more on group activities and such 
[14:52] <elzorrobot> boring but better than watching a chess match 
[14:52] <retrocerverus> Residentsleeper 

[14:52] <chrisacl989> PC is difficult, harder to get kills. Xbox one is harder to see enemies in the distance but I 
think it still is a great game even though it doesn’t run as smoothly 

[14:52] <xaxtonrevolution> I like hoard all the parts from all the PCs I have so it's not a good hobby for me to 
have. 

[14:52] <kittyspank> lots of communicating now 

[14:52] <djrunol> @theycalhnejimbob dude how many pc games has he played since he is on yt? 3? 

[14:53] <azathothcult> lost 100 views since guttural belch 

[14:53] <zybatzuu> As far as I know draw distances are the same for everyone no matter what your graphics are 
set at 

[14:53] <oledtvmasterrace> Ita€™d be boring garbage at a billion frames per second and controlled by only your 
thoughts! Streamer bait garbage. 

[14:53] <cheshirezerg> my pc is 7 years old and runs this game just fine 

[14:53] <newmustard> If you land in high density loot areas like School or Military base at the south the game 
play is intense to start - not my cup of tea 

[14:53] <dragonpoison> @DarthRadovanViking draw distance doesn’t draw in players, only textures like trees 
and grass. It is actually better to have lower graphics settings on thing like foiliage and shadows to be able to spot 
players more easily. There is no way to pay for a better computer to win matches in PUBG. 

[14:53] <theravenger01> @DarksydePhil a 780ti and 4930k should run this fine lol 
[14:53] <zybatzuu> In terms of seeing a player 

[14:53] <infinite_sphere> 3 year old pc = outdated, yup. thats why i dont game on pc LUL 
[14:53] <ass_blastor> cheerlO You can try the game on PC and get a refund if its not good 
[14:53] <darthradovanviking> dspHmm 

[14:53] <chrisacl989> gtx 1050ti on medium., looks far better than this

[14:53] <bigbunga> defecate on stream 
[14:53] <bethelewd> fart 

[14:53] <xaxtonrevolution> That's what I like about consoles, they don’t go outdated as often; I'm not saying one 
is better, I'm just saying that that's my preference. 

[14:54] <takisq> it was outated when it was built anyways @Sethl89 

[14:54] <theravenger01> @Sethl89 ikr the most overused myth 

[14:54] <encelor> i kinda doubt he can play it on pc 

[14:54] <theravenger01> against pc 

[14:54] <theycallmejimbob> TwitchCop BeTheLewd 

[14:54] <djrunol> @Chrisacl989 yeah but who buys a 1050ti for gaming? 

[14:54] <espada_92> @Infinite_Sphere xbone and ps4 are already outdated too 

[14:54] <reggieface420> to be fair you've done worse in front of a camera i wouldn’t wanna stir bad memories 

[14:54] <eternia_forever> top 30 jimmy :D @theycallmejimbob

[14:54] <theravenger01> @DarksydePhil Yeah Steam can refund you 

[14:54] <sirnoblex> Steam FTW 

[14:54] <radicalenzyme> @DarksydePhil You can refund steam games if you have played less than 2 hours

[15:06] <legended> @encelor It looks worse on my PC since I run everything on low 
[15:06] <theravenger01> and the fps... 

[15:06] <encelor> zombie ai is terrible too imo xD 

[15:06] <playcooll8> lets be honest guys, most people here (myself included) survive this game by playing like 
cowardly assholes that go slow and wait for others to show up 
[15:06] <theycallmejimbob> 81% approval dspHmm 

[15:07] <newmustard> Berates game for slow game play and runs from fights. Phil has charm. 

[15:07] <brokenpotatol23> use ar 

[15:07] <sethl89> used to be mostly negative, guess it went back up

[15:08] <darkciders> Winnie > Paddington 

[15:08] <ipunchedsanta> Is this on the OG Xbox One or the X ? 

[15:08] <bethelewd> phil needs pants 

[15:08] <dooley258> Does the game run well on the Xbox? 

[15:08] <radicalenzyme> @DarksydePhil Right on d pad to equip granades

[15:08] <theycallmejimbob> the pacifist run VoHiYo 
[15:08] <soupysean68> and the SAME BUILDING LUL 
[15:08] <encelor> uzi only good close range because the fire rate 
[15:08] <lokizarro> Are you liking it? 

[15:08] <theravenger01> Pacifist run confirmed 

[15:08] <lbuttondash> fortnite looked like wow so i uninstalled it the day after i installed 

[15:09] <playcooll8> my gtx750ti (more powerfull than XI gpu) could handle the game on 1080p around 34 fps 

[15:09] <bethelewd> jim this is NOT the run 

[15:09] <bigbunga> yeah go full auto see what happens 

[15:09] <legended> PUBG and Fortnite are completely different games, but the premise is the same 

[15:09] <encelor> @DarksydePhil bandage is to stop bleeding 

[15:09] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe you said that last time too BeTheLewd 

[15:09] <i_came_here_to_something> Fornite girls are thiccer so Fortnite > PUBG 

[15:09] <legended> @DarksydePhil You need to take boosters 

[15:09] <squii> same game, but has no building, has vehicles, has ADS, no weapon rarity tiers forsenThink 5Yn” 
[15:09] <encelor> medikit is for healing 

[15:09] <playcooll8> of course I have a i7 7700k, the cpu is bottlenecking the game on consoles 
[15:09] <brillbrobrubbins> Single shot is way better beyond 50m though 

[15:09] <sethl89> playcool have u tried the test servers?? you should be able to get over 60 on there 
[15:09] <thewisepolak> Dayz is so much more survival oriented disease, food, etc 
[15:09] <gokai_blue> in the PC version you almost NEVER want to use full auto 
[15:09] <squii> yeah basically the same thing SeemsGood 



[15:09] <ipunchedsanta> @darksydephil Are you playing the game on the original Xbox one or Xbox one x ? 
[15:09] <brillbrobrubbins> Automatic is terrible unless you're right in their face 
[15:09] <kushiyakitori> @IPunchedSanta its the original 
[15:09] <elzorrobot> engage 

[15:09] <brillbrobrubbins> in which case, you should be using a shotgun/smg in close quarters 

[15:09] <ass_blastor> @Cheerl0 Can't use bandage if you're more than 75% health. Have to use first aid to make 

it 100%. Drink the energy drinks for adrenaline boost. 

[15:09] <ipunchedsanta> Thanks 

[15:09] <theycallmejimbob> uh oh NotLikeThis 

[15:09] <encelor> @DarksydePhil bandages is for when you get bleed status on you

[15:10] <theycallmejimbob> he survived dspSurpriseddsp 
[15:10] <encelor> @Squii there aint? 

[15:10] <bethelewd> pacifist run is over 
[15:10] <b3nkei> Phil going in PogChamp 

[15:10] <playcooll8> @Sethl89 never tried the test servers, I usually on play this game on my gtx970 since I get 
60fps easily, or more recently I got a 1050ti to replace my old 750ti 
[15:10] <b3nkei> LUL 

[15:10] <butter_my_bread> a 1080p 60 mode for fhe X may be an eventuality to quell the backlash over 

performance, the real hurdle is getting the xbone to run this at an acceptable frame rate, easier said than done 

[15:10] <bigbunga> he's learning guys 

[15:10] <squii> @encelor there is not, have you played? 

[15:10] <brillbrobrubbins> >that ragdoll 
[15:10] <residentevilbeating> wtf XD 
[15:10] <vashon91> yeah 

[15:10] <legended> @DarksydePhil You need to use energy or painkillers to fill your health the rest of the way 
[15:10] <pixlblitz> loot 

[15:10] <bethelewd> he wont win this game he ruined it by killing some one 
[15:10] <vashon91> riddle him with bullets 

[15:10] <dukaduka> keep your omegaluls out of this chat OpieOP 12 years olds 
[15:10] <encelor> @Squii the grey hp aint considered bleeding? 

[15:10] <playcooll8> DSP is doing way better than I did at first 
[15:11] <kittyspank> he is a professional 
[15:11] <steady_now> what sensitivity are u at? 

[15:11] <butter_my_bread> i dont think a 750ti is better than the X’s gpu. 

[15:11] <playcooll8> btw guys is there any key to auto run on consoles? 

[15:11] <madranel> he can be good at games if he wants to 

[15:11] <sethl89> @playcooll8 oh damn lol i got a 970 too! why do u have so many graphics cards lrnao 
[15:11] <radicalenzyme> @DarksydePhil try holding rb while looking around 

[15:11] <squii> @encelor that indicates how much health u can gain via bandages, bandages put you to 75%, 
you need energy drink or painkiller to regen the last 25% 

[15:11] <katastrophe> Braaap 

[15:11] <theravenger01> @Butter_My_Bread The original Xl's gpu 

[15:11] <sethl89> id say its on par 



[15:11] <chucky6460> Stay in the hills not by the water 
[15:11] <sethl89> if not slightly better 

[15:11] <thewisepolak> @darksydephil use drinks and painkillers to fill the rest of your health 
[15:11] <bigbunga> HES LEARNING 
[15:11] <theravenger01> its better 

[15:12] <encelor> @Squii but you lose that grey hp when you don’t bandage it

[15:21] <theravenger01> @playcooll8 True this game is a mess atm. 

[15:21] <retrocerverus> this game seems more like shenanigans 
[15:21] <sprank_n> @LastKryptonian94 you might not realize this Kappa

[15:22] <sethl89> christ ive told him at least 10 times 

[15:22] <playcooll8> @Drilbit777 you can play it with high fps even if you have a low tier gpu, as long as you 

have a great cpu, which I do for encoding purposes, this game only needs 2 cores from mine to go around 55fps, 

console cpus are a joke

[15:22] <lbuttondash> i honestly can't see the hype around this game, graphically it looks like a ps2 game, 
possibly ps3 at best, the framerate always looks like a fuckin sega CD cutscene 
[15:22] <thewisepolak> Not wanting to win sounds like the justification for being not very good lol 
[15:22] <primernova> It's a lot better on PC

[15:24] <wilus84> didn’t expect this to run great on the console 
[15:25] <sethl89> neither did i 

[15:25] <theravenger01> @Sethl89 I know your struggle lol 
[15:25] <brokenpotatol23> it just recently got released tho 

[15:25] <theycallmejimbob> I only recently found out about PS Now EterniaForever that seems to be an 
awesome service. I'm waiting for it to launch here before I get a PS4 
[15:25] <torchl8> But you fought him without a gun. Of course you would lose 
[15:25] <trihard41iife> TriHard 

[15:25] <katastrophe> PUBG just isn’t well optimized on ANYTHING, PC or otherwise. Therefore any 

argument on performance on this v that is null and void LUL 

[15:25] <elzorrobot> I think the point phil's making is that this game sucks Kappa 

[15:25] <brokenpotatol23> give the devs some time to fix it 

[15:25] <sprank_n> for a game to be functional Fil has to win Kappa 

[15:25] <novaenforcer> The game is an Alpha on PC and they ported it to Xbox lol 

[15:25] <jony2jackl> Pants have been changed folks GET HYPED 

[15:25] <encelor> he missed ammo 

[15:25] <encelor> LUL 

[15:25] <wooter420> nothing LUL

[15:25] <lancesjohnson> why play this game if its so bad? 

[15:25] <wilus84> @NovaEnforcer it's not alpha on pc the games launched december 20th 
[15:25] <super_skyhawk_x_> At Phil, Sounds like an excuse to me. Kappa 

[15:25] <sethl89> normally its fine but the actuation point for razer green switches are even lower than cherry 
MX switches so i accidentally type random letters lol 
[15:25] <wilus84> launches* 

[15:25] <wooter420> nothing cept that ump and 90 rounds 
[15:25] <dweezlr> FBtouchdown 

[15:25] <lastkryptonian94> cheer 10 That's what I meant by coming at this with the wrong mindset. PUBG isn't a 
competitive shooter, it's a battle royale survival game. It's not CoD. 

[15:25] <loyaltytv> ump and mad rounds in that shed 
[15:25] <synced420> open your eyes 5Y‘€ 

[15:25] <bethelewd> jim join me on ps4 come to the dark side

[15:26] <drilbit777> That and he plays on lowest settings 

[15:26] <novaenforcer> @wilus84 okay the optimization is pretty flawed for it to be a launched game, so bad 
that you can call it an alpha lol 

[15:26] <brokenpotatol23> dank side phil is a better name 

[15:26] <sethl89> i want to upgrade to either razer orange siwtches or cherry mx brown switches 
[15:26] <elzorrobot> how many deaths so far?

[15:27] <dweezlr> How many by the plague? 

[15:27] <sethl89> i just like razer because of the cool lighting effects, like right now on my keybaord i have a 

Christmas tree and its snowing down the keys 

[15:27] <encelor> 0 

[15:27] <encelor> he died of players 

[15:27] <gokai_blue> Yeah, I get around 144fps on a 1060 at 1440p. The Xbox One X still has a weak CPU, 
though, and this game is really CPU based. 

[15:27] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[15:27] <wilus84> @NovaEnforcer well nova call the devs and tell them that cause it's launching dec 20th

[16:24] <jmon_1985> No 

[16:24] <shroomtastic> it does work, it shows you were the bullet will hit 
[16:24] <yaboybob> no fpp on console? 

[16:24] <darthradovanviking> Changing perspective wouldn’t normally change the angle of the gun., what 
bullshit is that? 

[16:24] <dweezlr> you're getting punk’d! 

[16:24] <hobbsl017> u got killed from behind

[16:24] <dukaduka> FBpenalty illegal block on the wall, 10 yard penalty, still 1st down 
[16:24] <jmon_1985> Wtf is he taking about 

[16:24] <sethl89> cheerlO in third person, there was a red dot on the wall that shows where your shots would 
land

[16:24] <sportingcpl7> lol u where just shooting the wall if u where in 1st u would of seen u n wall lol 
[16:24] <beatlesl2335> maybe he didnt kill you 

[16:24] <the_bitty> did you not see the red dot on the wall that shows you where you where aiming? 

[16:24] <novaenforcer> Logically you sin down sights when trying to aim through a break in a wall lol 
[16:24] <erisior> I'm excited to watch sniping on Xbox. 

[16:24] <tupakaveli> 3rd person = hip fire 

[16:24] <playcooll8> get a good scope and AR and use aim down for FPS for shooting 

[16:24] <solidussnakex> 30 frames piece of garbage 

[16:24] <vendatus> BabyRage 

[16:24] <dweezlr> so true @marshmelons 

[16:24] <hobbsl017> he got clipped from behind 

[16:24] <the_bitty> you where shooting the wall 

[16:24] <rur0h> yeah its happend to me before. 

[16:24] <ecclesiastes_iii> this game just got released and needs time to get patches 
[16:24] <erisior> Nope, still would have hit the wall. 

[16:24] <zybatzuu> Died from behind yeah 

[16:25] <meshugamaven> Whata€™s it like to play in slow mo on console? 

[16:25] <brokenpotatol23> maybe someone else killed you 
[16:25] <scruffshark> It’s called aiming down sights. 

[16:25] <rur0h> you hold the gun higher in first person as if you are scoping in. 

[16:25] <brokenpotatol23> not him 

[16:25] <markymark52> cheer25 I have to admit that was horse shit Phil. 

[16:25] <ihav4gotn> FPS DansGame 
[16:25] <coralguy> that map lol 

[16:25] <shroomtastic> aim down sight doesn’t change angle of shot compared to hip fire? 

[16:25] <polystralianeasypino> reminds me of tribes 2 

[16:25] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Behind you. You were kill from behind. Not the front. Behind. Like, behind 
your back. 



[16:25] <sethl89> rip my cheer 
[16:25] <sethl89> k 

[16:25] <spongebelt_> Invisible walls lol 

[16:25] <erisior> The shots were from behind him. Not the wall guy lmfao 

[16:25] <forgedfantom> There was a red zone marker on the wall that shows that your gun barrel was 
obstructed... 

[16:25] <butter_my_bread> yea dsp just fired from the hip which hurts ur perspective Vs ADS'ing 

[16:25] <ozza360> of course you would still aim different., because you would have seen you were aiming at the 

wall and then changed your aim. 

[16:25] <kumachan> Silky smooth 8 fps 
[16:25] <theravenger01> lol rip indeed 
[16:25] <elzorrobot> rinse and repeat 

[16:25] <plagueweilder97> @DarksydePhil why play games that sucks? 

[16:25] <darthradovanviking> I am thinking the other player clipped the gun trhrough the wlal or something 
[16:25] <sportingcpl7> lol u would of hit wall wit that ass aiming u where doing 

[16:25] <flexmastodon> hint: aiming down the sights tends to improve accuracy, so you can avoid hitting the 
wall 

[16:25] <theravenger01> wasn't having it 

[16:25] <zybatzuu> Guys please don't make purchasing decisions based off this clueless gameplay 
[16:25] <dudderasl3> They should have first person only mode 

[16:25] <asloppybr> it clearly shows the red circle that indicates you werent able to hit him, before you even fired 

[16:25] <zybatzuu> Game is alright 

[16:25] <lesterwastaken> rnmin that smooth framerate 

[16:25] <novaenforcer> @darthradovanviking aiming down sights and then therea€™s hip firing.what shit 

you on lol 

[16:25] <vendatus> then stop playing LUL 

[16:25] <talanock> just becuase the cursor is over the guy doesn't mean you’ll hit the target. 

[16:25] <scruffshark> shooting from the hip is different from aiming your sights down from a fps view. 

[16:25] <theravenger01> 2 FPS PogChamp PogChamp 

[16:25] <brokenpotatol23> someone else killed you from behind i think @DarksydePhil 

[16:25] <butter_my_bread> dsp and Viking should get a room rooKiss rooLewd 

[16:25] <meshugamaven> Xbox doesna€™t have fps only mode? 

[16:25] <novaenforcer> What shit* 

[16:25] <lokizarro> When you ADS you place your eyes DIRECTLY down the sight so of course it's different.

[16:36] <rurOh> game is popular from PC play not xbox which has only been out for a couple days. 

[16:36] <firedrake82> year 1 of destiny was great, destiny 2 is garbage cause theres nothing to do in it

[16:37] <dragoon_ryy> better fps and building in fortnite 

[16:37] <octoa> I dunno man. I'm having an ok time with Destiny 2 

[16:37] <strugglesome> they are pretty useful if you are far from the circle 

[16:37] <thatanonyraccoon> I Hate Everything had a gr8 video about why Destiny 2 is bad 

[16:37] <i_came_here_to_something> @Sethl89 There's nothing graphically demanding about the game so the 

console ver running bad on X is down to the devs not caring to optimize. Maybe it's a heavy CPU-based game 

tho, X still has shitty Jaguar cores like Pro and the other systems 

[16:37] <spongebelt_> Fortnite is more polished 

[16:37] <pixlblitz> building in fortnite

[16:38] <meshugamaven> The game will be better, hopefully with the 1.0 update coming soon...we shall see 
[16:38] <convertedclone> tho* 

[16:38] <octoa> the only issues I'm having with Destiny 2 are how Bungo just seems fucking incompetent in 
terms of PR and basic game decisions 

[16:38] <sethl89> @I_Came_Here_To_Something that's the point, its a cpu hog, not gpu. thqat's why on the X it 
runs just as bad, the consoles have gharbage cpus 
[16:38] <theravenger01> @Octoa I agree 

[16:38] <octoa> like, right now, the prestige raid is no more difficult 

[16:38] <tupakaveli> @DarksydePhil If you wanna learn ALL of the controls, just hold the start button for 2 
second. Givin' you a heads up. 

[16:39] <theravenger01> yeah 

[16:39] <encelor> fulltime pubG streamer 

[16:39] <zybatzuu> Trust me watching half way competent players changes the feel of this game completely 
[16:39] <dylannw> This formula was kinda done years ago in The Last of Us Multiplayer in 2013, theres a mode 
in TLOU where is basically BR 

[16:39] <octoa> because people bitched and moaned after the DLC released and they couldn’t play it 
[16:39] <teargasl01> who in here plays warframe, i havent played since that priest frame made its entrence 
[16:39] <meshugamaven> @sethl89 ita€™s also just terribly optimized 
[16:39] <sethl89> yeah, that too 

[16:39] <octoa> so instead of growing a fucking spine, Bungie just reduced to level cap 
[16:39] <zybatzuu> There's a reason it has sold 20 million copies in only like half a year 



[16:39] <asloppybr> bruh how muck 9mm you need 
[16:39] <dweezlr> crossbow. 

[16:39] <convertedclone> what is it 

[16:39] <octoa> without fixing the level caps for regular raid 

[16:39] <theravenger01> @Octoa wow lol 

[16:39] <lord_edmund_blackadder> It looks like it's a crossbow 

[16:39] <i_came_here_to_something> @Sethl89 Yeah, I was wondering as such. Lots of A.I-based stuff to 
account for, A.I and logic don’t give a fuck about GPU power, only CPU. 

[16:39] <socks68> no 

[16:39] <sethl89> thats just why its so bad on console, its horribly unoptomised and a cpu hog hosting 100 
people 

[16:39] <oooooar> phil im sorry but ur the worst person ive ever seen play this game 
[16:39] <dragoon_ryy> go for headshots 

[16:39] <rur0h> the gas tank takes alot of room in your backpack by the way. You waste alto of space picking it 
up. 

[16:39] <strugglesome> its the best PogChamp 

[16:39] <meshugamaven> You dona€™t want that 

[16:39] <lesterwastaken> crossbows are not good 

[16:39] <retrocerverus> shouldn’t make a sound 

[16:39] <theravenger01> that's shitty 

[16:39] <dragoon_ryy> it 1 shots everything in the head 

[16:39] <kumachan> Nope. No good. Especially with a controller. 

[16:40] <eliteshadowninja> def not good 
[16:40] <meshugamaven> Ita€™s rare but will get you killed 
[16:40] <lesterwastaken> they are slow and take forever to load 
[16:40] <thatanonyraccoon> why would a crossbow be good? 

[16:40] <lancesjohnson> lol @strugglesome 
[16:40] <thatanonyraccoon> there's guns 

[16:40] <octoa> meaning there's no fucking point to doing Prestige because people are fucking retarded 

[16:40] <sethl89> @DarksydePhil it can 1-shot people without top gear 

[16:40] <retrocerverus> its a silent killer 

[16:40] <convertedclone> crossbow or shotgun? BrokeBack 

[16:40] <ltpenguin22> your loot game is on point 

[16:40] <eliteshadowninja> LUL

[16:40] <octoa> otherwise, I'm having an ok time 
[16:40] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Crossbow is pretty OP 
[16:40] <lancesjohnson> hininm...crossbow vs gun 
[16:40] <meshugamaven> No one picks it up 
[16:40] <strugglesome> cuz its the best PogChamp 

[16:40] <radicalenzyme> If you can aim its good but its useless with a controller 
[16:40] <theravenger01> @Octoa gotcha' 

[16:40] <lumbo95> you want to put that bullet loop on your shutgun 

[16:40] <rur0h> its good early game weapon when you are rushed to pick something up thats all. 

[16:40] <pawiq> It can be good on console when someone stay still for long time
