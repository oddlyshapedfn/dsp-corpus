[04:31] <gamemaster2003isdead> cheer30 

[04:57] <kusomoto> damn 

[05:47] <gamemaster2003isdead> cheer25 

[06:47] <gamemaster2003isdead> cheerlO 

[07:18] <gamemaster2003isdead> cheerlO 

[07:39] <goldencolts> cheer30 

[07:52] <goldencolts> cheerl5 

[09:33] <goldencolts> cheer20 

[09:33] <thenewfaceofcreation> stop it 

[09:33] <thenewfaceofcreation> why you doing this :p 

[09:33] <thenewfaceofcreation> answer me 

[09:34] <goldencolts> we must show cheer 

[09:34] <thenewfaceofcreation> cheer for what 

[09:35] <thenewfaceofcreation> do it when he is on 

[09:35] kthenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[09:35] <thenewfaceofcreation> @GoldenColts are you drunk Kappa 

[09:36] <goldencolts> no its not even noon O_o 

[09:37] <thenewfaceofcreation> yup 

[09:37] <thenewfaceofcreation> you are drunk 

[09:37] kthenewfaceofcreation> Kappa 

[09:37] <goldencolts> dspFacepalm 

[09:37] <thenewfaceofcreation> "not even noon" 

[09:37] <thenewfaceofcreation> ? 

[09:38] <goldencolts> i do normally sip some beers through the evening 
but not during the day 

[09:38] <goldencolts> just short cans of pabst lol 

[09:39] <thenewfaceofcreation> then why you do cheers before stream? 
[09:39] <thenewfaceofcreation> just asking 

[09:40] <goldencolts> i keep the page open in the window and open the ads 
for bits in the background as i do other stuff on my computer 
[09:41] <goldencolts> twitch's ads program dont really make sense so 
sometimes it wont give you any, sometimes it will give more after a small 
cheer, and sometimes it will let you watch a bunch of ads at once and get 
like 200+ bits 

[09:41] kthenewfaceofcreation> huh

[11:18] <darksydephil> wassap 
[11:18] <jackwhite202> loved it 

[11:19] <jackwhite202> best spiderman movie to date IMO 
[11:19] <bethemadeagle> hey phil 

[11:20] <bethemadeagle> pider man homecoming is a good movie 
[11:20] <bethemadeagle> me like 

[11:20] <majinboo3> LOL i watched last nights need for speed videos 
[11:20] <jackwhite202> me too 

[11:20] <majinboo3> And what a blatant cheater 

[11:20] <darksydephil> hmm some good news today for sure on all fronts! 
[11:21] <jackwhite202> the movie just perfectly captured who spiderman 
[11:21] <bethemadeagle> HOORAY 
[11:21] <jackwhite202> is 

[11:21] <jackwhite202> Phil have you senn SM homecoming? 

[11:21] <majinboo3> we reached the patreon goal? 

[11:21] <bethemadeagle> yes of course we reached the goal 
[11:21] <bethemadeagle> then we have the new goal 

[11:22] <jackwhite202> now that ive watched homecoming i have seen all 17 
movies in the MCU 

[11:23] <bethemadeagle> i havent seen dr strange :D 
[11:23] <bethemadeagle> not yet 

[11:23] <darksydephil> dr strange was weird but good 

[11:23] <darksydephil> pretty funny 

[11:23] <bethemadeagle> or thor ragnorok 

[11:23] <jackwhite202> its great 

[11:23] <jackwhite202> benedict was great 

[11:23] <jackwhite202> ragnarok was awesome 

[11:23] <jackwhite202> that thor vs hulk rematch 

[11:23] <bethemadeagle> thor and hulk always be fighting though 

[11:24] <jackwhite202> they are like those two kids in high school who 

like beating each other up 

[11:24] <jackwhite202> also ragnaroks ending 
[11:24] <jackwhite202> completely shocked me 

[11:25] <bethemadeagle> thor is the only one who can take a punch from 
hulk and survive, apart from iron man in his hulkbuster suit 
[11:25] <jackwhite202> thanos can take a punch from hulk as well 
[11:25] <bethemadeagle> meh thanos isnt human 
[11:26] <bethemadeagle> neither is thor but still 
[11:26] <jackwhite202> thor isnt either 

[11:26] <jackwhite202> Phil which is your favorite MCU movie? 

[11:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> no one is here i see 
[11:26] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[11:26] <jackwhite202> mine is the Winter Soldier 

[11:26] <bethemadeagle> nope no one at all 

[11:26] <bethemadeagle> i liked guardians of the galaxy 1 

[11:26] <bethemadeagle> 2 was just as good 

[11:27] <jackwhite202> ehh 

[11:27] <jackwhite202> 2 was good 

[11:27] <jackwhite202> but nowhere near as good as the first one 
[11:27] <bethemadeagle> i loved baby groot 
[11:27] <jackwhite202> I am Groot 
[11:27] <jackwhite202> :P 



[11:27] <bethemadeagle> i like the credit scene when groot is a teen :D 
[11:28] <jackwhite202> i liked the credits scene with stan lee 
[11:28] <bethemadeagle> oh yeah ahha 

[11:28] <jackwhite202> Winter Soldier is still the best MCU movie IMO 
[11:29] <bethemadeagle> winter soldier is pretty good though 
[11:29] <jackwhite202> Infinity War hype 
[11:30] <bethemadeagle> yes infinity war hype 
[11:31] <bethemadeagle> the we get BLACK PANTHER HYPE 

[11:31] <jackwhite202> wonder if black panther will tie in with Infinity 
War 

[11:31] <jackwhite202> or if it will be just a standalone movie 
[11:31] <bethemadeagle> he was in the trailer so of course he is in it 
[11:31] <jackwhite202> i mean the movie 

[11:32] <jackwhite202> also we still dont know where the last Infinity 
Stone is 

[11:33] <bethemadeagle> black panther movie will be after infinity war so 
the post credits will prob lead into that 

[11:33] <bethemadeagle> unless black panther comes before 
[11:33] <bethemadeagle> i dont know 

[11:33] <jackwhite202> some people speculate the last stone is in wakanda 
[11:34] <darksydephil> it is 

[11:34] <zetseun> DOOOOOOOOD the game spawned a car in front of me again 
[11:34] <darksydephil> why else would they even be involved 
[11:34] <zetseun> AGEEEEED 
[11:34] <infamousecondson> Is this HZD? 

[11:34] <xmonsoonmoon> elaHi 

[11:34] <jackwhite202> but why would the Soul Stone be in Wakanda? 

[11:35] <glitch_crazed> WHO LET THE SOULS OUT? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> because they didn't create anywhere else for it to 
be in the MCU 

[11:35] <ass_blastor> coz that's where the strongest metal on earth comes 
from 

[11:35] <jackwhite202> i guess youre right 

[11:35] <jackwhite202> maybe thats how vibranium was created 
[11:35] <jackwhite202> with the soul stone 
[11:35] <jackwhite202> or idk 
[11:35] <vendatus> dspPepe 

[11:36] <majinboo3> phil whats your thoughts on the die so far?

Marathon.

[11:37] <vendatus> dspPepe 

[11:37] <glitch_crazed> Sdarksydephil what do you think of Bates Motel so

[11:40] <vendatus> bethe Dr.Strange has the time stone LUL 
[11:40] <bethemadeagle> ven pfft he took it to nepal 

[11:40] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle would the space stone be destroyed 
if loki would have left in on Asgard? 

[11:40] <glitch_crazed> Wasn't the soul stone the tesseract? Or is that 
the space stone? 

[11:40] <ass_blastor> What the fuck... the live pet is starting over at 
level 1. 

[11:40] <bethemadeagle> jack no why would it 
[11:41] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle idk 

[11:41] <bethemadeagle> it would prob just float in space lol 
[11:41] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle ironic 

[11:41] <vendatus> no he placed it in the New York Sanctum's hidden room 
LUL 

[11:41] <jackwhite202> in a nutshell 

[11:41] <bethemadeagle> oh sure ven course he did 

[11:42] <bethemadeagle> trying to troll me cause i havent seen dr strange 
yet 

[11:42] <darksydephil> the live pet crashed? lol

[11:42] <darksydephil> ill have to tell them that 
[11:42] <vendatus> rewatch the movie LUL 
[11:42] <goldencolts> it lost all its progress 
[11:42] <atlastelamon9> Hi Phil 

[11:42] <bethemadeagle> i havent watched it once ven :D 
[11:42] <sethl89> how you doin today phil? @DarksydePhil 
[11:42] <goldencolts> it was level 37 or 38 by the end of yesterday and 
looked like BabyRage the pet

[11:43] <bethemadeagle> i want to watch it 
[11:43] <bethemadeagle> same as thor 

[11:43] <glitch_crazed> I still have yet to see Ragnarok 

[11:43] <glitch_crazed> Just finally managed to watch Incredible Hulk 

last night. 

[11:44] <glitch_crazed> It was alright, still think Mark Ruffalo is best 
though being as how he was the first Hulk I saw. 

[11:44] <jackwhite202> there was a theory that the Soul Stone was in 
Heimdall's posession 

[11:44] <jackwhite202> hence the orange eyes 

[11:44] <somethingyer2> it sucks there'll never be another co op with 
John 

[11:44] <aproxymate> can the streamer reset the pet? 

[11:44] <glitch_crazed> But Edward Norton has done a good job too 
[11:44] <vendatus> Well if you watched the IW trailer you spoiled 
Ragnarok for yourself imo 
[11:44] <eckuk2> no xenoblade 2? 

[11:45] <glitch_crazed> Ovendatus I kinda was already spoiled by posts on 
fb so it's not really a big deal 

[11:45] <bethemadeagle> ven i saw what happens in thor and dr strange but 
i still wanna see em though 
[11:45] <aproxymate> [schedule

[11:46] <glitch_crazed> Heimdall 

[11:46] <jackwhite202> so the soul stone is in something that starts with

[11:47] <thenewfaceofcreation> i heard that phil would do MGS 
[11:47] <thenewfaceofcreation> is that true 
[11:47] <vendatus> mebbe it's in Heimdalls sword 

[11:47] <alex_dragonul> Yes the redemption runs returned , after that we 
need the worst games return and maybe more retro replays ? , a DS 2 , pop 
2008 etc would be sweet 
[11:47] <glitch_crazed> Maybe 

[11:47] <goldencolts> look at the prestream slides @TheNewFaceofCreation 
[11:48] <goldencolts> lol 

[11:48] <jackwhite202> well there are 2 possibly places where the soul 
stone would be 

[11:48] kthenewfaceofcreation> i wasnt watching 

[11:48] kthenewfaceofcreation> now i do 

[11:48] <jackwhite202> 1. Heimdall 2. Wakanda

[11:49] <astrojetboy> cheerlO Just out of interest, will you consider 

adding Fortnite to Salty Saturdays for extra PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt. 

[11:49] <vendatus> If I say why it might be the sword it's a spoiler 

dspPepe 

[11:49] <jackwhite202> or maybe thanos already has the stone 
[11:49] kthenewfaceofcreation> how will the redemption run will work

[11:50] <glitch_crazed> So no Christmas tree lighting this year? 

[11:50] <bethemadeagle> i am telling you right now thanos will get all 6 
stones and then some bullshit will happen to stop him like in every movie 
ever where the good guys win 

[11:50] <glitch_crazed> Being as how you've said before she prefers her 
life private. 

[11:50] <mattty3888> someone prob jelly about ladyfruend 
[11:50] <goldencolts> :o 

[11:50] <thenewfaceofcreation> we were joking lo 
[11:50] <thenewfaceofcreation> lol 

[11:50] <kushiyakitori> ??? who said that? i didn't see that 
[11:50] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle probably 



[11:50] <vendatus> Well in the trailer where Thanos exists the portal 

that's Xandar so he gets that first LUL 

[11:50] <briankrebs> gatoThonking

[11:51] <thenewfaceofcreation> it was a joke lol 
[11:51] <aproxymate> why do you get riled up so easily? 

[11:51] <infinite_sphere> FailFish 

[11:51] <jackwhite202> @Vendatus because im pretty sure thanos wound let 
the planet live if he went there 

[11:52] <bethemadeagle> thanos dont give a fuck he will destroy the 
universe if he gets the stones or not 

[11:52] <vendatus> well he probably sent his Dark Order there first while 
he deals with Loki 

[11:52] <thenewfaceofcreation> you do phil 

[11:52] <bammbino> @DarksydePhil odd question., is it profitable for you 
to stream AWFULLY designed games like NFS payback vs a good game like 
HZD? 

[11:52] <korewasugoi> issa joke 
[11:53] <prettyrikii> say lady friend?? 

[11:53] <glitch_crazed> Is jussa joke 
[11:53] <thenewfaceofcreation> whatever 

[11:53] <bethemadeagle> loki will probably die because tom hiddlestone 
isnt going to be in any more movies with chris hemsworth 
[11:53] <alukartl77> lol

[11:53] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle well loki did fail thanos 
[11:53] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle so thanos is probably going to kill 
him 

[11:53] <bethemadeagle> exactly 

[11:54] <vendatus> Well remember Thanos was gonna destroy Xandar for 
Ronan 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> loki will probably die then we have vision dying 

cause he has a freakin stone in his head 

[11:54] * thenewfaceofcreation shout hi to bethes ear 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> ahhhhhhh 

[11:54] <insomniakgaming> Did you hit that nov goal? Sorry if you said or 
been asked this, I just got in here. 

[11:54] <korewasugoi> *like every NFS before payback* 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> stop shouting in me ear delta 

[11:54] <jackwhite202> would thanos use the stone to destroy xandar or by 
himself? 

[11:54] <bethemadeagle> hello man 



[11:54] <glitch_crazed> @insomniakgaming he has not discussed that yet 
[11:54] <thenewfaceofcreation> HI 
[11:54] <thenewfaceofcreation> :p 

[11:55] <bethemadeagle> jack he could do it without the stone lol 
[11:55] <sethl89> if you're the new face of creation, what happened to 
the old one? 

[11:55] kthenewfaceofcreation> what inspired you to replay MGS 
@DarksydePhil 

[11:55] <jackwhite202> @BetheMadEagle i see 

[11:55] <glitch_crazed> What happened to salty Sundays? Lol 
[11:55] <vendatus> Jack we'd never know since Ronan betrayed him LUL 
[11:56] <ornightz> cheerlO Have you ever had Mac & Beef a combination of 
Macroni and ground beef LUL 
[11:56] <astrojetboy> More COD 

[11:56] <alex_dragonul> There better be Kojima jokes or else i won't

[11:56] <tigerflamessssss> PowerUpL YouDontSay UWot PowerUpR 

[11:56] kthenewfaceofcreation> @DarksydePhil will you say to people not 

to help you unless its needed ? 

[11:56] <sethl89> is that a bootleg hamburger helper LUL ? @Ornightz 
[11:56] <bethemadeagle> thanos will prob go to the nova corp and the 
collector first before going to earth because why else would the 
guardians come 

[11:56] kthenewfaceofcreation> @alex_dragonul im worried that people 
would help phil like with DS 

[11:56] <ass_blastor> SOrnightz Have you have fried onions with mac and 
cheese?

just getting super-frustrated while playing it

[12:31] <astrojetboy> Tell John Rambo or Howard to sue him :D :D :D :D 
[12:31] <uhluhtc_lives> Sue him, you can get all your court fees back. It 
would be cheaper than just paying the fuckup

taxes before he can even consider it

[13:38] <always_reeemember> *LOL 

[13:38] <orionrogue> how's he doing? had to step away for a bit 
[13:39] <skormhammer_mills> Stakethewine no 
[13:39] <vendatus> Jimbob what % it at? LUL 

[13:39] ktheycallmejimbob> so far so good only 1 death so far 

[13:39] <darkone667> play game in easiest possible mode, surprised when 

takes damage 

[13:39] <takethewine> ok fair enough 

[13:39] <bethemadeagle> jim phil will DIE to the t rex im calling it now 
[13:39] <divanerasmus> hello @DarksydePhil hello Severyone 
[13:40] <theycallmejimbob> it has mixed overall reviews on steam Vendatus 
but free is free :D 
[13:40] <vendatus> LUL 

[13:40] <mrkarlsync> How long is the base game and expansion? roughly. 
[13:40] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello DivanErasmus 

[13:40] <theycallmejimbob> BetheMadEagle he's gonna one shot it calling 
it now 

[13:40] <sardarkh> Just tripcaster one shot the T-rex 

[13:40] <orionrogue> doesn't ThunderJaw sound like a James Bond female 
villain or evil henchwoman? 

[13:41] <sardarkh> Not at all. Too harsh 
[13:41] <mrkarlsync> hahaha 

[13:41] <vendatus> ThunderLips from Rocky LUL 

[13:41] <ghettocinderellas> The Bureau is so meh. It's not terrible, but 
there's little motivation to keep playing it. 

[13:41] <bethemadeagle> jim you better not be lying to me or i should 
make it 5 deaths instead 

[13:41] <ghettocinderellas> The game is so mindless. 

[13:41] <darkone667> come on man fight the thing 



[13:41] <mrkarlsync> I would assume at this level in the game you should 
be able to manhandle these sort of mobs. 

[13:41] <darkone667> its the least boring part of this playthrough 
[13:42] <sardarkh> Far less boring than Andromeda anyways 
[13:42] <papalouthefirst> waddup daddyphil 

[13:42] <darkone667> andromeda was so boring i slept through it 
[13:42] <djrunol> oh yeah, i forgot that you have a mount in this game, 
phil never uses it 

[13:43] <vendatus> Andromeda is better than this fight me dspPepe 
[13:43] <mrkarlsync> Any news on DSP coming back to SF5 with Season 3? 
[13:43] <theycallmejimbob> Andromeda deluxe edition got added to Origin 
Access dspHmm 

[13:43] <pray4rock> yeah, but then people complain that games are too 
linear 

[13:43] <ghettocinderellas> We need good side questing to return. Not 
open world tedium. 

[13:43] * bethemadeagle fights vendatus 

[13:43] <theycallmejimbob> no chance of that happening MrKarlSync :D 
[13:43] <datoneguyweallknow> why not? 

[13:43] <dukaduka> but how do you balance two contradictory things 
NotLikeThis how do you find the right amount of salt and pepper 
[13:43] <vendatus> dspShock 

[13:43] <darkone667> got hopes for death stranding 

[13:44] ktheycallmejimbob> Yogscast has a humble bundle now a new game 
everyday though the first couple of games have been bundled a ton already 
[13:44] <ghettocinderellas> We don't need the same side "content" 
scattered across the map a dozen times just to call it "open world". 
[13:44] <bethemadeagle> andromeda game of the year fight me 
[13:44] <mrkarlsync> Sdukaduka Because button commands are recorded in 
replays so he cant say he was blocking when he was down back like 
punch/kicking on wake up. 

[13:44] <d2tz> is phil playing on a base ps4? 

[13:44] <vendatus> yup 

[13:44] ktheycallmejimbob> yup d2tz 

[13:44] <d2tz> ok 

[13:44] <d2tz> windmills ....lol 

[13:45] <ghettocinderellas> Stheycallmejimbob I almost died laughing when 
I saw that. Poor little andromeda. You didn't deserve that fate. 

[13:45] <darkone667> game so easy npc's fight the enemies for you 
[13:45] <papalouthefirst> @DarksydePhil congratz on finding true love 
again daddyphil <3 

[13:45] <ghettocinderellas> This dude. 

[13:45] <theycallmejimbob> wonder how long till they add NFS and SWB2 to 
it GhettoCinderellas I know people hate EA but origin access is pretty 
good value 

[13:45] <marshmelons> lmao all those missed shots 
[13:46] <ghettocinderellas> It really is tbh Jimbob. 

[13:46] <bethemadeagle> kill phil rexy 

[13:46] <kushiyakitori> i guess he forgot about heavy weapons 
[13:46] <popsicolo> Her name is Mei-loy now. OpieOP 

[13:46] <darkone667> rex has 0 chance against no dodge needed armour

[13:47] <orionrogue> big damage! big prizes!! 

[13:47] <mrkarlsync> i havnt played this game but since he just strippped 
the armor off im guessing then he needs to use other weapons to finish it 
off? 

[13:47] <bethemadeagle> this isnt fail 

[13:47] <ghettocinderellas> @theycallmejimbob Did they put micro¬ 
transactions back into battlefront 2? I'm guessing like two months after 
that, so it can kind of be "free to play". Kappa 
[13:47] <bethemadeagle> fair 

[13:47] <mrkarlsync> instead of just hosing it down with this ice staff. 

[13:47] <popsicolo> A crevaaaasse 

[13:47] <vendatus> pops not thicc enough TriHard 

[13:47] <kushiyakitori> @MrKarlSync that would be a smarter way to do it, 
yes 

[13:47] <industrialspaceman> glitch 

[13:47] <kushiyakitori> @MrKarlSync this enemy also has strong weapons 
you can use against it when you strip them off 

[13:48] <ghettocinderellas> This is the fight everyone was hyped for? 

[13:48] <bethemadeagle> pops is T H I C C :0 

[13:48] <popsicolo> I wish I was thicc

[13:48] <bethemadeagle> jim was right 

[13:48] <vendatus> bethe he one shot it LUL 

[13:49] <mrkarlsync> a shame really, seems like it could of been a more 
interesting fight if different assortment of weaponary was used. 

[13:49] <bethemadeagle> even broken clocks are right twice a day jim 
[13:49] <aragorio> Why is the chat so dead?

[13:49] <always_reeemember> they were hard because you didnt have crutch 
armor? 

[13:49] <kushiyakitori> because people aren't interested in watching is 
@aragorio 

[13:50] <dukaduka> die makes the game easier so it can introduce harder 
enemies OpieOP that's the power of the game development cycle 
[13:50] <theycallmejimbob> How long was Mass Effect out till they added 
it to Access 7 months I reckon Battlefront will beat it GhettoCinderellas

[13:51] <kushiyakitori> its with bandits 

[13:51] <bethemadeagle> i was right in the redemption run 

[13:51] <sardarkh> Introduce harder enemies, force to buy lootboxes.

[14:06] <ghettocinderellas> @KushiYakitori @DarksydePhil Might I 
recommend a 40 oz of the finest Colt 45? 

[14:06] <kushiyakitori> @Pinkdam yeah, they are supposed to be 
"redemption runs"

[14:06] <me_god> "My runs through MGS2/3 were sloppy, awful, and during

around, I will commit to attempting to learn the controls, gameplay

rather than just flubbing my way through!"

believe it

[14:07] <ghettocinderellas> Should have made cooking with the king the 
goal. 

[14:07] <leonaras> Sdarksydephil is this game worth buying? 

[14:07] <kushiyakitori> @Pinkdam i think he did actually, and redeemed as 
in playing them better than the first time cause he did them awfully 
before

lol 

[14:23] <pinkdam> well it's possible the bandits only recruit from 
villages and don't have any womenfolk of their own, but that would make 
these longterm looking camps unlikely if they were that kind of bandit 
[14:23] <zaxbys_sauce> someone ban the troll they've been here long 
enough

America 

[15:28] <goldencolts> i dont think people like watching HZD too much 
[15:28] <always_reeemember> SGoldenColts if he took off the op armor it 
might get more interesting 

[15:28] <hindae> My only complaint about HZD is the disappearing spear 
when she stows it. Like, what, does she shove it up her ass or something?

[16:06] <bammbino> this armor alone saved phil 2-3 hours of gameplay time 
due to it being so op 

[16:06] <musclesforbonesk how many batteries does that hacker wand take? 
[16:06] <vendatusk Jimbob I'm guessing LUL 

[16:06] <bammbinok @KushiYakitori its normal + an OP armor 
[16:07] <caliggyjackk ok maybe Shadowfall pissed in the gameplay 
department, but I still prefer that story over this.

RPGs

time 

[16:10] <marshmelons> pre patch this boss was way harder 
[16:11] <theycallmejimbob> not yet Snake it's not over yet 
[16:11] <bammbino> SCaliggyJack i loved FF15 despite its flaws, if a game 
deserves hate, its FF15 and not this game 
[16:11] <pinkdam> this is the only 2017 I remember 
[16:11] <fartinginmysleep> @DarksydePhil Phil would you consider 
marathoning all of the call of duty titles before the new release

[16:19] <dukaduka> @DivanErasmus it's a beautiful game with fun open 
world gameplay. If you can afford it, buy it. If you're critical, the 
story is poorly told, the exploration can feel repetitive and wonky at 
times. Whatcha gonna do?

[16:28] <fartinginmysleep> @Bammbino I dont like the term SJW, but whats 
wrong with fighting for social justice? I no its meant to be derogatory 
buts its not. Their are annoying ppl who are in it to make an overbearing 
brand for themselves, but most of us just care about stuff like universal 
healthcare, free public college, my neighbors not fearing or resenting me 
because of creed, etc 

[16:28] <fartinginmysleep> and we love to sniff our own ASSES too lol! 
[16:28] <caliggyjack> Sthatanonybear I voted for Gary "Where's Aleppo"
