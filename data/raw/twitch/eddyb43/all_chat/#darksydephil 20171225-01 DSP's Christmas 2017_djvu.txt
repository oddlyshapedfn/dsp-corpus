[09:56] <critical_for_d4ys> someone said to me why cheer to phil 

[09:57] <critical_for_d4ys> do they say the same thing to you 

[09:57] <critical_for_d4ys> cuz im tired of it:( 

[09:57] <thatanonyraccoon> they did at first, then I told them to fuck off 
[09:57] <critical_for_d4ys> are they banned 

[09:57] <thatanonyraccoon> the irony is that the people who usually get mad at us for cheering DSP are NEETS 

who don’t watch other Twitch streamerrs 

[09:57] <thatanonyraccoon> @Critical_For_D4ys usually, yeah 

[09:59] <critical_for_d4ys> ok :)

[10:08] <yuichimccry> ok thanks, for some reason he has me blocked on twitter 
[10:08] <thatanonyraccoon> might be a misclick 



[10:09] <thatanonyraccoon> he was trying to hit the "i love this tweet" button, accidentally blocks you 
[10:09] <yuichimccry> not sure, I know he has said he never unblocks people so not a big deal 
[10:09] <thatanonyraccoon> tbf the process for unblocking people is convoluted and arduous

[12:03] <thatanonyraccoon> @Skooma_Dealer probably for food 
[12:03] <thatanonyraccoon> just a wild guess 

[12:04] <skooma_dealer> @ThatAnonyRaccoon usually but its like the thought leaves me 
[12:04] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> drinking out of Santa's Butt will give your brain a workout 
[12:04] <musclesforbones> I saw santas bare ass last night, he was farting in my face. 

[12:04] <mk4eva> and the worst part me driving in that fucking snow blizzard storm 
[12:04] <darksydephil> for a knife to fend off an intruder? 

[12:04] <thatanonyraccoon> @Derichloveslemur coming to streams? yes. started watching DSP content? no

[12:06] <skooma_dealer> what about vid.me?

watch on twitch 

[12:06] <sneaky_vape> hope everyone is having a great Christmas, my dog died from food poisoning overnight. 

its been really rough day so thanks for streaming phil 

[12:06] <thatanonyraccoon> iirc he has all the archives, or most of them

internet

[12:07] <skooma_dealer> google vs amazon 

[12:07] <darksydephil> Amazon just trademarked and patented stuff for their own VOD website 

[12:07] <skooma_dealer> titan fight 

[12:07] <darksydephil> so....possibly GGPO youtube soon 

[12:07] <convertedclone> well if they kill off youtube there goes phil’s business :\ 

[12:07] <skooma_dealer> interesting 

[12:07] <iradiumviking> the problem with streaming and vods is that it still needs extreme ammounts of 

bandwith and it is still not that cheap 

[12:07] <sam_scratch> get anything good for Christmas? 

[12:07] <arcticsurface> Sup doods 

[12:07] <nich2440> no one kills youtube because people still go there for videos 

[12:07] <signintouseapp> merry Christmas phil 

[12:08] <arcticsurface> Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas everyone! Kappa 

[12:08] <derichloveslemur> Phil so this IRL stream will be here on twitch only that right? That way everyone 
can watch the past broadcast. 

[12:08] <royalfan> I still go there to watch phils vids 
[12:08] <mk4eva> whelp gtg. once again, Merry Xmas to y'all :) 

[12:08] <darksydephil> YouTube will still exist, but it’ll be 100% garbage drama vlogs and crappy daily bullshit 
that nobody cares about, the ultimate fluff website that you can ignore and miss nothing 
[12:08] <omgzelda> this video game Christmas music is pretty cool 



[12:08] <thatanonyraccoon> Youtube NEEDS to exist 
[12:08] <skooma_dealer> tfw i remember old you tube 
[12:08] <thatanonyraccoon> i need Tommy Wiseau interviews :( 

[12:08] <skooma_dealer> feels bad man 

[12:08] <leewanner> I'm eating Warhead sour candy canes, doods. Amazing stuff. 

[12:08] <darksydephil> everyone else will go to the amazon VOD site, its too late, theres far too much negative 
association with youtube for it to continue 
[12:08] <skooma_dealer> im so fucking old 
[12:08] <dinohans> yes its true 

[12:08] <exduckcaliber> @darksydephil Phil will you upload the irl part to YouTube? 

[12:08] <psyoctopi> more wrestling 

[12:08] <skooma_dealer> lol i was in high school when dial up was a thing 
[12:08] <skooma_dealer> LUL 

[12:08] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> @ThatAnonyRaccoon I need cat jumping fail videos 

[12:08] <convertedclone> I dunno about that. I'm sure 95% of the public has no problem with youtube 

[12:08] <nich2440> i just upload to youtube and embed the videos on my website 

[12:09] <darksydephil> yes, thsi video will be uploaded to my vlogging channel, it'll be demonetized but 

whatever 

[12:09] <suckasurprise> @ThatAnonyRaccoon Tommy is getting involved with social media these days, you 
should check out his twitter it's hilarious 

[12:09] <thatanonyraccoon> Youtube will live on for awhile, it's got too much content already for the masses to 
abandon it 

[12:09] <psyoctopi> atpQuan 

[12:09] <iradiumviking> if not someone creates some nifty p2p videosharing service that don’t require 
enourmous datacenters to share videos. 

[12:09] <signintouseapp> Amazon have taken youtube off the kindle fire stick 
[12:09] <skooma_dealer> im proly one of the few people that understands phils jokes 
[12:09] <derichloveslemur> @darksydephil how about leaving it as a past broadcast too 
[12:09] <thatanonyraccoon> @suckasurprise thanku, i can't get enough of Tommy 
[12:09] <high_altitude_cain> forsenE 

[12:09] <skooma_dealer> since we are pretty much the same age 
[12:09] <wilkos802> hello 
[12:09] <skooma_dealer> herro 

[12:09] <thatanonyraccoon> Tommy plays video games and has a Machinima for playing games 
[12:09] <royalfan> @darksydephil please keep uploading to YouTube I love watching your videos on there 
[12:09] <darksydephil> RoyalFan i wont' stop unless i have a reason to 
[12:09] <iconicchristian> did the Stream end or start 

[12:09] <pr34ch> well DarksydePhil i dont think google wil care that much if yt would cease to exist 
[12:09] <thatanonyraccoon> Tommy Wiseau playing Dark Souls dspYuck 
[12:09] <skooma_dealer> its starting 

[12:09] <darksydephil> for example, if amazon does make this VOD website and the agreements only allow for 
monetization on one site, then ill have to make a choice 
[12:09] <iconicchristian> ok 

[12:10] <signintouseapp> So Amazon have a video service or something now ? 

[12:10] <thatanonyraccoon> https://twitter.com/TommyWiseau/status/944480938431455233 
[12:10] <skooma_dealer> i love tommy 

[12:10] <nich2440> technically it doesn't need to be on youtube 
[12:10] <wilkos802> so dsp, thoughts on bad santa 2? 

[12:10] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the bathroom, then start presteram 
[12:10] <darksydephil> presteram 

[12:10] <derichloveslemur> So this IRL stream will be saved as a past broadcast nice.

[12:24] <convertedclone> XD 

[12:24] <ccous666> just as good as mgs 

[12:24] <luke2000> The original on the PS1 

[12:24] <hardybuck4> no MGS1? 

[12:24] <signintouseapp> i think a highlight of this year in gaming is when NeoGaf went down :) 

[12:24] <derichloveslemur> Stretch Goal 

[12:24] <theravenorg> @FistmedaddycrikenV2 That's quite the random question, that's all I'm saying. 

[12:25] <deepsolid> thanks for the answer @DarksydePhil 
[12:25] <convertedclone> the word asian is censored> 

[12:25] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> it has to be MGS2 since it was the game that started the TIHYDP bullshit 




[12:25] <heavensward85> Which T-shirt was it, Phil? 

[12:25] <musclesforbones> 10 years or 10 rears? 

[12:25] <deepsolid> imho it has to be MGS just because is goat + the end bossfight

[12:32] <jkramerl331> @me_god what do you mean? 

[12:32] <theravenorg> @ Arctic surface I think the old DSP was more patient, so him attempting flying school

[12:32] <crimsondisco> new to the streams, does Phil always spend like 30 minutes talking about money? :1 
[12:32] <katexo234> egg nog bethe? 

[12:32] <glitch_crazed> Hello everyone, just stopping by to say Merry Christmas! 

[12:32] <bethelewd> kate you know i dont like that 

[12:32] <me_god> in pubg there are times when all you do is run 

[12:32] <ccous666> taxes? wow 
[12:32] <ccous666> sry buf 

[12:32] <derichloveslemur> @arcticsurface ita€™s a Tim Schafer point and click game 
[12:32] <teenagedirtbagl> ferretNULL 

[12:32] <waifudestroyermatt> does phil not realise 95% of the people here are here every day and have heard 
this a million times before 

[12:32] <me_god> in fortnite, you get enemies almost right away 

[12:32] <ningen_sama> @crimsondisco yes LUL 
[12:33] <katexo234> Orange juice then bethe 
[12:33] <devkitgaming> hey everybody 
[12:33] <moonbah> hi TriHard 7 
[12:33] <bethelewd> kate yeah i guess 

[12:33] <jkramerl331> @me_god I know, as soon as I get into a house I get killed, ita€™s so stupid 

[12:33] <convertedclone> but he's more focused on proving himself these days. He’d grind through flight school 
again just to prove he could 
[12:33] <xboxl_is_garbage> Gg 

[12:33] <arcticsurface> @TheRavenORG Thing with Flying School is that you can restart quickly on the fly, 
Phil’s biggest complaint about replaying shit was the driving he had to do to get there. 

[12:33] <omgzelda> im in a turkey coma and hungover FeelsGoodMan 
[12:33] <willhartlO> i just subbed 
[12:33] <arcticsurface> Welcome. :) 

[12:34] <pr34ch> omgzelda drink some wine it helps 
[12:34] <bethelewd> dean ambrose tipped or cheered for phil 
[12:34] <katexo234> PogChamp PogChamp 

[12:34] <theravenorg> @ Arctic surface Yea, that's true. But overall, I'm okay with cheating the end territory gang 
grind, but at least play the last mission legit. 

[12:34] <bethelewd> thought he got injured 
[12:34] <willhartlO> dspHmm 

[12:34] <hobbsl017> goldencolts just wants attention if he wanted to rly support phil he would do 1 big cheer a 
day and leave it at that just my opinion 
[12:34] <bionich00t> ... 

[12:34] <katexo234> golden Colts must be rich 
[12:34] <ccous666> real love 

[12:34] <arcticsurface> @TheRavenORG Yeah, now that im thinking about it i dont even know why i did that 
grind legit, that was boring as hell. 

[12:34] <signintouseapp> does phil have a Switch ? 

[12:34] <heavensward85> If goldencolts really cared, he's tip or buy Teespring. 

[12:34] <theravenorg> @ Arctic surface lowkey I cheated it too lol 
[12:34] <mightyprimel> dsp play jackbox 
[12:35] <derichloveslemur> Merry Christmas @theravenorg 
[12:35] <bethelewd> kte he cheers overnight everyday so yeah must be 

[12:35] <convertedclone> well, doing a bunch of tiny donations supports him and gets attention, so it's a win-win 
[12:35] <arcticsurface> @TheRavenORG I dont think any last mission compares to GTA Ill’s last mission, that 
mission was hell cause the game was archaic as fuck. 

[12:35] <stylez_deneal> Merry Christmas everyone and Phil 
[12:35] <ccous666> @signintouseapp yh mate 



[12:35] <theravenorg> @Derichloveslemur Merry Christmas man! :) 

[12:35] <arcticsurface> Merry Christmas peeps 

[12:35] <thatanonyraccoon> Golden Colts owns a company that sells guns to the Taliban 
[12:35] <convertedclone> yeah gta3's last mission was insane 

[12:35] <concretecasket> cheer 100 merrry Christmas Phil! The playthroughs this year have been sick, cheers to 
another year of streaming. 

[12:35] <bethelewd> COON PogChamp 

[12:35] <theravenorg> @ Arctic surface Yea, the last mission wasn't too hard; which is why I disliked him 
cheating without at least attempting to try it. 

[12:35] <me_god> mhh.. 

[12:36] <me_god> this is confusing 

[12:36] * bethelewd gives coon a Christmas kiss

[12:36] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> goldencolts swims in bitcoin like Scrooge mcduck 

[12:37] <jonathan_snow> so that means double dip the viewers ? not sure how that will work out. 

[12:37] <me_god> what about patreon perks? still the same? 

[12:37] <convertedclone> GoldenColts has 3 bitcoins, that's why he’s so loaded

[13:06] <bethelewd> and a rebel 

[13:06] <katexo234> detractors are mental ill that's sad 

[13:06] <bethelewd> :P 

[13:07] <gezoral999> they should be in federal prison...swatting is a felony 

[13:07] <arcticsurface> But the stupid retarded monkey detractors still have excuses to throw at you to justify the 
hate. LUL 

[13:07] <iradiumviking> all the detractors are cancer. If you don’t like the dude. Go find something you like. 
Don't obsess over someone you don't like 
[13:07] <arcticsurface> "But he is bad at games" 

[13:07] <majinboo3> damn dont tell me she cheated on your ass 

[13:07] <xboxl_is_garbage> If they really wanted to harm you why not hire a hit man ita€™s like 10k for a 
normal person 

[13:07] <me_god> that's kiwifags after all 

[13:07] <channel33> Dumptruck Donnie 

[13:07] <fistmedaddycrikenv2> @katexo234 Can you prove it? 

[13:07] <thatanonyraccoon> detractors are often NEETs and children 
[13:07] <derichloveslemur> Hey @iradiumviking merry Christmas man :)

[13:07] <signintouseapp> It happens phil, i’m divorced. You move on

[13:07] <arcticsurface> Living off mommy's money and in mommy's dark basement. 

[13:07] <lightkunl988> @iradiumviking why do you post at Kiwi Fags? 

[13:08] <convertedclone> well, it's a little extreme to say detractors are mentally ill cause a few people swatted. 
There are just a few crazies out there, like gun owners 

[13:08] <gezoral999> @Thuswindburnl993 not just fuck with streamers...people who swat streamers want them 
dead 

[13:08] <gezoral999> its sick 

[13:08] <derichloveslemur> @iradiumviking lol Christmass 

[13:08] <bionich00t> @Lightkunl988 What is that 

[13:08] <lightkunl988> @iradiumviking just ignore those trolls 

[13:08] <convertedclone> swatters are sickos though 

[13:08] <xboxl_is_garbage> But swatting videos are fun to watch

it caused a shitty chain of events. 



[13:12] <xboxl_is_garbage> Phill you didna€™t make them enough money for them to care you should know 
that 

[13:12] <thebadmatter33> Lol there's no way they said it that way

[13:12] <zahvone> FeelsGingerMan 

[13:12] <fistmedaddycrikenv2> It's funny how you blame one man for fucking up something, but if Phil does it, 
it's the detractors okaaay doood. 

[13:12] <alucardjr69> can we stop with machinima and get to the goodies? what u got for Christmas? what game

[13:13] <jkramerl331> Machine used him to plant a garden, literally treated like dirt 

[13:13] <zahvone> @DarksydePhil What do you want for Chrimmas? 

[13:13] <mudai> @Alucardjr69 he didn't get anything for Christmas, not even his parents or girlfriend sent him

[13:13] <bethelewd> pubg is later 
[13:13] <jkramerl331> Literally 

[13:13] <stinkinburrows> @Grenthorino why the fuck would he do that after what he just said about his ex? 
[13:13] <pwnage_101> @Thuswindburnl993 Well sorry then bro. Guess I jumped the gun too soon.

[13:13] <kinggoken> lol 

[13:13] <me_god> ~700 viewers... and no gameplay. says a lot 

[13:13] <convertedclone> PDP deserves whatever hate he got. A professional can’t just say the n word on camera 
and think they're gonna get away with it 
[13:13] <kushuluck> is phils throat ok? 

[13:13] <stinkinburrows> I doubt they said "how dare you" LUL 

[13:13] <thuswindburnl993> no worries, that's a prime example of why the adpocalypse happened honestly 
[13:14] <thatanonyraccoon> rationalizing mistakes because of ego 
[13:14] <high_altitude_cain> forsenE 

[13:14] <bethelewd> yeah you tell em to go FUCK YOURSELF 

[13:14] <mudai> @ConvertedClone I agree. Sadly he actually got away with it. Lots of people are still watching 
him, it didn’t hurt him at all 
[13:14] <thebadmatter33> lol 
[13:14] <channel33> "ENDED" 

[13:14] <zylax> @Kushuluck theres something hard stuck 

[13:14] <thuswindburnl993> people just assuming he was a nazi whatever the fuck when in reality he just made 



a funny video with an offensive joke in it 
[13:14] <xboxl_is_garbage> Rip 

[13:14] <kmark7> Not sure they said how dare you. You seem to be adding revisionist history. Phil 

[13:14] <lightkunl988> @me_god Every 1 comes for Phi, not just the gameplay 

[13:14] <jkramerl331> @thuswindburnl993 the video wasna€™t funny

[13:15] <jamiepaulbaldwin> is the stream buffering for everyone else too? 

[13:15] <zahvone> no 

[13:15] <thatanonyraccoon> the falling out was because of the adpocalypse basically 
[13:15] <derichloveslemur> @pwnage_101 Are you doing anything for the holidays? 

[13:15] <high_altitude_cain> forsenE forsenE forsenE forsenE forsenEvforsenE forsenE forsenE 
[13:15] <rockumentary> no 

[13:15] <bethelewd> being disrespected by your BOSS and having to deal with that is the same thing so FUCK 
THAT SHIT 

[13:15] <arcticsurface> @Thuswindburnl993 If people think someone is a nazi for saying the n word once then 
people need to get their heads off their asses. 

[13:15] <thatanonyraccoon> and some pretion of integrity 

[13:15] <lightkunl988> @DarksydePhil The Tips are not showing on stream 

[13:15] <thuswindburnl993> @jkramerl331 did you watch the entirety of the original? Becuase I thought it was 
hilarious. 

[13:15] <super_slade> Pewdiepie is kryptonite to funny 
[13:15] <thatanonyraccoon> pretention 
[13:15] <bethelewd> i would quit as well 
[13:15] <thatanonyraccoon> and it only cost him money 
[13:15] <zahvone> @jamiepaulbaldwin restart the page 
[13:15] <maisbauermalte> forsenE 

[13:15] <convertedclone> yep, it's been well proven at this point that controversy doesn't do anything to 
streamers/youtubers. JonTron didn’t lose anything for being a(n arabian) white nationalist 
[13:15] <bash_flastard> Your agent works for you, Machinima didn't work for you, you worked for them. Poor 
analogy phil. 

[13:15] <nich2440> but the adpocalypse wasn’t machinimas doing 
[13:15] <kushuluck> oh ok 

[13:15] <thatanonyraccoon> he’d have a lot more money right now if not because of this 

[13:15] <bentboxer> merry Christmas @Derichloveslemur. are you freezing your chubby springroll off in Canada

[13:16] <thatanonyraccoon> @Nich2440 he was emailing them about the effects of the adpocaly[se 

[13:16] <xboxl_is_garbage> I remember when syndicate and pewdiepie had the same subs, wish syndicate 

would of blown up instead 

[13:16] <theravenorg> I was gone for a while 

[13:16] <bethelewd> coon he also wouldnt need to paay fucking taxes if his tax man didnt fuck him

[13:22] <thatanonyraccoon> that rich cunt 
[13:22] <bethelewd> whoc ares coon about hulk 
[13:22] <rtucker913> Congratulations! 

[13:22] <skooma_dealer> >pounded 

[13:22] <divanerasmus> i pounded dsp in the but 

[13:22] <derichloveslemur> @thatanonyraccoon How about Macho man? 

[13:22] <sardarkh> Twitch advice needed quite a lot of time to sink in his brain 
[13:22] <derichloveslemur> Macho Man Randy Savage 
[13:22] <convertedclone> what about the other advice tho 
[13:22] <aloofone> luptime 

[13:22] <thatanonyraccoon> @Derichloveslemur stupid Macho Man should've hit the brakes 

[13:22] <theravenorg> If Google and Amazon ever go to war our technology will go from 2018 to 3018 within a 

few months 

[13:22] <scruffshark> : ) 

[13:22] <bethelewd> coon i wish he did 

[13:22] <takii> we had allot of work to convince u to go to back to twitch LUL @DarksydePhil 
[13:22] <derichloveslemur> @thatanonyraccoon Macho Man is Awesome. 

[13:23] <scruffshark> Gonna be cooking off and on so I'll be listening in from the background. 

[13:23] <takii> they are at war @TheRavenORG 

[13:23] <hindae> @DarksydePhil Since youre changing patreon, why not change it to be simple multiples of 
votes? $5 for 1, $10 for 2 etc. 

[13:23] <takii> amazon doesnt list google products and google removed it from youtube LUL 
[13:23] <xboxl_is_garbage> 5Y~® 

[13:23] <jkramerl331> So then where is project 7? 

[13:23] <rtucker913> Patrons should be satisfied with what they get, because they at least get something 
[13:23] <iradiumviking> Yes, Listen and belive. I wonderwhere I have heard that before :D 
[13:23] <arcticsurface> Seriously, if all i ever did was watch negative videos about people then of course i’d 
thi nk they are the scum of the earth, it could be the same for any person, not just Phil. LUL 
[13:23] <thebadmatter33> can you disprove the lies? 

[13:23] <provenmac> ela2 

[13:23] <cooter_baggins> that's not true at all, Project 7 was never delivered 

[13:23] <signintouseapp> It shouldnt matter what it says you have done on the internet as people dont have a 
right to judge others, unfortunately they think they do. 

[13:24] <whatzupleutz> @TheRavenORG depends on how they fight the war, we could also take steps back if 
they start to shit like suing each other about patents they bought and shit like that 

[13:24] <theravenorg> @Takii I mean a full blown out war not taking the youtube app off of a tablet lrnao 
[13:24] <aloofone> how long has he been streaming? 

[13:24] <deluxeboi> what about sunshine? 

[13:24] <convertedclone> the problem is paying that much money for just a trailer is a little much 
[13:24] <deluxeboi> persona 3? 

[13:24] <superslygaming> i think trolls forget there is a real person behind who theyre trolling 
[13:24] <jkramerl331> What happened to project 7 money? 

[13:24] <takii> not listing google products on the amazon site is a pretty big deal @TheRavenORG 

[13:24] <katexo234> there's some guy on YouTube who makes negative videos about Phil like everyday like daq 

fuck NotLikeThis 

[13:24] <theravenorg> Let's be honest here though, BOTH google and amazon would fall to Disney. That damn 
mouse smh 

[13:24] <rtucker913> He had legit reasons to do all those "bad" stuff 

[13:24] <8pac37> Yo dsp what's going on my brother? Still begging for money I see... 

[13:24] <superslygaming> KappaPride ill partner with u phil 



[13:24] <derichloveslemur> @theravenorg Twitch is better than YouTube because you get behind the scenes. 

[13:24] <me_god> the goal wasn’t for the full project 7. it was for a trailer that didn’t work out. persona 3 was 

supposed to be a lOhr playthrough 

[13:24] <suckasurprise> I think a lot of people only see the negative side from detractor videos that skew 
everything to make Phil look bad, if they actually checked out his stream they'd realize he’s actually a cool guy 
[13:24] <devkitgaming> hey guys 
[13:24] <convertedclone> LOL 8pac 

[13:24] <trihard41iife> @katexo234 honestly I’d be laughing to have people make videos about me daily, they 
spend their life on me LUL 

[13:24] <takii> TBH all would fall to TENCENT. They are taking over everything WutFace 
[13:25] <jkramerl331> @8pac37 hahhahaha 

[13:25] <xboxl_is_garbage> Disney is one of the 5 companies that owns everything so yeah 
[13:25] <theravenorg> @Derichloveslemur I like youtube a bit more because imo creativity strives there 
[13:25] <trihard41iife> @suckasurprise yeah dsp is chill person i think 
[13:25] <convertedclone> yeah fuck disney 

[13:25] <takii> Tencent literally owns almost everything worth owning LUL 

[13:25] <theravenorg> Disney vs Amazon vs Google vs SpaceX would probably be the most lit time of our lives 
[13:25] <rtucker913> It doesn’t quite work on YouTube, but if you’re happier on Twitch, I won’t stop you 
[13:25] <jkramerl331> Is it really a business when you ask for donations? 

[13:25] <derichloveslemur> @theravenorg yeah very true. 

[13:25] <convertedclone> he’s chill til he plays ultra street fighter 2 hehe 

[13:25] <devkitgaming> @darksydephil have you heard of legends of the internet 

[13:26] <rtucker913> They're trying to get material to slander and libel you with 

[13:26] <pseudeenym> that happens on every twitch chat 

[13:26] <ihav4gotn> MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE & PHIL 

[13:26] <nightbot> ihav4gotn -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[13:26] <skooma_dealer> well now that he got the lk tip do we get mgs 2 and 3 now? 

[13:26] <trihard41iife> @ConvertedClone I don’t watch dsp play multiplayer., so negative lol 

[13:26] <hindae> This is why you should play more indie titles. You can talk to the chat more and its a more 

relaxed kinda deal 

[13:26] <zahvone> WTF, Twitch is streaming NFL games now for free! 

[13:26] <provenmac> elaHi

[13:26] <derichloveslemur> Merry Christmas 5YZ„ 

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> since that lk would push him to the stretch 
[13:27] <provenmac> elaOh

[13:27] <skooma_dealer> :) 

[13:27] <nolbert87> @Zahvone really where how?

[13:27] <trihard41iife> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce skin., rofl 
[13:27] <skooma_dealer> :) 

[13:27] <superslygaming> i think twitch fit phils content better 

[13:27] <signintouseapp> You would do well to relax and read chat more going forward, you tend to talk at us 

[13:28] <rtucker913> Looks like a patch of skin to me 

[13:28] <skooma_dealer> he rubs his chin too much he rubbed the hair off 

[13:28] <vendatus> white sauce Kappa 

[13:28] <suckasurprise> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce It's cookie crumbs from the cookies he left out for Santa

[13:30] <aloofone> i thought he wasn't going to talk about his old gf 

[13:30] <signintouseapp> Success on Twitch needs a lot of networking with other streamers, you are kinda out 
here on your own imo 
[13:30] <adr525> :o 

[13:30] <jkramerl331> Relying on people to donate is a dangerous way to survive 

[13:30] <me_god> that's a good question. 

[13:30] <randydeg> Zahvone i’m a stream director at inception 

[13:30] <rtucker913> Why did you get engaged if the relationship was like that, then? 

[13:30] <ningen_sama> Leanna :( 

[13:30] <zahvone> @Randydeg Even smaller world! Wow dude, awesome, lol 
[13:30] <vendatus> it's Happy Christmas dspPepe 
[13:30] <convertedclone> it's not a reveal if it was already obvious tho

[13:30] <derichloveslemur> @nolbert87 Ia€™ve been very busy during Christmas Ia€™m sick too 
[13:30] <ningen_sama> I miss Leanna and her saops :( 

[13:31] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Ita€™s hard when you work a lot it can be stressful 

[13:31] <whatzupleutz> @me_god yes actually, I have some friends that really enjoy those games and played 

them multiple times, in eluding stuff like mgs4 on "the boss" difficulty, I think I have a grasp 
[13:31] <bethelewd> ven merry Christmas is it how dare you say it WTONG

[13:52] <gottisttotl> No way she cheated that bitch 

[13:52] <monkeybutt209> Ok cool just got done with our Christmas 

[13:52] <rtucker913> And the thought that we will all die also reminds me that the world will end and humanity 
will go extinct and the songs will not exist anymore, and echo through the halls of the abandoned buildings. Yes, 

I live in Deepville USA, why do you ask? 

[13:52] <skooma_dealer> two sides to a story fam a lamer 
[13:52] <fishermanbejeezus> injecting heroine on Christmas

[13:52] <kinggoken> new sub hype 

[13:52] <frogsonic> @Gezoral999 boogies wife doesn’t like sex Kappa 
[13:52] <myathebeez> Boogie is a cuck. totally different. 

[13:52] <derichloveslemur> @stinkinburrows I pretty much prefer without the video of the fireplace. Cause 
showing fire can be dangerous, 

[13:52] <fishermanbejeezus> @Skooma_Dealer low supply 
[13:52] <skooma_dealer> 

[13:53] <zhulthemighty> @Gezoral999 How can u mix up boogie and DSP? boogies clearly way skinnier 
[13:53] <fishermanbejeezus> @Skooma_Dealer got skooma? 

[13:53] <stinkinburrows> @Derichloveslemur dangerous? wtf? LUL 
[13:53] <convertedclone> I got myself a Vive for Christmas 

[13:53] <channel33> i just finished my character. Dumptruck Donnie from North dakota 

[13:53] <skooma_dealer> @FishermanBejeezus always 

[13:53] <dustyfeet> caring about the lives of streamers LuL 

[13:53] <sub41evo> boogiel488 

[13:53] <sub41evo> is a act 

[13:53] <channel33> Skooma ooma ooma 

[13:53] <gezoral999> why do you watch streamers if you don’t care about their lives 
[13:53] <derichloveslemur> @stinkinburrows Fire is pretty dangerous. 

[13:53] <kinggoken> Boogie needs to hit da gym....like Low...tier..gawwddd 
[13:53] <fishermanbejeezus> @Skooma_Dealer SeemsGood 
[13:53] <sub41evo> i mean the being a cuck part is not 

[13:53] <rtucker913> But mostly it makes me sad because I reflect through the year and regret being a horrible 
person 

[13:53] <stinkinburrows> a video of fire is not dangerous in any way 

[13:54] <sub41evo> but boogie uses words and says things in his streams he would never put on his youtube 
[13:54] <rtucker913> And the somber tunes remind me of that 
[13:54] <sub41evo> would trigger morons 

[13:54] <jiv_> i didn’t even know they broke up till now, and i’m a fan, lol 
[13:54] <sub41evo>. 

[13:54] <nightbot> sub41evo -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning]

[13:54] <kinggoken> it was pretty interesting 
[13:55] <chrishansenscookies> lame 

[13:55] <me_god> getting cucked is not the problem, women are strange creatures, but acting like a cuck is 

when a guy needs to rethink his life 

[13:55] <jiv_ > hark the king of hatred sing, glory to the hateful king 

[13:55] <rtucker913> Come back, Phil. I wanna be cheered up. I don’t wanna remember being a horrible person 
and the world ending :( 

[13:55] <fishermanbejeezus> @me_god humans are weird and complicated. I'm screwed up 

[13:55] <kinggoken> everytime i read the word Cuck I think of low tier God 

[13:56] <gezoral999> this music reminds me of my alcoholic father during Christmas and makes me sad 

[13:56] <me_god> you can be the Alpha-est guy in the world, but if she wants something you can't give her, 

she goes and nothing you can do

[15:04] <scoopula> The tax cut is only temporary if they don't renew it in 10 years, which they would do unless 
democrats obstruct again

[15:56] <derichloveslemur> @DarksydePhil, My Christmas traditions my parents always made for Christmas 
was Roast Turkey with a delicious stuffing and A delicious Hot Pot dinner. 

[15:57] * iradiumviking opens up streamchat 

[15:57] <bionich00t> I grew up in an orphanage and for Christmas, they let us go outside and we had a turkey 
per each 10 kds. I got the drumstick a few years. Every year we'd do a raffle to see who got a present. I never 
won. I was there until I was 18. :( Got my first present from my boyfriend when I was 20 years old. 
@DarksydePhil
