[14:07] <hardybuck4> this game looks fun 
[14:07] <ginosaji8> PogChamp 

[14:07] <quinn800> @TheAdamlee23 honestly they dont have one 

[14:07] <bethemadeagle> i just stayed at the beginning of the map and shot rockets with boba and murdered luke 
so bad it was funny 

[14:07] <veramer> i mean he has one heal ability, hes not really a main healer or whatever 
[14:07] <chaosalltheway> there's no variety in gameplay if ya played DR yourself and watching stream. It makes 
sense tho if you want to enjoy Phils reactions etc 
[14:07] <theadamlee23> Really? 

[14:07] <ihav4gotn> PogChamp 

[14:07] <bobbi_ling> if you read bobas lore hes a good guy but works for empire dspHmm 

[14:07] <quinn800> @TheAdamlee23 yup 

[14:07] <bethemadeagle> 2-1 to me jimbob 

[14:07] <theadamlee23> Usually there's one each in the last game. 

[14:07] <jannedaarcl35> I liked Danganronpa because Phil had great commentary 

[14:08] <butter_my_bread> he needs some adjustments tbh. Vader how too much hp n dmg 

[14:08] <grsicki> what if i told you that i've never seen star wars 

[14:08] <veramer> EA doesnt even want to save BF2, they want people to forget about it so they can go back to 
mobile games 

[14:08] <theroguemarksman> @TheAdamlee23 thats what I liked about phil Daganranpa playthroguhs 
[14:08] <bethemadeagle> bobbi he is a bounty hunter he works for whoever can pay him the most for the 
bounties 

[14:08] <ginosaji8> Stifler's mother is villains healer Kappa 
[14:08] <hardybuck4> you like the game so Phil? 

[14:08] <ihav4gotn> vohiyo50 what drugs have you done?

[14:23] <bobbi_ling> shout out to bobbi fett for being you 

[14:23] <chairmancaleb> I really don't think the prequels were THAT bad. THey obviously didn’t match the 
original trilogy, but they weren’t some terrible thing at the same time. I've watched them all with a cleann ind as 
an adult and I think a lot of it is just extreme over reaction.

[14:23] <breath321> what's phils stance on the p2w lootboxes? 

[14:23] <bobbi_ling> empire strikes back will always be my fav 
[14:23] <dandarkl 1> heroes are way op 

[14:23] <hidiebyel> why is dsp still shit at gaming after so many years gaming 
[14:24] <jannedaarcl35> episode 3 was the only decent one 
[14:24] <bethemadeagle> that is my fav too bobbi 
[14:24] <bobbi_ling> dont agree with me beth 

[14:24] <lbuttondash> @HiDieByel at least he doesn't eat shit like you 

[14:24] <chaosalltheway> LotR 3rd movie was the best one too 

[14:24] <jannedaarcl35> i think empire strikes back is pretty much everyones favorite 

[14:24] <breath321> @HiDieByel to improve you have to actually identify what your faults are, phil just plays a 

lot and doesnt think too hard about it, nothing wrong with that 

[14:24] <nubcakefactoryy> Hey Phil what's the update on the tax situation 

[14:24] <quinn800> i think the first three are over rated the first movie is droids walking through the desert for 
half the movie 

[14:24] <bethemadeagle> bobbi but my fve is empire though 
[14:24] <deepdrive3254> empire is almost everyones favorite 
[14:24] <bobbMing> episode 3 is actually the worst 
[14:24] <jannedaarcl35> but i also enjoyed RotJ 

[14:24] <hidiebyel> @lButtonDash i earn 3x more moeny than this bug 
[14:25] <bobbi_ling> aka 6 
[14:25] <lbuttondash> lol 

[14:25] <bethemadeagle> return of jedi is my second fave 
[14:25] <bobbi_Jing> 4 and 5 are best 

[14:25] <lbuttondash> and what's that gotta do with anything? 

[14:25] <firestormr76> @HiDieByel then you can eat even more 
[14:25] <quinn800> @deepdrive3254 my fave is 2 
[14:25] <lbuttondash> i bet you don't earn more than me

[14:25] <bobbi_ling> new hope was good it introduced you to the universe 
[14:25] <quinn800> @BetheMadEagle its pretty bad 

[14:26] <lbuttondash> money doesn’t mean everything u could make 6 figures and be broke 
[14:26] <bethemadeagle> i like revenge of the sith better than new hope 
[14:26] <lbuttondash> look at Tyrese lol 

[14:26] <quinn800> @Bobbi_Ling the new looks like it will be a favorite 

[14:26] <bethemadeagle> now attack of the clones was shit and phantom menace even worse 

[14:26] <breath321> @lButtonDash Yep you're 100% right, if you don’t know how to spend your money wisely, 

doesn’t matter how much you earn 

[14:26] <bobbi_ling> only good part of ep 6 is boba in jabas palace, after that scence movie sucks

[14:28] <chaosalltheway> not THAT old tho 

[14:28] <chairmancaleb> Arkham Knight is still a little buggy on PC. They didn’t manage to completely fix 
everything from what I understand, just the game breaking bugs for the most part.

[14:28] <bobbi_ling> #whats the best star wars movie 

[14:28] <lbuttondash> why do heroes cost 6k sometimes and then sometimes they cost 8k? 

[14:28] <plizzat5> did you go shopping on black friday phil? 

[14:29] <breath321> @lButtonDash No real reason, it's arbitrary 
[14:29] <darthradovanviking> thhe empire strikes back

[14:29] <segregate> nothing 
[14:30] <breath321> nothing 

[14:30] <butter_my_bread> not worth all the hubbub

[14:30] <grsicki> radovan karadzic is that you? Kappa 

[14:30] <bethemadeagle> wrong 

[14:30] <darthradovanviking> it did it ended with luke not turning to the dark side 



[14:30] <darthradovanviking> which would have been the realistic course 

[14:30] <lbuttondash> lots hated the ewoks 

[14:30] <bethemadeagle> vidar stop being bobbis bae 

[14:30] <lbuttondash> especially back when the movie came out 

[14:31] <bethemadeagle> at this point vidar and bobbi might as well kiss 

[14:31] <darthradovanviking> I am though. In my dream world you are bobbi's best friend bethe 

[14:31] <bobbi_ling> ewoks ruined star wars like dragons ruined skyrim 

[14:31] <bethemadeagle> vidar who says we arent best friends 

[14:31] <bethemadeagle> bobbi is wrong 

[14:32] <bobbi_ling> :D 

[14:32] <breath321> Did phil ever talk about his stance on the p2w lootboxes in this game? I thought he was 
against them but he bought the game apparently 

[14:32] <lbuttondash> skyrim was all hype, i never got into it, i tried a couple times, it never grabbed me 
[14:32] <nubcakefactoryy> Phil play something else 
[14:32] <sethl89> A 

[14:32] <theycallmejimbob> he did it he actually did it :o 

[14:32] <bethemadeagle> i played skyrim too much so i liked it 

[14:32] <bethemadeagle> 2-2 jimbob 

[14:32] <bobbi_ling> im g;lad i didnt buy this tbh 

[14:33] <infinitehypel02> play need for rocks

[14:33] <blue_blur64> @Breath321 Take a look at the podcast he did on Thursday 
[14:33] <lbuttondash> fallout new vegas is one of my favorite games ever 

[14:33] <breath321> @lButtonDash I disliked the main story, the "chosen one" thing is so played out in games 

[14:33] <chaosalltheway> Skyrim had so much content, more than any game I played 

[14:33] <grsicki> skyrim was hype but like 7 years ago, back then for that time it was very good

heavy is better for learning maps

[15:44] <derailedwingnut> cheer200 If you plan on doing a throwback fan appreciation in the future you should 
go back and play Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer in all its hacked glory. That was the game that helped me find

Battlefront forumla and just add the better engine xD 

[16:12] <chickendinner_91> I like my women with tits and ass 

[16:12] <quantumquinn> the first thing I tell a woman during a date is "I'm a Virgin be gentle"

[16:12] <afarcryaway> @Sethl89 It would've cut the development time in half as well xD

[17:16] <thatanonybear> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 I only want the best for Phil. I can understand why he’d think 
you're trolling 

[17:17] <thatanonybear> no offense to you :P Phil has been scorned in the past, he's very apprehensive. 

[17:17] <peterparkerthegod> did the stream just go off? 

[17:17] <thatanonybear> It went off about 12 minutes ago, he’ll be back in a little over 2 hours
