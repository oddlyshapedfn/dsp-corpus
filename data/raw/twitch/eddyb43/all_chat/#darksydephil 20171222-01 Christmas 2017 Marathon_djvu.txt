[13:34] <bionich00t> In fairness you need a high IQ to understand Phil's commentary. The amount of 
renaissance references, scientific terms he alludes to, literature knowledge necessary to process his jokes. Only 
graduate of Harvard or Yale would be able to fully appreciate the humor in his commentary.

Tomba! and Tomba! 2 sometime. Loved those games.

[13:48] <i_came_here_to_something> @XXXNemesisXXX Nice! I have to get it off Steam sometime. But 
overall I wouldn’t say Klonoa is that hard if you're used to 2D platformers. Tomba! and Tomba! 2 are kind of 
cryptic in what to do next and jumping feels more like in the Ghouls 'n Ghosts series. But it's still easy to get 
used to.

[13:54] <bionich00t> To be fair you need a high IQ to understand Phil's commentary. The depth of his 
references, to Greek philosophers, ancient mythological figures and Scientology dianetics is beyond the 
understanding of the typical pleb. Only a select few, the top 0.01% of the intelligent elite can possibly 
comprehend DSP's humour in its entirety.

differently.

GBA emulator 

[16:49] <glitch_crazed> That way he at least fulfills all the games he bought

[17:00] <ubska> @SolyyloS Anyone call a medic? 

[17:00] <eternia_forever> @ThatAnonyRaccoon no 
[17:00] <g4s_pharaoh> His demographic is like 14 year olds 
[17:00] <solyylos> nope 

[17:00] <yaanul> I wonder where Phil got these chiptunes from. 

[17:00] <popsicolo> That crackling sound is Phil. He accidentally immolated himself. 

[17:00] <insaiyan9000> hes imagining himself cleaning still 
[17:00] <theycallmejimbob> not too sure now Derichloveslemur tbh 
[17:00] <thatanonyraccoon> Phil is roasting over an open fire 
[17:00] <fluffynioochicken> @Yaanul me too 
[17:00] <derichloveslemur> Oh gotcha 
[17:00] <g4s_pharaoh> Dona€™t drink kids 
[17:00] <musclesforbones> did phil pass out? 

[17:00] <insaiyan9000> phone sex? 

[17:00] <yaanul> Like ten years ago, I remember Something Awful sharing a Christmas chiptune album, but I 
don’t think this is it. 

[17:00] <thatanonyraccoon> apple in his mouth

[17:02] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Phil hasn't even touched Santa's butt yet 

[17:02] <fhrffymoochicken> Fol that's funny. Elf Bowling was popular enough to get a movie? 

[17:02] <ubska> @Eternia_Forever Whats the drink goal? 10 would be lit af 

[17:02] <sam_scratch> he only bought 4 in total he showed us on twitter ....how do you get 7 

[17:02] <elfbowlling> ik but stop talking about him he's irrelevant. 

[17:02] <shousan> I have no clue what Phil weighs but everything above 80 kg should be able (easily) to handle 
5-8 beers (6-9%) with just the mass 

[17:02] <thatanonyraccoon> @fluffymoochicken Queer Duck and Teacher's Pet were popular enough to get 
movies too lol

[17:21] <yaanul> @Glitch_Crazed The problem is that Phil was looking for holiday/Christmas games, but there 
really aren't all that many out there. 

[17:22] <londorgael> he should have played a hacked pokemon rom with only ice type pokemon 
[17:22] <thatanonyraccoon> @Gettwobirdsstonedatonce @fluffymoochicken night fam Race Attack

everyone paid for phils interaction? honest question 

[18:10] <kozatof> Those 15 hour skype calls Fred did was escorting

mission.

[18:29] <splatoon7> Kappa 
[18:29] <sirnoblex> lol @splatoon7 

[18:30] <yaanul> I think the next time that a drinking stream happens, Phil needs to have a set of drinking-game 
rules to keep himself drinking over the course of the stream, rather than just taking occasional sips. 

[18:30] <leelookorben5the> Ohhhh, Texas 

[18:30] <chrishansenscookies> or v8 drinks 

[18:30] <kovorus> All my exes live in Texas

[18:31] <thatanonyraccoon> dayum, if only i had Overwatch too :( 

[18:31] <splatoon7> so maybe a coffee stream would have been better?

[18:31] <leelookorben5the> I can’t @ you kek's - disappointed mate :P 

[18:31] <kozatof> What does that even mean 

[18:32] <bernielomax517> USB deviced to death LUL 

[18:32] <blk_mage_ctype> holidaycheerlO Someone should tell Pops to increase his Mic volume, it sounds like

[18:32] <kozatof> @leelookorben5the you said ahaha vodka. Is that good 
[18:32] <eternia_forever> @iradiumviking yeah that is what i was thinking 

[18:32] <yaanul> @iradiumviking Like I said, Phil needed something to keep him drinking over the course of 
the stream, rather than whenever he was thirsty. 

[18:32] <thatanonyraccoon> Pops sounds like the microphone on the PS4 controller 
[18:32] <leelookorben5the> I’ve never had it @kozatof

[18:33] <leelookorben5the> ahah @kozatof I wanna go there one day :P 
[18:33] <majinboo3> they need to get that one troll from the zombies gameplay 
[18:33] <majinboo3> he was a camping bitch 

[18:33] <thatanonyraccoon> @Popsicolo youre not saying anything so we can't tell 
[18:33] <danznewz> USB bug sounds like a new Transformer. 

[18:33] <thatanonyraccoon> @Popsicolo about the same 
[18:34] <iradiumviking> did you bting your flex tape @Popsicolo 
[18:34] <nikiboo32_> overwatch was a mistake period 
[18:34] <kovorus> A 
[18:34] <jetset3000> ye 

[18:34] <pinkdam> what are your thoughts on the number of USB devices Phil has connected? 

[18:34] <majinboo3> phil was bad at overwatch when he was playing it every week let alone when hes drunk as 
fuck 

[18:34] <iradiumviking> :D 

[18:34] <majinboo3> and rusty as hell 

[18:35] <electrumguy> wow, he is horrible at overwatch lol 

[18:35] <kozatof> @leelookorben5the Ia€™ll give you tour when you come over 

[18:35] <shousan> @Yaanul It's easily calculated. If Phil weighs more than 80 kgs he can easily consume 14 cl 



of 100% alcohol which converts to 6-8 beers and he would feel nothing (unless allergic) 

[18:35] <thatanonyraccoon> @majinboo3 he's buzzed lol, i think he could legally drive right now 

[18:35] <snipertheladiesman> feeding the enemy 

[18:35] <zangba> Wish Phil would play Competitive 

[18:35] <thatanonyraccoon> he should have bought a breathalyzer 

[18:35] <snipertheladiesman> lv6ing yhe enemy is not good 

[18:35] <bernielomax517> Lol 

[18:35] <leelookorben5the> I'm wondering why it would come up anyway @Pinkdam - I'm assuming the PS4 
only has a couple, so therefore it should support all USB ports dspShock 
[18:35] <majinboo3> in china they say chick chang wang 

[18:35] <ellffymanl23> cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl cheerl would you 
recommend purchasing santas butt (the beer) 

[18:35] <jetset3000> hehe 

[18:36] <leelookorben5the> my aunty has been to Izhevsk @kozatof apparently it is nice? 

[18:36] <yaanul> @Shousan That's interesting. Phil says he weight around 1501b, which is around 68 kg. 

[18:36] <yaanul> At least, I vaguely recall him saying so. 

[18:36] <kozatof> @leelookorben5the ita€™s not bad 
[18:36] <majinboo3> what phil said he weights 200 lol 
[18:36] <yaanul> also, I meant "weighs". Kappah 
[18:36] <nikiboo32_> we only do freedom units here in chat 
[18:36] <shousan> @Yaanul 68 kg lol!!!!! 

[18:36] <yaanul> @majinboo3 Did he? Again, I honestly forget. 

[18:36] <yoitsque> you think phil weights 15 pounds? 

[18:36] <yoitsque> 150 
[18:36] <yoitsque> LUL 

[18:36] <shousan> @Yaanul that is a kids witght 
[18:36] <dreamcatalog> lol 

[18:36] <rjl7opticreaper> lol no offense but hes over 150 
[18:37] <dreamcatalog> is he a manlet or. what 
[18:37] <fugfknmugly> UULLLT lol gg 

[18:37] <majinboo3> idk in uk where everyone is skinny as fuck they weigh like 40kg 
[18:37] <majinboo3> they have no muscle 
[18:37] <bernielomax517> now CHUG 

[18:37] <majinboo3> i would say the average weight in america is 80 kg

[18:37] <kozatof> Phil weighs enough to be a big guy

[18:43] <kozatof> That guy 

[18:43] <majinboo3> overwatch sucks so much now 

[18:43] <yaanul> @yoitsque It's because console controllers aren't as quick/sensitive as KB+M controls.

[18:44] <factorbactorjr> @Yaanul to be fair you can be godly with a console controller and very quick, but 
precision is the issue 

[18:44] Macroixbbboi> so weird, hearing people trying to have a conversation and one person defiantly refusing 
to engage

[18:53] <lacroixbbboi> @StratManl909 ZZzzzzzZZZZzzz 

[18:53] <fluffymoochicken> I liked the early games the best, Christmas Nights and Home Alone 

[18:54] <kozatof> Wait what 

[18:54] <leelookorben5the> a home alone game? :0 

[18:54] <kozatof> No pubg ? 

[18:54] <i_came_here_to_something> NiGHTS and Home Alone 2 were the highlights for me as well 

[18:54] <kozatof> Where is pubg 

[18:54] <takumibun> WHERES SUNSHINE 

[18:54] <glitch_crazed> He should play Home Alone 2 tbh 

[18:54] <dreamcatalog> pubg can celled 



[18:54] <kozatof> Why 

[18:54] <leelookorben5the> pubg is next @kozatof patience :P 

[18:54] <dreamcatalog> jp he said 5min 

[18:54] <kozatof> But why he end stream 

[18:54] <leelookorben5the> he said why @kozatof :P 

[18:54] <dreamcatalog> different console 

[18:54] <sirnoblex> @kozatof Change game 

[18:54] <fhrffymoochicken> I think it was the first Home Alone and not 2, because it didn’t take place in New 
York 

[18:54] <stratmanl909> i fell asleep at the very start of the stream so i missed a bunch ResidentSleeper 
[18:54] <kozatof> I have the stream muted 
[18:55] <dreamcatalog> oooo 

[18:55] <leelookorben5the> ohh well thats no good @kozatof:( 

[18:55] <kozatof> Feels good man 

[18:55] <leelookorben5the> i didnt know there was a Home Alone game :0 
[18:55] <kozatof> Dona€™t have to hear nothin 

[18:55] <i_came_here_to_something> I'm actually surprised that the Home Alone game looked like it was okay. 
Might gotta play it sometime. NiGHTS is always great but he adapted to it well enough which was good. 

[18:55] <kozatof> Sweet silence 

[18:55] <cardking08> wait, takes break but ends stream? 

[18:55] <dreamcatalog> minin Thelma Lou

[18:55] <sirnoblex> That's why 

[18:55] <fluffymoochicken> DSP works in mysterious ways 

[18:56] <cardking08> @SirNobleX how does that have to do with ending stream to change console?

digitized (Mortal Kombat-style) sprites.

[19:25] <thatanonyraccoon> @LaCroixbbboi it truly was a "happy ending" for him 
[19:25] <yoitsque> ok that was actually funny 

[19:25] <blue_blur64> Obviously the Kinect is the answer to our problems here Kappa 
[19:26] <stratmanl909> wait is there only 1 map? 

[19:26] <blue_blur64> On Xbox yes 
[19:26] <blue_blur64> The desert map is on PC 
[19:26] <frogsonic> dat pop in 

[19:26] <carlos_psp> even my 750ti with i5 is doing better than this 

[19:26] <xboxl_is_garbage> Ita€™s more than goty ita€™s the game of the century 

[19:26] <stratmanl909> so is it actually good on pc 

[19:26] <blue_blur64> But, the devs have said that they'll eventually have both versions meet to the same 

version so that neither version is left behind 

[19:27] <thatanonyraccoon> @StratManl909 nope 

[19:27] <frogsonic> I bet it looks spectacular on the X Kappa 

[19:27] <kingwhiterabbit> The Vector's good with extended mag 

[19:27] <blue_blur64> It's better on PC but still has problems even after the official launch 
[19:27] <londorgael> patreon stretch stretch goal: Xbox X 
[19:27] <blue_blur64> Nah 

[19:27] <genuinelol> this game is so weird to me, i dont get the appeal 

[19:27] <fluffycactus> you can build a pc for the same price of an xbox one x that will play this game perfectly 
[19:27] <thatanonyraccoon> even if this game ran perfectly, I can't call it a good game 
[19:27] <superslygaming> i would hate to play this drunk lol 
[19:27] <thatanonyraccoon> barely even decent 



[19:27] <young_wobblez> Does Phil still own Injustice 2? 

[19:28] <sollesi> I get average of 85 fps with an i5-6600 and n rx 480 

[19:28] <stratmanl909> injustice was eh 

[19:28] <stratmanl909> that whole loot box shit 

[19:28] <frogsonic> I'll get the next Sony console, the Pro looks meh 

[19:28] <convertedclone> Phil’s observations with the slur are LUL 

[19:28] <blue_blur64> I'm sad I missed Phil playing Fortnite brownFEELS 

[19:28] <youngcud> Jesus is lord 

[19:28] <fallenl570> Some games are awesome to play when drunk 
[19:28] <blue_blur64> Recently I got 4 kills in a squad match xD 

[19:28] <coralguy> i just bought ff7 on ps4 on sale right now (nostalgia baby) and it comes with the best free 
dashboard theme ever 

[19:28] <bernielomax517> @YoungCud Not this shit again 
[19:28] <goldencolts> holidaycheerlOO #charity 

[19:28] <stratmanl909> @frogsonic pro is good, you can cook stuff on it Kappa 
[19:29] <young_wobblez> Should i get this or COD i can’t really decide :/ 

[19:29] <blue_blur64> When I was alone on my team. I just pulled up on some people :P 

[19:29] <fluttershyl970> are there Christmas on phill's head i see 

[19:29] <superslygaming> @coralguy that dash music is soo sad sounding tho :( 

[19:29] <blue_blur64> Get COD young, you don’t want an early access game 

[19:29] <blue_blur64> and this year's COD is worth it 

[19:29] <stratmanl909> cod is good 

[19:29] <kingwhiterabbit> Cod sucks 

[19:29] <stratmanl909> the zombies isnt as good imo

[19:30] <vashon91> COWADOOTY IS FOR BABIES 

[19:30] <nightbot> Vashon91 -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning] 

[19:30] <stratmanl909> anybody played the south park die? 

[19:30] <blue_blur64> I'm assuming he was talking about console though @CTE900 DansGame 
[19:31] <superslygaming> i might grab ff9 myself just for nostalgia 
[19:31] <thatanonyraccoon> this game's art style is "cheap Unity assets" 

[19:31] <cte900> i know, just realizing now myself that it's not early access on pc. mostly why i said that 

[19:31] <blue_blur64> these bad houses are full of shit? Sounds about right nappyThink 

[19:31] <young_wobblez> Blue dragon is on sale for $5 on XBOX store BTW 

[19:31] <stratmanl909> ff9 has better battle music then ff7 

[19:31] <kozatof> COWADOOTY IS FOR BABIes 

[19:31] <young_wobblez> i’m really thinking of picking that up but im not really one for JRPG's 

[19:31] <coralguy> phil, your on a mountainwith another guy, about to die, supplies low, what do you do? eat 

him, risk frosbite of the extremities, tautaun his ass to keep warm? 

[19:32] <superslygaming> PogChamp 

[19:32] <thatanonyraccoon> FF9 is superb, very great game 



[19:32] <timboslicegb> so wait they fixed frame rate then next patch they dedtroyed it again? 

[19:32] <thatanonyraccoon> even if you don't like JRPGs, it holds up incredibly 
[19:32] <darkmaggotfua> lol nice hat phil. dspSexy holidaycheerlOO 
[19:32] <stratmanl909> ffB was weird to me 

[19:32] <blue_blur64> I’d offer my own leg @coralguy , I’m not that greedy 
[19:32] <coralguy> @ThatAnonyRaccoon never played always been a ff7 and ffB guy 
[19:32] <kingwhiterabbit> Guns have less recoil now 
[19:32] <kingwhiterabbit> still no aim assist though 

[19:32] <superslygaming> im waiting for ff9 to go on sale, it was like 20 bucks last i checked 
[19:33] <thatanonyraccoon> @coralguy it could make you turn on FF8, it's that good, FF8 is weak next to it imo 
[19:33] <thatanonyraccoon> but tbf I was never a FF8 guy 
[19:33] <stratmanl909> ffB had that card battle thing right 

[19:33] <superslygaming> i wonder why they didnt re release ffB lol. only ff7 and ff9 

[19:34] <unusual_doggo> @DarksydePhil you still on this shit what the fuck my nigga? didn't you say you hated 
this game? 

[19:34] <blue_blur64> because 8 is too divisive 

[19:34] <coralguy> @ThatAnonyRaccoon ffB had that killer card game though lol 
[19:34] <kingwhiterabbit> Will you upload the marathon to youtube? I missed it 
[19:34] <convertedclone> because people hate FF8's story 

[19:34] <lacroixbbboi> i would sell your soul @superslygaming for a FF8 remake 
[19:34] <thesecretlifeofdsp> ffB was good 

[19:34] <thatanonyraccoon> @coralguy fP9 has it too, updated, at least i think it's the same cardgame 
[19:34] <elipsion> We need a DSP ffB and 9 playthrough 
[19:34] <superslygaming> lol 
[19:34] <blue_blur64> 9 eventually 

[19:34] <thatanonyraccoon> ff9's cardgame is really good tho 

[19:34] <yolodopper> cheerlO does whisky help coping with cold weather by making you warmer? 

[19:34] <coralguy> Also liked ffx alot despite all the cringe 

[19:35] <superslygaming> i thought ffB was alright, especially for its time it was pretty epic. 4 discs btw lol 
[19:35] <fallenl570> Just throwing it out there, but what about Timeplitters 2 or future perfect? Been watching it 
for nostalgia lately 

[19:35] <thatanonyraccoon> ff9 was 4 discs too, incredible for a PS1 game 
[19:35] <stratmanl909> anybody ever play abe? 

[19:35] <thesecretlifeofdsp> amen @superslygaming 
[19:35] <thatanonyraccoon> i think ff7 was only one disc 
[19:35] <stratmanl909> timesplitters 2 is my jam 

[19:35] <coralguy> @superslygaming yepppp, i remember habing to borrow the third disc from my friend 
because my kept freezing at a certain part (space) 

[19:35] <stratmanl909> never had anybody to play story mode with tho 

[19:36] <fallenl570> ikr @StratManl909 

[19:36] <popsicolo> 123 123 DRINK 123 123 DRINK 

[19:36] <fluffycactus> handguns are good in certain situations they are very stable 
[19:36] <stratmanl909> @Fallenl570 timesplitters rewind should be out soon 
[19:36] <yaanul> Well, I'm heading out for the night. 

[19:36] <yaanul> Peace out, y’all. 

[19:37] <thatanonyraccoon> it doesn't make you warmer, it constricts blood vessels and prevents thermal 
regulation 

[19:37] <pinkdam> they call him machete 

[19:37] <blue_blur64> It honestly looks like the circle will stay around you, so you might as well camp in the 
first house that has good shit in 

[19:37] <thatanonyraccoon> it makes you feel warmer by numbing senses 
[19:37] <thatanonyraccoon> it's like saying painkillers "heal" you 



[19:37] <octanis> ff7 was 3 discs 

[19:37] <popsicolo> Only drink in the cold if you know beyond a doubt you're not going to make it. 

[19:37] <fallenl570> @StratManl909 I heard about it but nothing new yet. I always play against bots myself. 

fucking monkeys kill me every time lol 

[19:37] <superslygaming> lol 

[19:37] <kingwhiterabbit> lol 

[19:37] <zahvone> What the fuck dude 

[19:37] <coralguy> phil i was with you all day brother, good stream 
[19:37] <kingwhiterabbit> Phil have you ever been stranded in a Blizzard? 

[19:37] <i_came_here_to_something> Christmas NiGHTS and Home Alone were lit 
[19:37] <zahvone> Did they turn the resolution scaling down to like 480o 
[19:37] <eternia_forever> sigh 
[19:37] <superslygaming> has he shot anyone yet? 

[19:37] <zahvone> Jesus christ

[19:38] <gokou00> home alone best game eva 

[19:38] <blue_blur64> He's only seen one person and that guy OHKO’d him with a shotgun 
[19:38] <aragorio> But that was the point Phil 

[19:38] <stratmanl909> @Fallenl570 now i wanna play timesplitters 2 
[19:38] <markmccauley> Cheer 1050 

[19:38] <aragorio> To get out of your mind drunk til u accidentaly crash the stream and pass out 

[19:38] <popsicolo> PUBG looks bad on consoles in 2017 as a direct consequence of the Library of Alexandria 

getting destroyed. 

[19:38] <superslygaming> get em phil SwiftRage 

[19:39] <coralguy> i know this is weird but im playing far cry primal now on survivor mode, quite better and 
more immersive 

[19:39] <captcaveman4201> holidaycheerl5 #charity 

[19:39] <zahvone> If they want better performance for right NOW, they should remove a lot of the foliage, or 
reduce the draw distance and shadows. 

[19:39] <carlos_psp> GO! GO! PHIL! 

[19:39] <coralguy> tell them to come in 

[19:39] <fallenl570> @StratManl909 lol what was that 1 map where is was a space station? It was the best for 
capture the flag 

[19:39] <popsicolo> Aren't foliage and draw distance important aspects of this game though? 

[19:40] <zahvone> @Popsicolo Yes they are. 

[19:40] <stratmanl909> @Fallenl570 i jus kinda played the challenges and that, not played it for years 
[19:40] <zahvone> But if the performance right now is more important to the developer and playerbase, I think 
it's a necessary sacrifice for the time being 
[19:40] <gokou00> does pubg look better on the xbox one x? 

[19:40] <zahvone> But I'm not a developer so who knows lol 
[19:40] <superslygaming> wall hacks 
[19:40] <superslygaming> vac ban 

[19:40] <captcaveman4201> yo if you guys get pubg free with xblx you can just call xbox n tell them that they 
didnt include the code and they will send you another one via e mail., gifts for friend :) 

[19:40] <lacroixbbboi> this stream doesn’t feel holly jolly to me :( where's the Christmas hits

snow. From that day on, I styled my hair in a pompadour too. 

[19:41] <captcaveman4201> i feel like this game can use a chainsaw 
[19:41] <bernielomax517> cheer30 #charity 

[19:41] <fallenl570> @StratManl909 same. Last I played was Future Perfect story mode. Most hilarious game

even say Hello some people get so ANGRY from saying Hi

[20:34] <elzorrobot> Help phil 

[20:35] <leonaras> The only thing that gives the N word power is people who get offended by it. 

[20:35] <elzorrobot> What did I miss? 

[20:35] <cookiemonster414> enn phil not a huge fan of pewdiepie but i thi nk he did apologize for that? 

[20:35] <neospartanhesperos9> I would hate to be a millionare and not do meaningful work anymore, sounds

[20:35] <lacroixbbboi> @DarksydePhil called me the f-word 
[20:35] <thatanonyraccoon> @Leonaras and slavery 
[20:35] <takumibun> lol 
[20:35] <thatanonyraccoon> y'know 

[20:35] <chairmancaleb> Nah, you shouldn’t have to apologize for anything you say. If people find it offensive, 
that's their problem. 

[20:35] <fishermanbejeezus> phil looks sad 

[20:35] <i_came_here_to_something> @Leonaras Well, you're not really in the right to say how someone should 
feel about things, just like how they have no authority to say how you should feel about stuff that upsets you :/ 
[20:35] <eternia_forever> gn sweet jack lol 

[20:35] <staticmesh_wav> apologizing does nothing, they want you to grovel at their feet 
[20:35] <thatanonyraccoon> "your words physically harmed me! apologize!" 

[20:35] <nollieflipunderflip> @Leonaras You're right 

[20:36] <pigpc> @ChairmanCaleb that's a very bigoted thing to say 

[20:36] <infinite_55> holidaycheerlOO Hey Phil, just got back. How are you holding up? 

[20:36] <zahvone> The problem is that in todays society, everyone is entitled, afraid, and right. There's no room 
for error, only judgement. 

[20:36] <i_came_here_to_something> That's part of the problem tbh; everything thinks they should have 
ultimate authority over how other people should feel. 

[20:36] <fishermanbejeezus> @Zahvone true 
[20:36] <mis_diego> guys just stop 
[20:36] <mis_diego> STOP 
[20:36] <pigpc> lol 

[20:36] <staticmesh_wav> as a result they are very condescending and passive aggressive 
[20:36] <captcaveman4201> why he skip frags them complain no frags ? 

[20:36] <zahvone> It’s just so sad, you can enjoy the company of someone you disagree with lol

[20:37] <i_came_here_to_something> @Zahvone To an extent. Sometimes the opposing opinions can be too 
much. But these days most people are ready to go for blood if someone even disagrees on a small thing w/ them :/ 
[20:37] <superslygaming> lol 
[20:37] <popsicolo> MORTARS WutFace 

[20:37] <pigpc> @staticmesh_wav I'm gonna write to my congressperson 

[20:37] <leonaras> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Sure i am, its the exct same situation as in harry potter, 
people tiptoe around the name of the main antagonist and it creates more of an issue than just accepting the word 
and using it regularly, in the uk the word Cunt was considered incredibly offensive until people used it so 
fucking much that it lost its meaning. People need to let fucking go and accept a basic sticks and stones 
mentality. This world is far too full of snowflakes at the moment.

[20:41] <cookiemonster414> if there is one thing i dont like about phil is his distain for pewdiepie cause from all 
ive seen hes not a bad guy. 

[20:41] <i_came_here_to_something> @Leonaras I agree with that to a large extent, but you're not gonna 
convince people their emotions are wrong by belittling their emotions. That's part of what I meant earlier w/ 
people thinking they should have authority over other people's feelings. It's almost kinda a form of thought 
policing. 

[20:41] <zahvone> Honestly I think it would be great for him to get on H3,1 never thought about that. 

[20:41] <lacroixbbboi> Streisand Effect in action, folks 

[20:41] <comebackkid232> 9% LUL 

[20:41] <poopshortsjr> Do you watch porn, Phil? 

[20:41] <pinkdam> pewdiepie is great best amnesia player eu 
[20:41] <neospartanhesperos9> Barbara Streisand VoHiYo 
[20:41] <superslygaming> pewdiepie is phils direct competition 
[20:41] <44kpanda> I thought you made Pizza, Phil 
[20:41] <timboslicegb> phil is funny drunk 
[20:42] <44kpanda> you damned liar!

[20:42] <neospartanhesperos9> @LaCroixbbboi Fuck you VoHiYo 
[20:42] <nollieflipunderflip> so drunk LUL 

[20:42] <staticmesh_wav> no people distance themselves from pewdiepie because it's the politically correct 
thing to do... bad for business to associate with someone who said the n word 
[20:42] <fishermanbejeezus> nice hat 

[20:42] <movieswithmark> Cranky old hermit Phil doesn’t have time for talk shows. He doesn’t have time and 
they’re scrubby shows designed to make him look bad. Plus, they won’t pay him. 

[20:42] <lacroixbbboi> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 give me that butthole RIGHT NOW 
[20:42] <elzorrobot> Since when does phil apologize for cussing You WHY 

[20:42] <breadrising69> Dude tylerl has said the f-word tons of times, literally nothing is gonna happen 
[20:42] <zahvone> @Mis_Diego I don’t think it's a commentary on Political views currently. Right now I believe 
it's just conversation about social taboos, etc. 

[20:42] <timboslicegb> phil will ypu do nr 
[20:42] <fluttershyl970> i love a classic drunksydephill

[20:51] <blue_blur64> Hmm, I think I’ll start streaming Fortnite regularly, what do you guys think? nappyThink 

[20:51] <pikatits> ScaredyCat 

[20:51] <timboslicegb> fuck fornite 

[20:51] <zahvone> Fortnite is great 

[20:52] <zahvone> I like that you can play cross-platform. 

[20:52] <blue_blur64> Probably will just use the PS4's streaming service. I don't want to bother setting up my 

capture software for that. It’s a mess brownLUL 

[20:52] <zahvone> It's not too difficult, what are you running? 

[20:52] <blue_blur64> Not that kind of mess 
[20:52] <blue_blur64> I mean a literal mess 
[20:52] <zahvone> Kappa 
[20:52] <zahvone> Wow 

[20:53] <zahvone> Haha, yeah I want to upgrade from Elgato HD60 to the Pro card, or the 4k60 card so I can 

just use HDMI / Displayport 

[20:53] <zahvone> Less cables and such 

[20:53] <blue_blur64> Give you an idea. Right now I have my laptop on a chair right next to my bed (laying 
down right now). 

[20:54] <zahvone> I just have one machine lol 

[20:54] <blue_blur64> To set up my capture. I’d have to put the HDPVR2 on the chair, put my laptop on my bed, 
and have it connect with the max distance between the console, tv, and laptop 

[20:54] <zahvone> My Ryzen stream machine. I use it with OBS and my capture card, so it's all in one system. It 
gets the job done lol 

[20:54] <blue_blur64> There's literally no space for anything else in here 

[20:54] <zahvone> Oh god, yeah I had an HDPvR2 Gaming edition +. It's pretty good for what it is, but there's 
just so many cables man 

[20:55] <zahvone> I feel you, I've been there. I'm running out of space right now as it is lol 
[20:55] <blue_blur64> I had no space to begin with once I left college, this room is really small xD 
[20:55] <zahvone> I don’t even have half a room to work with. I just have a small corner 
[20:55] <zahvone> :(lol
