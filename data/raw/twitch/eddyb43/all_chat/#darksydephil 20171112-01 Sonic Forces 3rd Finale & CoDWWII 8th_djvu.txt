[12:03] <goldencolts> cheerlOO 

[12:27] <darksydephil> wassap 

[12:27] <waifudestroyermatt> my body is ready philip 

[12:27] <waifudestroyermatt> for NFS 

[12:28] <darksydephil> that starts monday 

[12:28] <waifudestroyermatt> yea i know but still hyped 

[12:29] <darksydephil> people told me it's awful lol 

[12:30] <nich2440> then why are you playing it? 

[12:30] <nich2440> why not focus on origins? 

[12:30] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello dspHmm 
[12:30] <minnowpause> what is goin on 
[12:31] <minnowpause> DSP is the best rapper 

[12:31] <theycallmejimbob> Forza 3 Horizon was hilarious if NFS is half as funny it'll be a good PT 
[12:31] <ornightz> still the same song 

[12:31] <tigerflamessssss> sound good ? PowerUpL DansGame PowerUpR 

[12:31] <waifudestroyermatt> doesnt matter if its awful, driving games + phil are the best 

[12:32] <ornightz> s , when he said there was a playlist I’d be expecting more than the usual 4 songs reshuffling 

[12:32] <theycallmejimbob> he has 17 songs iirc dspHmm 

[12:32] <ornightz> this played yesterday 

[12:32] <thatbritishlad_> Why are people trying to put off Phil playing NFS? Let him play what he wants. It 
makes sense to play it since its been a year for something racey. 

[12:32] <ornightz> and now today 
[12:33] <ornightz> this one played friday 
[12:33] <nich2440> cant you snuffle playlists? 

[12:33] <ornightz> it's the same songs over and over hahaha 
[12:34] <scrumbles> everyone dead? 

[12:34] <goldencolts> i am dead 

[12:34] <scrumbles> nice 

[12:34] <theycallmejimbob> dspDeath 

[12:34] <darksydephil> Ornightz , exactly how many good remixes do you think exist? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> the playlist has 17 of them, there were maybe 25 made total, i picked the best ones 
[12:35] <darksydephil> of course they're going to repeat, you may as well state the sky is blue and grass is green 
[12:35] <darksydephil> it's not very productive 
[12:35] <ornightz> agreed. 

[12:35] <waifudestroyermatt> @DarksydePhil alan wake remix 
[12:35] <xeranarth> It's still a step up from silence! 

[12:35] <waifudestroyermatt> wheres that at 

[12:35] <darksydephil> okay then, stop complaining lol 

[12:35] <riley_212> The one that played before this one was dope 



[12:35] <darksydephil> there is no alan wake remix, what your'e talking about is at the end of the game review 
and was never separated into its own video, one person remixed it but it wasn't very good 

[12:36] <waifudestroyermatt> allan, allaaan wake. He'll beat you with his flashlight and talk about his giant snake 
[12:36] <ornightz> before that I’d like to say what other song on the list 
[12:36] <rccolaisdabest> Hi there guys / 

[12:36] <gautyer> is the pubg stream still happening? didn’t follow the events recently 

[12:37] <yolodopper> musical masterpiece 

[12:37] <theycallmejimbob> hello hello rccolaisdabest o/ 

[12:37] <goldencolts> no PUBG stream dspPepe 
[12:37] <gautyer> alright 

[12:37] <sonicwe> cant wait for edgy the hedgey 

[12:37] <thatbritishlad_> @waifudestroyermatt You're right, my brother made the toby the dog alan wake remix. 
[12:37] <ornightz> this one played 4 days straight lol 
[12:37] <korewasugoi> oh boy its sonic trashes' 

[12:38] <darthradovanviking> does it really? 

[12:38] <sonicwe> better than 06 and boom 

[12:38] <theycallmejimbob> but it was the ominous PS4 dashboard music for a year least there is some variety 
now dspHinm even if the remixes are not everyone's cup of tea dspHmm 
[12:38] <darksydegeoff> daddy DSP 

[12:38] <pl4guet4stic> I can't wait to cut myself on today's stream 

[12:38] <korewasugoi> Sonic team rushed the switch port, thats why i dislike it 

[12:38] <waifudestroyermatt> it's quite simple, if you don't like the remixes. Hit mute and you've got legacy 
pre-stream audio 

[12:38] <howlingwolfjoey> Whoo. more Sanix. Xp 
[12:38] <goldencolts> self harm is not the answer 

[12:39] <pl4guet4stic> @KoreWaSugoi Wait what they did? The port is bad? Ahh shit, and I ordered a copy for 
it today. Fuck my life I guess. 

[12:39] <darksydephil> the port is awful 

[12:39] <korewasugoi> its 30fps and some shit on the switch 

[12:39] <darksydephil> it doesn’t even run at a consistent 30fps on switch lol 

[12:39] <korewasugoi> Doom on the other hand is amazing 

[12:39] <pl4guet4stic> @KoreWaSugoi Nooooooooooooooo 

[12:39] <sonicwe> PowerUpL FrankerZ PowerUpR 

[12:39] <rccolaisdabest> oh hi there jimbob / 

[12:39] <ornightz> songs are terrible LUL 

[12:39] <darksydephil> um, DOOM is also locked at 30fps on switch, that's horrendous for DOOM 
[12:39] <theycallmejimbob> slaps howlingwolfjoey with a large trout SabaPing 
[12:40] <waifudestroyermatt> @Ornightz shut your whore mouth 

[12:40] <xeranarth> I'm curious if it'll be at least a stable 30FPS. I'm not playing it since I already got it on PC 
but I’m curious. 

[12:40] <korewasugoi> well its my first time playing doom, so i cant really compare, the motion blur does make 
the 30 smoother 

[12:40] <pl4guet4stic> @DarksydePhil any idea if there's gonna be a patch or anything for Forces? 

[12:41] <sonicwe> theres a patch for super sonic 
[12:41] <korewasugoi> @PL4GUET4STIC prolly not 
[12:41] <sonicwe> day 1 patch tho 
[12:41] <korewasugoi> anything day 1 can go wrong 

[12:41] <pl4guet4stic> @KoreWaSugoi Just wreck my bunghole why won't you, Sega? Well at least I can enjoy 
this game on the road and look like a total Chris-chan. Great. Can't wait. 

[12:42] <korewasugoi> oh yeah EA bought Respawn entertainment. RIP 

[12:42] <theycallmejimbob> damn Doom on the switch is gonna be 60 bucks dspHmm the base price is 30 bucks 
on steam and was sold as low as 10 bucks at one point 



[12:42] <korewasugoi> press F to pay respects 

[12:42] <sonicwe> eabcan burn 

[12:42] <howlingwolfjoey> Why!? QAQ 

[12:42] <sonicwe> EA can burn 

[12:42] <keyboardsmasherl> Catchy song 

[12:43] <pl4guet4stic> EA is literally eating up studios and spitting out the remains, they're so savage it's painful 
for my soul. 

[12:43] <korewasugoi> Titanlootbox 

[12:43] <thatbritishlad_> That laugh doe 

[12:43] <keyboardsmasherl> Fuck EA

[12:43] <xeranarth> O

[12:43] <xeranarth> I've still not forgiven EA for the Ultima series' finale.

<infinite_sphere> never buy an online game day one 

<korewasugoi> if Phil loves Cod this much i cant even imagine Phil playing Pubg 
<aes0411> Why does he need check these things before the stream?

<jetset3000> fuckin EA 



[13:00] <psvfan94> Need for speed tuning has been ruined by a€oetrading cardsa€D □ 

[13:01] <korewasugoi> Rest in pieces Respawn Ent. 

[13:01] <pl4guet4stic> It's almost like they’re enjoying this shit. Bunch of masochists. 

[13:01] <theycallmejimbob> damn didn't know that dspHmm 
[13:01] <jetset3000> hehe 

[13:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Yes, w/ a $5-a-month maintenance fee 
[13:01] <i_came_here_to_something> not that that's a lot tbh 

[13:01] <pl4guet4stic> I wouldn’t mourn for Respawn in all honesty. I’d say they lasted a lot longer than most 
expected. 

[13:01] <mageagainsttheregime> hey @DarksydePhil i think i was wrongfully ban from your twitter recently 
[13:01] <pkradiance> you know what's the saddest part? people will still purchase these said lootboxes and 
whatnot.... 5 Y~£ 

[13:01] <trihard41iife> A message mod or tip 

[13:01] <goldencolts> Phil did you hear about how people are saying lootboxes ruin the entire game of need for 
speed payback cheer50

[13:01] <korewasugoi> Need for speed : no Limits. Was fun first time playing, deleted right as i saw that you 
have to buy virtual Gas in the game’ 

[13:02] <nich2440> this declined payment thing is a known bug for years and sony refuses to fix it. It just fixes 
itself. 

[13:02] <pkradiance> @korewasugoi are you serious5Y~, 

[13:02] <infinite_sphere> Sony hates your money 

[13:02] <netguy503> The dark tower was a bad movie though :( 

[13:02] <korewasugoi> you could just not play NFS 
[13:02] <korewasugoi> how bout dah 
[13:03] <waifudestroyermatt> no 

[13:03] <waifudestroyermatt> it's better than the other options by far 

[13:03] <chairmancaleb> @nich2440, Doesn't it give you that message if you have the two factor authentication 
tied to your account? At least I thought that was the reason why since Sony never accounted for the extra security. 
[13:03] <thatbritishlad_> Have you ever bought games through the PSN Store on the web browser? 

[13:03] <pkradiance> @korewasugoi well if you insist! saves me money

[13:05] <ornightz> why doesn't someone just giv you a digital code of NFS LUL 

[13:05] <thatbritishlad_> @darksydephil Try and purchase Battlefront II on the PSN store in a browser. 

[13:05] <korewasugoi> yeah like a 2-4 hour campaing 

[13:05] <psvfan94> Assassins creed infinite would take place in space 5Y~„

[13:07] <thatbritishlad_> @lastkryptonian94 I agree. 

[13:07] <ornightz> the thing is Debit cards in some places can only have deposits about 10 times a month 
[13:07] <bionich00t> Does that mean 306 x2.5=750 dollars a month from subs alone on Twitch? Nice. 

[13:07] <dragonpoison> tpYGOcreepy

[13:08] <mageagainsttheregime> cheer50 hi phil i think you accidentally ban me from viewing your twitter 
recently 

[13:08] <korewasugoi> im not trying to be a dick, but saying how many subs you have is something that other 
streamers usually avoid talking about., just saying.... 

[13:08] <sonicwe> santa outfit 

[13:08] <trihard41iife> but I'm too broke, yup thst broke 

[13:08] <lastkryptonian94> @darksydephil Why not put your actual PayPal information instead of your PayPal 
debit card information for your PSN Payment Method? 

[13:08] <howlingwolfjoey> @theycallmejimbob eh, i was besy playin Nekojishi. KappaPride 
[13:08] <thatbritishlad_> DrunkSydePhil ! 

[13:09] <bionich00t> Streamers don’t avoid talking about sub numbers 

[13:09] <bionich00t> Most of them constantly brag they have 10000 subs 

[13:09] <trihard41iife> @darksydephil what to do if accidentally banned on Twitter? 

[13:09] <bionich00t> Phil is line 
[13:09] <korewasugoi> ones i watch dont, but whatever 
[13:09] <unizero2kl5> @KoreWaSugoi It is allowed though 
[13:09] <weaponjay> cheerlO 

[13:09] <korewasugoi> begging for subs is not allowed, talking about them isnt 
[13:09] <mageagainsttheregime> cheer25 also have you tried playing bofa? 

[13:09] <korewasugoi> is fine* 

[13:09] <bionich00t> How is he begging? 

[13:09] <rccolaisdabest> Step Up was a good movie 

[13:09] <ornightz> if you trying to pay w/ Paypal all the while you owe them money they can decline your 
payment advances 

[13:10] <gamesfordayys> Phil...you could sell some of your old games to still drink and play games, instead of 
asking people for Patreon money. Just a thought. 

[13:10] <pkradiance> I want to see the sequel Step Out5Y~f 

[13:10] <theycallmejimbob> had to google that game name as I never heard of it howlingwolfjoey :D

this goal?

[13:13] <wjr02003> @darksydephil I know someone who went to get the Farmhouse King. They thought it was 
an overeasy not a fried egg. Not only did they tell him it's a *fried* egg it's delivered to them frozen and they 
nuke it in the microwave. He was like why would they volunteer that information yet they did. 

[13:13] <ornightz> there is no Half-life 3 , it will most likely be called Episode 2pt II 
[13:13] <convertedclone> wait, you still get verbal recognition for 10 bits? 

[13:13] <convertedclone> or do you need 200

[13:33] <thatbritishlad_> What actually is a chilli dog? All we have in the U.K is hotdogs. 

[13:33] <goldencolts> hot dogs are like 4$ for the buns and a decent brand and a can of chili is like 1.55

[13:34] <darksydegeoff> is the frame rate stuttering every once in a while or is that just me 

[13:34] <urboikong> god these games are still shit 

[13:34] <urboikong> they need to give up with 3d sonic 

[13:34] <encelor> chili dog with condenced milk and bleach marinaded onions 

[13:34] <convertedclone> hallway level design 

[13:34] <urboikong> ugly and boring 

[13:34] <danjack007> this is freakin sonic PogChamp 

[13:34] <korewasugoi> Sonic team still cant make Sonic games in 3d 

[13:34] <sonicwe> coin? sonic fanbase triggered Kappa 

[13:35] <psvfan94> I couldna€™t get into these games 

[13:35] <fabulousfabricant> Sonic Team isn't going to just 'give up’ on 3D Sonic when the games still make them 



money 

[13:35] <darksydegeoff> wow these levels seem completely uninspired 
[13:35] <urboikong> he’ll catch you in a temporal loop, you'll always get your coin back

[13:35] <iconicmasterl> Sonic heroes team dark 

[13:35] <nich2440> is it just me or is the the exact same version of sonics stage 
[13:35] <theycallmejimbob> welp dspDeath 

[13:35] <rccolaisdabest> i agree they feel like a dark syde geoff video 

[13:35] <convertedclone> they need to actually put the effort and resources into Sonic that nintendo put into 
Odyssey 

[13:35] <urboikong> no need for platforming or timing 

[13:36] <urboikong> just tap a in mid air and home in on it 

[13:36] <encelor> i thought this game would be 3d and not a 2d style side scroller 

[13:36] <convertedclone> and completely retool the gameplay 

[13:36] <darksydegeoff> hahahahaha @rccolaisdabest too bad 

[13:36] <ornightz> Shadow w/o vehicles or handguns ? 

[13:36] <korewasugoi> Odyssey can run 60fps, this game has no excuses 
[13:36] <urboikong> its made by sega 

[13:36] <fabulousfabricant> "No need for platforming or timing" which is why when he didn't time the thing the 
first two times he died. 

[13:36] <urboikong> thats the only excuse it needs 

[13:36] <korewasugoi> fair point 

[13:36] <urboikong> its not really a rebuttal 

[13:36] <sonicwe> Odyssey has frame issues when moving 

[13:36] <encelor> the name 

[13:37] <encelor> infinite ... sound like a shitty sonic oc 
[13:37] <sonicwe> bearly above 40 fps 

[13:37] <korewasugoi> @sonicwe im getting no noticable drops 
[13:37] <nich2440> yeah this game sucks 
[13:37] <fluttershyl970> so this game pretty meta 

[13:37] <howlingwolfjoey> *slaps @KoreWaSugoi and @sonicwe with a large trout* >:T 
[13:37] <darksydegeoff> @DarthRadovanViking you around bud 
[13:37] <korewasugoi> @sonicwe lowest it goes is like 58 fps 

[13:37] <convertedclone> I expect a completely unbiased opinion from someone named @sonicwe 

[13:38] <gola2222> muhahahaha 

[13:38] * sonicwe kicks joey to space

[13:38] <waeltheprol 15> Hey phil would you recommend this game so far?! 

[13:38] <convertedclone> yep, this upcoming cutscene is the basis for this entire game Jebaited 
[13:39] <sonicwe> i expected an unbiased opinion of Nintendo fan 
[13:39] <nich2440> does this not even have fucking cutscenes? 

[13:39] <urboikong> ugly game, balloon ass animal 3d graphics, repetitive bland music, gameplay that still 

occurs on two axis despite a third dimension 

[13:39] <korewasugoi> lazy game 

[13:39] <psvfan94> This game seems a bit tedious 

[13:39] <korewasugoi> Sonic should just stay 2d, 3d is making thing worse 
[13:39] <xeranarth> Kinda neat hearing this song again. 

[13:39] <urboikong> after the great game that was mania 
[13:39] <howlingwolfjoey> Wait...Is this White Jungle!? owo 
[13:40] <fluttershyl970> shadow the emo hedgehog 

[13:40] <fabulousfabricant> Yeah because those 2D games were totally great and not at all shit 



[13:40] <convertedclone> coin coin coin coin coin

[13:40] <i_came_here_to_something> @KoreWaSugoi Generations and Colors were great 
[13:40] <urboikong> most of the 2d sonic games were great actually

[13:41] <madibased> is that a skunk? 

[13:41] <urboikong> its a jackal 
[13:41] <bionich00t> yes 
[13:41] <encelor> pepe le pew 
[13:41] <urboikong> apparently 

[13:41] <i_came_here_to_something> @KoreWaSugoi Heroes was good. Adventure 1 and 2 were as well. Lost 
World had potential, same w/ Unleashed. But the others are mediocre at best besides Generations and Colors. 
[13:42] <admiralprawn> He's going full Illidan mode. 

[13:42] <convertedclone> cringe good job sega 

[13:42] <waeltheprol 15> um... Hey phil would you recommend this game so far?!

[13:42] <bionich00t> Amazing 

[13:42] <korewasugoi> Sonic mania is related to this game tho 

[13:42] <waeltheprol 15> Hey phil would you recommend this game so far?!.. 

[13:43] <bionich00t> Yeah Infinite's backstory is shit 

[13:43] <speciall23snowflake> no 

[13:43] <supermaymaybros> WE WUZ WEAK 

[13:43] <convertedclone> you gotta donate bits to get him to answer Wael 
[13:43] <korewasugoi> WE WUZ WEAK N SHIET 

[13:43] <waeltheprol 15> Hey phil would you recommend this game so far?!. 

[13:43] <i_came_here_to_something> @KoreWaSugoi It's mediocre at most. Sonic Boom is trash-tier, this is at 
least playable and competent. Problem is there isn’t enough inventiveness w/ the level design. 

[13:43] <howlingwolfjoey> cheerlO Actually phil, more of his backstory is fully explained in the comics 
[13:43] <thatbritishlad_> @waelthepro 115 Try to out a @ and his name then your message, he will notice it 
more. 

[13:43] <connorxcrash> @DarksydePhil I just got here! Sup Phil!! 

[13:43] <speciall23snowflake> wael he dont see if u dont donate bits 

[13:43] <fabulousfabricant> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Way to generalize. Mario has better games than 
Sonic, that's just an undeniable fact, but the best Mario game was back on the SNES and his recent stuff hasn't 
been amazing. Still better than literally any Sonic game ever made 
[13:43] <encelor> wow is CWC working for sega now? 

[13:43] <korewasugoi> @I_Came_Here_To_Something playable? explain the switch port 
[13:43] <encelor> this was just horseshit 

[13:43] <urboikong> they need to add 2d side scrolling to even make it playable 

[13:43] <urboikong> if you removed 2d side scrolling 

[13:44] <urboikong> 30% of the game would be left 

[13:44] <ornightz> Bio-lizard remix LUL 

[13:44] <encelor> when is the cameo of sonichu? 

[13:44] <encelor> LUL

[13:44] <urboikong> and that 30% would be fucking shit 
[13:44] <pkradiance> where's Cream and Big the Cat? 

[13:44] <madibased> this game is one big beginners trap 

[13:44] <xeranarth> Omega will never be as cool as Gamma anyway. 

[13:44] <theycallmejimbob> :D 
[13:44] <thatbritishlad_> Karma xD 
[13:44] <korewasugoi> ??? 

[13:44] <urboikong> thats because the physics are 3d physics 

[13:44] <bionich00t> His jump is a hop 

[13:44] <urboikong> being used for a 2d sidescroller 

[13:45] <speciall23snowflake> i see wael is banned now

[13:45] <fabulousfabricant> @howlingwolfjoey At least make it a nice salmon 
[13:45] <madibased> @thesupervillain543 im low plat lmao 
[13:45] <urboikong> is that the awful fps moba 

[13:45] <i_came_here_to_something> @fabulousfabricant It's the truth though. 3D Mario's been better than 3D 
Sonic more or less. But SMW is overrated imho. I’d put Sonic 3 + Knuckles and Mania over it, easily. Sonic 2 is 
around SMW's level. I’d put SM3 and Yoshi's Island above Sonic 2, and tied w/ 3 + Knuckles and Mania. SMB1 
is archaic and SMB2 (Japan ver.) is just more SMB1. 

[13:45] <pedropatriciol991> the levels are so basic in this sonic

[13:46] <urboikong> everything is basic 
[13:46] <urboikong> UI, music, graphics 
[13:46] <urboikong> soulless 

[13:46] <i_came_here_to_something> @KoreWaSugoi I meant the PS4 and XBO versions. Switch one needs 
work on technical issues, agreed.

[13:46] <admiralprawn> Let's talk about the best Sonic game - Sonic Spinball. 

[13:46] <korewasugoi> @I_Came_Here_To_Something the switch version was rushed 

[13:46] <gutty333> lol dont take this the wrong way but gameplay like this is why people were shocked 

@DarksydePhil beat cuphead

[13:47] <theycallmejimbob> dspShock 

[13:47] <thesupervillain543> phil you jumped right into it that time 

[13:47] <urboikong> a game about speed where you have to move as carefully as possible

[13:47] <urboikong> because going fast is a non option 
[13:48] <encelor> does that midget bat lady still have D cups? 

[13:48] <darthradovanviking> cheerlOO is this the how to die in sonic tutorial LOL 
[13:48] <pkradiance> I see no difference besides graphics with the Switch version. 

[13:48] <i_came_here_to_something> @KoreWaSugoi That is definitely true. The whole game was rushed 
really, or at least this version of it 

[13:48] <sonicwe> people can’t take he beat cup head cause bitch casuals rage quit and he didn’t

[13:48] <convertedclone> cringe 

[13:48] <stinkinburrows> keep tellin yourself that buddy 

[13:49] <fabulousfabricant> @I_Came_Here_To_Something 2D Mario was better than 2D Sonic too. Mario was 

a genre defining thing in both 2D and 3D while Sonic can barely handle either without rose tinted glasses. The 

most iconic thing about Sonic is Green Hill Zone which is why it's always being remade so it can pander to that 

nostalgia that is all Sonic has 

[13:49] <theycallmejimbob> slow and steady Phil 

[13:49] <urboikong> listen to this awesome generic rock

[13:56] <pkradiance> now we get to see what true horror is 

[13:56] <psvfan94> War 

[13:56] <vendatus> too many players LUL 

[13:56] <waifudestroyermatt> @TheRealKingGhidorah since launch 

[13:56] <fabulousfabricant> The lootboxes in Battlefront 2 aren't even that egregious 

[13:56] <thatbritishlad_> They are letting all the kids play first. 5Y~, 

[13:57] <exzander> the servers are down right now phil. 

[13:57] <aes0411> A minute difference is not that bad

VR, and/or some PlaySync games for the PS4?! 

[13:57] <gutty333> @ConvertedClone this time is different since the loot boxes in star wars affect the 

multiplayer gameplay. This impacts heroes and other items 

[13:57] <korewasugoi> ??? what are you bitching about 

[13:57] <211 trill> aes0411 thats what she said 

[13:57] <exzander> everyone is getting errors, the servers are down 

[13:57] <dominonova> I have never seen this and I played 30 mins ago 

[13:57] <str33m> Activision dont want to pay for extra servers 

[13:57] <therealkingghidorah> @WaifuDestroyerMatt there were a few days of solid performance only a few 
though 

[13:57] <convertedclone> but the rate of getting credits is so slow in Battlefront 2 that it takes 40 hours to unlock 
one character 

[13:57] <psvfan94> cheerlOO 
[13:57] <rx93gundamm> dspPepe 

[13:57] <pkradiance> they're incorporating more lootboxes 

[13:57] <opposable> activision have no money for dedicated servers 

[13:58] <convertedclone> I feel you gutty, but he prefers to ignore lootboxes 

[13:58] <twilisparks> the cod experience

[13:58] <voltagemax> itz the weekend 

[13:58] <obeychuy89> just wait yo 

[13:58] <aes0411> That's why you install patches before the stream. Just being honest 
[13:58] <exzander> you're going to get an error message soon i am sure. 

[13:58] <kekon3> https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist/status/929827193772851200

[13:59] <kushiyakitori> @Dukesdearfreja its done 

[13:59] <goldencolts> NotLikeThis ???? 

[13:59] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb Still though. If he was planning on playing COD today, he should have 
checked for patches this morning; not during pre-stream 
[13:59] <kekon3> @Dukesdearfreja it was just 3 stages 
[13:59] <pl4guet4stic> ??? 

[13:59] <convertedclone> Sonic Forces is over. Episode Shadow was 3 2minute stages 
[13:59] <korewasugoi> blows shit out of proportions 

[13:59] <dominonova> They are reactivating the HQ as we speak thats probably whats wrong 
[13:59] <pkradiance> @dukesdearfreja he finished and deleted it 
[13:59] <dukesdearfreja> @kushiyakitori wow that was fast 
[13:59] <dukesdearfreja> Damnnn lmao 

[13:59] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, If he checked right before he started playing a game and there was no 
update, then how is that his fault? 

[13:59] <connorxcrash> @DarksydePhil Servers are down right no Phil! 

[13:59] <pedropatriciol991> the game is not having a good launch, worse release for a CoD game ever. 

[13:59] <bethefueg> Did dsp enjoy sonic? 

[13:59] <korewasugoi> it was trash 

[13:59] <tigerflamessssss> PowerUpL YouDontSay PowerUpR 

[13:59] <encelor> sonic forces is garbage 

[14:00] <connorxcrash> Yes, for story, but not Gameplay! 

[14:00] <pkradiance> CoD The Big Chicken Dinner 
[14:00] <encelor> if it took phil 4 h to finish 
[14:00] <psvfan94> Should be a twerk emote 
[14:00] <convertedclone> Sonic Forces: 4 hours of "fun" 

[14:00] <encelor> the game is like 2-3 h long 

[14:00] <darthradovanviking> it was entertaining to watch though. 

[14:00] <bethefueg> I know lol but dsp said he liked it at first 

[14:00] <pl4guet4stic> why are all the officers either black dudes or women ??? 



[14:00] <depleet420> yo dsp, you gonna get rekt son 
[14:00] <korewasugoi> 40$ for 4 hours of garbage 

[14:00] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb If the update came out during pre-stream or shortly beforehand, you have a 
point. Based on what he said, patches have come out in the last few days and he didn’t bother updating before the 
pre-stream 

[14:00] <psvfan94> @pl4guet4stic because political correctness 
[14:00] <sofiarayne> feminists 
[14:01] <catmasterace> hello 

[14:01] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, Are you not reading what I'm saying? He checked if there wa an update 
before he even started playing dude...Christ. 

[14:01] <encelor> i hope kirn will nuke sega tsosGame that is just cash in on fans 

[14:01] <pl4guet4stic> god fucking dammit, so basically instead of being a historically accurate ww2 game it's a 
"things that didn’t happen" game LUL 

[14:01] <pkradiance> Sonic Forces feels like Sonic Dash but in 3D perspective with a story

[14:03] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, " If the update came out during pre-stream or shortly beforehand, you have 
a point. Based on what he said, patches have come out in the last few days and he didn’t bother updating before 
the pre-stream." How about you get a clue, I already told you he did check before he started. 

[14:03] <darthradovanviking> he downloaded the batch before the stream 

[14:04] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, You acnkowledged what I said, then continued to say he didn’t 
bother...you’re really not that bright. 

[14:04] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb Lol did I trigger you this much? Chill out

[14:05] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb You're the one who is using cheap insults. You need to think about what is 
important in your life. Getting this triggered by someone who brings up a different scenario is not that important. 
I said that if he checked for patches this morning, then it's fine. 

[14:05] <convertedclone> you think 

[14:05] <connorxcrash> Doesn't anyone Remember Phil seeing the PlayRoom and PlayRoom VR?!! I'm 
surprised Phil doesn't remember! 

[14:06] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil you need to unlock and Equip BAR gun very good gun to use allround 
[14:06] <ml55 lngn0> Better check again to make sure he's dead. 

[14:06] <somaiscariot> @DarksydePhil Are you going to put up a Christmas tree this year? 

[14:06] <goldencolts> hes using the BAR now

[14:06] <encelor> LUL 

[14:06] <pl4guet4stic> @encelor It was good of him to double check so he didn’t have to live without legs. 

[14:07] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, Straw manning doesn't help your case bub. A different scenario doesn't 

mean anything when you continued to say he didn’t bother checking. I love how you're ignoring your own words. 

[14:07] <211trill> saying bub in 2017 LUL 

[14:07] <211 trill> is that wolverine on that account LUL

[14:08] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411,1 can say "Well if it wasn't available, then you have a point." But if I 
quickly follow that up with "But he didn’t bother checking beforehand", then that completely makes your initial 
point null and void. 

[14:08] <encelor> Press F for Sanic forces

[14:09] <thesupervillain543> F 

[14:09] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb I said that if a patch came out during the pre-stream or shortly afterwards, 
then I understand why he checked for patches during the pre-stream. Otherwise, he should have checked it this 
morning because he was planning on playing COD today. I brought up both scenarios and I'll support whichever 
one actually happened. If you have an issue with what I said because I brought up a different scenario, then there 
is no helping you

[14:12] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb You need some help if you can’t accept others' opinions. If he said the 
opposite of what I claim, then why even argue my point? Just ignore it and move along. No need to get 
hyperventilated about a statement that is supposedly "wrong".

[14:52] <bass619> uh what why did he get banned 

[14:52] <darthradovanviking> no i will just time you out for now @madibased because that dind't make any 
sense to me 

[14:52] <chairmancaleb> @encelor. That's the first step towards communism/socialism right there. Love how we 
step over people's freedom to do what they wish w/ their own product. 

[14:52] <kinggoken> dsp has excellent aim 

[14:52] <bass619> @DarthRadovanViking he was talking about a russian girl that fingiered herself on stream for 
donations 

[14:52] <theycallmejimbob> fire in the hole SwiftRage 
[14:52] <goldencolts> the bar seems pretty damn solid in this one 

[14:52] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb it might get banned because it will be concidered as gambling 

[14:52] <goldencolts> it was slow as hell in other CoDs 

[14:52] <pl4guet4stic> dsp actually kicking ass NotLikeThis 

[14:52] <thatbritishlad_> @kinggoken bugged thumb mechanics lol 

[14:52] <darthradovanviking> why @bass619 

[14:53] <iconicmasterl> The scorestreak suck in this game 

[14:53] <pkradiance> why the ban? What the guy do? 

[14:53] <kinggoken> lol 



[14:53] <theycallmejimbob> welp NotLikeThis 

[14:53] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb and minors gambling is illegal 

[14:53] <darthradovanviking> don't worry about it @pkradiance 

[14:53] <chairmancaleb> @encelor. It’s not though. A perfect example is pokemon cards and the like that little 
kids buy. You don't know what you get in the product because it's random. Gambling is taking a risk for 
something or nothing. 

[14:53] <temoblanks> I saw in a PBS documentary how they called airstrikes to kill one man in WWII 
[14:54] <bass619> @DarthRadovanViking uhm idk, maybe to point out how twitch is siding with titty streamers 
she got a 24 hour ban 

[14:54] <jefoliveira90> You got stabbed. Should've moved 

[14:54] <kinggoken> he shot the guy like ten times before he got stabbed lmao 

[14:54] <quantumquinn> Phil you're 2the bestestl! 

[14:54] <secretbossfight> Wow I thought I was hearing Axel F from this game for a minute 
[14:54] <breaktheglass> ESRB said its not gambling because you get something in return 
[14:54] <goldencolts> OSfirog 
[14:54] <jefoliveira90> He missed a bunch tho 

[14:54] <thatbritishlad_> If Phil bought this physically, I think he’d take a sledgehammer to the disc.

[14:58] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, Physical? I thought the issue was gambling. Physical or digital doesn’t 



matter in the case of gambling. And "rigging" is nothing but conjecture. If that ever came to light, we’d 
collectively shun them for sure.

[14:59] <pl4guet4stic> @encelor to be fair that's different than what Kam was saying. Warcrimes against enemy 
and own. Still skeptical of his allegation though. 

[14:59] <bethefueg> Lol we get it. The world is an awful place. Oh look a gameplay stream lol leta€™s watch 
[14:59] <ninthgrove> Hello phillip 
[14:59] <theycallmejimbob> dspFun 

[14:59] <aes0411> There is a rumor that a Switch version is being made for the Switch and will arrive in the 
Fall/Winter of 2018 

[14:59] <kinggoken> of this game? @aes0411 

[15:00] <arrowhead371> probably going to be a cashgrab port 

[15:00] <thatbritishlad_> @aes0411 A switch emulator on the switch? xD 

[15:00] <youngkam513> The harlem hell fighters were die in battlefield 1 because of how great they were but 
are little known and were not allowed to fly the us flag 
[15:00] <tomahawkings> A switch version for the switch? Jeez 
[15:00] <hero2zerooo> what xD 

[15:00] <pl4guet4stic> Phil you totally should've picked up that PPSH, it's an ass kicker.

[15:00] <dantemustdiee> TERRIBLE GAMEPLAY *shoots ally* LUL 

[15:01] <kinggoken> lol 

[15:01] <darthradovanviking> yeah stupid ally 

[15:01] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb problem is just like gambling with digital rng stuff it get rigged hard when 
you buy pokemon card you get pokemon cards regardle with rng loot boxes the case is you want a character or 
weapon you end up with a 10H exp boost its way more random than pokemon cards wich in the end you still get 
pokemon cards 

[15:01] <secretbossfight> It's almost like cone grenades were designed to prevent people from hiding in corners 
like that 

[15:01] <encelor> Wall of text WutFace 

[15:01] <breaktheglass> standard game prices can only be a certain max price so I guess that is the cause of this 
loot box system 

[15:01] <jefoliveira90> Gotta hit them first too 

[15:01] <ornightz> But Phil they Promised Boots OTG gameplay you getting everything worth it's Buck LUL

enemies bro LUL 



[15:02] <pl4guet4stic> @Ornightz that was the first lie, as someone has already pointed out, you don't even see 
your own legs, so where’s the boots on ground I ASK??? 

[15:02] <thatbritishlad_> lol "yawn" 

[15:02] <aes0411> Ohh oops. Let me rephrase my point.I heard there is a rumor that a Switch version of 

FighterZ is scheduled to release in the Fall/Winter of 2018

[15:04] <pl4guet4stic> @tourwithme yeah and bundle it up with some new futuristic shit COD 
[15:04] <waifudestroyermatt> would activision want free money hmm 
[15:04] <encelor> who would not want free money 
[15:04] <encelor> LUL 

[15:04] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, You don’t need to regurgitate what you said, I got that. But I don’t agree. 

Gambling has always been taking risks for a possibility of nothing for what you invested. That’s not the same as 

"Oh, I hope I get this really cool skin!" The Pokemon carsd is a very fair example because it operates in the same 

way. Companies place random cards in the little packets, and you hope you get that really cool holographic 

Charizard. "Rigging", as I said, is conjecture. So unless you have proof

[15:06] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb Why did you have an issue with my point about checking for patches. I 

just wanted to bring it up to the table 

[15:06] <iconicmasterl> You got to play free for all 

[15:06] <connorxcrash> See! 

[15:06] <tourwithme> and I'm level 35

[15:06] <brotherplaya> i just watched the clip phil and you were wide left on that guy and hit him at most once 
[15:06] <obltv> he teleporting in ghosts was way worse 

[15:06] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, Because you slandered Phil by saying he didn't bother checking for updates 
when I initially said that in the very beginning...? 

[15:06] <goldencolts> cheer 100 

[15:06] <pray4rock> Sadly bullets don't curve like the movie Wanted

[15:06] <quantumquinn> the Nazis were known to have teleportation technology 

[15:07] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb I'm not going to get into an argument with a child. I think that I've proven 
my point 

[15:07] <thatindieglo> Scoped is better 

[15:07] <darthradovanviking> no antigravity technology @QuantumQuinn 
[15:07] <junky97> The BAR just got nerfed yesterday 
[15:07] <encelor> Full metal jacket movie 

[15:07] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, Then why did you even tag me..? FailFish 
[15:07] <encelor> my fave movie 

[15:07] <cookiemonster414> @darksydephil u should increase aim sensitivity. 

[15:07] <tomahawkings> This game is fubar. At least the mp 

[15:07] <tourwithme> SHG says its secretly Nazi Occult ritual that everyone is telporting around 



[15:07] <tourwithme> lol 

[15:07] <breaktheglass> snipers also got nerfed 

[15:07] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb To make a point, which I did 

[15:07] <junky97> This game is legit the best COD in a long time 

[15:07] <connorxcrash> Finally! 

[15:08] <chairmancaleb> @aes0411, If that makes you feel better I suppose...? Lol 

[15:08] <darthradovanviking> godamnit are youou at it again @aes0411 and @ChairmanCaleb ? 

[15:08] <lord_edmund_blackadder> @Junky97 Says a lot about the state of CoD 
[15:08] <madibased> Im fireeee now 
[15:08] <tourwithme> I disagree with that 

[15:08] <chairmancaleb> @darthradovanviking, Blame Aes, he's the one who tagged me. 

[15:08] <tourwithme> Its okay at best 

[15:08] <encelor> @DarthRadovanViking chairman loves to argue xD 
[15:08] <madibased> im sorry mods i wanted the opinion of the viewers :/ 

[15:08] <chairmancaleb> @darthradovanviking, I was just trying to have a disucssion w/ another user, and once 
again, he had to have an issue w/ that. 

[15:08] <junky97> @Lord_Edmund_Blackadder I Mean sure, the last couple of COD's were complete ass but 

this is by far the best COD that there has been since MW2 

[15:09] <theycallmejimbob> dspSurpriseddsp madibased 

[15:09] <tourwithme> Compared to WaW from 2008 this game is bad 

[15:09] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb I made my point. I’m done 

[15:09] <darthradovanviking> well ok stop tagging eachouter, and try to ignore one another or argue on PM 

@ChairmanCaleb and @aes0411 

[15:09] <connorxcrash> They...call...him. 

[15:09] <nightbot> ConnorXcrash -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks, [warning] 

[15:09] <madibased> I just think its dumb phil puts time and efforts into his pre streams and theres chicks out 
there getting like 5K viewers for nothing 

[15:09] <goldencolts> using the Gewehr 43 in world at war was so enjoyable Kreygasm 

[15:09] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, I thought we were having a civil discussion for the most part, I wasn't really 
arguing w/ you? We were priving two different perspectives with each other. I liekd it. 

[15:09] <connorxcrash> They call him... 

[15:09] <goldencolts> it was like paintballing or something the way you had to tap out shots 
[15:09] <breaktheglass> botg did not mean to have players unable to jump to the side or slide, they just gave the 
players old basic movements 
[15:09] <connorxcrash> (wait for it) 

[15:10] <connorxcrash> (wait for it!!) 

[15:10] <pl4guet4stic> @madibased idk man I betcha Phil would get a shit ton of more viewers if he got his 
titties out 

[15:10] <connorxcrash> (wait...) 

[15:10] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb yeah we had but it felt like a arguement since i never expressed my opinion 

about the england case 

[15:10] <aes0411> @encelor Exactly 

[15:10] <encelor> i just tried to explain 

[15:10] <madibased> @PL4GUET4STIC dont they ban males for going shirtless or is that a myth 
[15:10] <connorxcrash> (wait for it.... 

[15:10] <encelor> what the england case was 

[15:10] <tourwithme> These fucks are going to DLC actual war events. DLC for Pacific Warfare against 
Japanese. DLC for Soviet Russians 
[15:10] <connorxcrash> DSPDiesNaked!!! 

[15:11] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, I never asked for your opinion? You were saying it was gambling, and I was 
proviing examples on how it's not. 

[15:11] <junky97> Guy didn’t spawn there. 





[15:11] <quantumquinn> stop fighting over Phil we all know I'm his favorite viewer 
[15:11] <junky97> Legit saw him running into you 
[15:11] <dantemustdiee> HAHAHAHahaha 

[15:11] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb i said england might put ban since it could be considered as gambling and 
they are reviewing the case 

[15:11] <connorxcrash> Sorry! I'm getting carried away by Phil's humor of WW2! 

[15:11] <encelor> i never said its gambling and it should go 
[15:11] <sazzypazz> the cod father 

[15:11] <madibased> its not gamlbing unless you walk into a casino

[15:12] <encelor> i only tried to explain why england might ban lootboxes @ChairmanCaleb sorry if there was a 
misscommunication 

[15:13] <youngkam513> The devs dont care 

[15:13] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, "problem is just like gambling with digital rng stuff it get rigged hard" You 
made a correlation though and decided to rely on conjecture. No one is signing that petition because of potential 
rigging in the first place, that's not why the government is reviewing it. 

[15:13] <trihard41iife> I used to follow sodapoppin.. he has 50k watchers at a complete sell out stream., what the 
fuxk 

[15:13] <trihard41iife> disgusting 

[15:13] <divanerasmus> @DarksydePhil you should camp please that is the best option man 
[15:13] <timboslicegb> why do you keep playing 
[15:13] <timboslicegb> lets play matio 

[15:13] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb yeah because they might ban it on those points 

[15:14] <aes0411> @ChairmanCaleb I won’t get into an argument, but I was trying to raise the possibility about 
patches. If he said that he checked for patches in the morning and nothing was there, then I stand corrected 
[15:14] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, I personally don't think it'll go anywhere. 

[15:14] <pl4guet4stic> @TriHard4Liife How about Ice Poseidon? 

[15:14] <slayer> it's amazing how fast they die from Phil shooting their legs all the time 
[15:14] <encelor> @ChairmanCaleb i don’t know we’ll see in the future :D 
[15:15] <tomahawkings> I used to be a nazi. Then i took a bullet to the knee 

[15:15] <chairmancaleb> @encelor, *Sigh* if it does, then that's bad. But We won't get into opinions on that, 

that'll casue a whole other bag of worms :p

[15:45] <samrlaseter> @haikugay it's a piece of sh*t and the devs did a terrible job 
[15:45] <pl4guet4stic> @haikugay seems to really dislike the MP, not sure about SP 
[15:45] <musclesforbones> that was some quality mic scratching LUL 
[15:45] <encelor> wolfenstein

[15:46] <goldencolts> doodlecheerlOO 

[15:46] <chairmancaleb> I’d love some sort of World at War throwback by Treyarch, but it's too little too late. 
[15:46] <timboslicegb> mrasportd not true 

[15:46] <samrlaseter> complete bullshit! why does Phil even give the devs the free advertising by playing this 
POS 

[15:46] <dominonova> this game is riddled with head glitches 

[15:47] <toiletanesthesia> World at War 2 would’ve been so much better than this. 

[15:47] <timboslicegb> bo3 online was garbage at launch like this 
[15:47] <godparticle> WaW shits all over this game 

[15:47] <goldencolts> too late from a marketing perspective for world at war 2 

[15:47] <aloofone> should of played the objectives 

[15:47] <encelor> WaW is still bae 

[15:48] <encelor> killing them weeb japs never gets old

[15:48] <waifudestroyermatt> FAKE NEWS 

[15:48] <timboslicegb> have you guys played this game or go off what Phil said and plays . black ops 3 was like

[15:48] <toiletanesthesia> Mp40 jug spam lol 
[15:48] <toiletanesthesia> good times 

[15:48] <goldencolts> i liked when you would play that one airfield map in world at war and they would say 
"TOJO in the DOJO" 

[15:48] <godparticle> I just run around with a shovel to annoy people in this dumb game lol 

[15:48] <connorxcrash> idk 

[15:48] <cookiemonster414> switch guns phil. 

[15:48] <breaktheglass> @timboslicegb b03 still never fixed a lot of bugs to this day like scope variants 
[15:49] <ricol34> why do you like annoying people @godparticle 
[15:49] <samrlaseter> that guy definitely didn’t hit phil, wtf 
[15:49] <oooooar> lol 

[15:49] <samrlaseter> those bullets were nowhere close to him! 

[15:49] <coreypending> You got baited. That wasna€™t a connection issue hahah 
[15:49] <godparticle> Because I’m an awful person 



[15:49] <timboslicegb> black ops 3 had server issues for 2 weeks post launch 

[15:49] <zocdeta> yes, phil is an immortal god, and therefore could not possibly be hit by the enemy team 
[15:49] <dr_kyokushin> doctorKARATE 

[15:49] <samrlaseter> oh wow and they shot phil through a solid oak wall? yeah right 

[15:49] <encelor> fmj bullets 

[15:49] <zocdeta> these aren't airsoft guns my dude 

[15:49] <connorxcrash> Basically in this game, you have to be seick of what will actually happen, than what the 
game says! 

[15:50] <oooooar> phil never really did excel in cod tbf 
[15:50] <ricol34> nope 

[15:50] <timboslicegb> that makes Bo sense connor 

[15:50] <darthradovanviking> @ZocDeta I am glad we have you here einstein 

[15:50] <somethingyer2> this game is fun 

[15:50] <zocdeta> thanks for the appreciation my friend

[15:50] <encelor> sllverWut 

[15:50] <pl4guet4stic> damn Phil 

[15:50] <connorxcrash> @timboslicegb You mean no sense. 

[15:50] <jefoliveira90> Phil is pissed! 

[15:50] <pl4guet4stic> nice one TriHard 

[15:51] <breaktheglass> Assassin’s Creed games stopped the one year stuff because of bugs and wanted a more 
polished game 

[15:51] <timboslicegb> I sold iw after two days of launch I have had more fun with this game then that trash 
[15:51] <jjman93> Oh man its been so long since ive watched DSP Kreygasm 
[15:51] <encelor> lergit 

[15:51] <pl4guet4stic> oh wow, that's a cool detail, body just exploded into blood matter as the tank went over 
your corpse 

[15:51] <chairmancaleb> @timboslicegb, Infinity Ward hasn't been the same since the end of the Modern 
Warfare franchise. 

[15:52] <jefoliveira90> Phil is using his strategic skills 
[15:52] <encelor> build them defenses walls tsosRuse 

[15:52] <lord_edmund_blackadder> "Super early" > tank is 30 meters away Kappa 
[15:52] <timboslicegb> AC origins change the game play too much for my liking 
[15:52] <connorxcrash> How long until we are done with this game 

[15:52] <toiletanesthesia> It'll be interesting to see what infinity ward does next after ghost and iw 
[15:52] <aloofone> stream is skipping frames 

[15:52] <pl4guet4stic> I can't imagine a single person who actually forgot what the fucking object was, WHY is 
this commander screaming about every single tiny ass event that goes on. 

[15:53] <toiletanesthesia> they really have to step their game up 
[15:53] <encelor> lh 8min 
[15:53] <drilbit777> Cod Vietnam 

[15:53] <breaktheglass> Well COD just needs a skip a year polish up a nice non bubby game

[15:53] <somethingyer2> you can turn the announcer off @PL4GUET4STIC 
[15:53] <encelor> DooD ! 

[15:53] <timboslicegb> Rumor is that infinity ward is working on mw4 
[15:53] <jefoliveira90> it was on neutral 



[15:53] <samrlaseter> wow, the nazis won 

[15:53] <encelor> sllverWut i killed the gai and the tank sllverWut 

[15:53] <godparticle> It’s called momentum 

[15:53] <connorxcrash> @timboslicegb Hopefully it's true 

[15:53] <samrlaseter> that's so p******** up g*d d*mn it Phil’s teammates were NO help 

[15:53] <enzadeninosbull> @PL4GUET4STIC they add announcements like that for artificial immersion 

[15:53] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Ehm, enemies behind the tank move it forward too 

[15:53] <pl4guet4stic> @Somethingyer2 besides the point, it's almost insulting how they assume the players 

have the attention span of a goldfish 

[15:54] <muggerson> LUL thir was another behind the tank smartass 
[15:54] <enzadeninosbull> its a substitute for actual captivating gameplay

guys away"

[15:55] <thewhitejamal> So phil is normal then 

[15:55] <samrlaseter> @timboslicegb he's got to play what the fans want, for some reason we want this r*tarded 
game and not a good game like mario 

[15:55] <lord_edmund_blackadder> LOL now the tank shoots 

[15:55] <lord_edmund_blackadder> dear god 

[15:55] <connorxcrash> @SamRLaseter DarksydeNazis

[15:56] <samrlaseter> wow, why the f*ck would the devs think it's a good idea to make the gun move from 
where you aim 

[15:56] <leonaras> " right down my sights "

[15:57] <dinq_sas_sirence> Sledgehammer makes only campaign 

[15:57] <breaktheglass> if they would skip cod for just one freaking year they could polish and would build up 
more hype 

[15:57] <jefoliveira90> Shhh. Game logic 

[15:57] <waifudestroyermatt> @breaktheglass but they'd get less money 

[15:57] <jefoliveira90> Tanks need escorts

[15:59] <sethl89> LUL 

[15:59] <breaktheglass> @WaifuDestroyerMatt they have many teams some could work on a new IP. People are 
tired of the bugs. 

[15:59] <samrlaseter> i didn’t see the graphics glitching 

[15:59] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Glitched graphics mechanics 

[15:59] <jefoliveira90> i din’t saw anything 

[15:59] <samrlaseter> but I wasn’t watching very closely 

[15:59] <oooooar> those screams of agony jesus 

[15:59] <encelor> he missed a whole clip... 

[15:59] <waifudestroyermatt> @breaktheglass they would do it if it wasn’t a massive success every year. People 

would have to stop buying it 

[15:59] <samrlaseter> phil has a real eye for detail 

[15:59] <thewhitejamal> Is it the graphics or the player that is glitching 

[15:59] <muggerson> stopping yearly releases does nothing, IWard spent 3 years on IW and look at it, the extra 
years of polish don’t solve the blind hate people will have 

[15:59] <chairmancaleb> @breaktheglass, Activision won’t allow that, that's why they hired another team. This 
way, each team has about two years to make their game, lol. Not that it makes much difference. 

[15:59] <encelor> sllverXl sllverX2 sllverX3 how do you miss 30 bullets... 

[15:59] <samrlaseter> @thewhitejamal are you IMPLYING that Phil isn’t telling the truth about what's 
happening in the game? 

[16:00] <breaktheglass> @WaifuDestroyerMatt well yeah you have me there 
[16:00] <zocdeta> generally people become infinitely less helpful upon death 
[16:00] <samrlaseter> they're jerking themselves off 

[16:00] <kinggoken> COD needs to do the same thing Ubisoft did with Asscreed 
[16:00] <lord_edmund_blackadder> What? Blunderheads? FreakinStinkin 
[16:00] <samrlaseter> why did phil just shoot his own tank 
[16:00] <haikugay> @ZocDeta my main man jesus didn’t 
[16:00] <enzadeninosbull> make a we wuz version? 

[16:00] <zocdeta> true true 

[16:00] <encelor> @SamRLaseter stress testing it for the tank company

[16:01] <divanerasmus> Fuck This Game 

[16:01] <divanerasmus> FTG 

[16:01] <timboslicegb> each company gets 3 years to make their cod game taking a year off does nothijf 
[16:01] <samrlaseter> Heil Phil! 



[16:01] <wetw0rk> For the Fatherland! 

[16:01] <oooooar> ta nk is on the mOOve

[16:01] <divanerasmus> sumBlind sumPotato sumBlind sumPotato sumBlind sumPotato 
[16:01] <thatanonybear> @timboslicegb it'd give that company 6 years LUL 

[16:01] <chairmancaleb> @timboslicegb, Yup, it's not like there's any innovation that goes into that time frame 
either. 

[16:01] <enzadeninosbull> the studios are just garbage or careless 

[16:01] <kinggoken> They shouldn’t release a cod game next year. They should skip 2018. In 2019 release the 
new COD game. Sales will go through the roof. 

[16:01] <samrlaseter> WOW 

[16:01] <thewhitejamal> You gotta watch out for those sandbags 

[16:02] <breaktheglass> @ChairmanCaleb the problem is the deadline. They just release whatever even if its 

buggy. I believe this year people could not even play the game for hours 

[16:02] <muggerson> @timboslicegb 100% agree, taking a year off does not solve the issue 

[16:02] <encelor> sllverBaby 

[16:02] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Yay 

[16:02] <samrlaseter> Phil! awesome! 

[16:02] <wetw0rk> The Fuhrer is pleased with your efforts. 

[16:02] <omobzii> Why does my cod look like Xbox 360 
[16:02] <dooley258> That was a minute overtime 

[16:02] <chairmancaleb> @breaktheglass, Why do you think I don’t buy games at launch anymore LUL 

[16:02] <dominonova> ric flair 

[16:02] <pl4guet4stic> off to Auschwitz you go! 

[16:02] <encelor> for ze Fuhrer 

[16:02] <chairmancaleb> @breaktheglass, I agree though. 

[16:02] <enzadeninosbull> the games have about 6 months of life before it gets stale, then they add more maps 
and its still boring for the last 6 

[16:03] <muggerson> @Kinggoken the next 2 CoD games are already in production 3 studios rotate this genre in 
development for 3 years each, its impossible to take a year off with the franchise and that is NOT the problem 
[16:03] <samrlaseter> @ChairmanCaleb yeah, I actually don’t even buy any games at all nowadays. Watching all 
of Phil’s playthroughs proves to me how terrible the games are made these days 
[16:03] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Rank up! Master Sergeant Super Person To The Max!

[16:36] <hunterasahi> did it? 

[16:36] <kinggoken> they should try to continue that story 

[16:36] <breaktheglass> soo there is a new overwatch character coming I assume DSP will be playing 

[16:36] <goldencolts> doodlecheerlOO doodlecheerlOO doodlecheer25 

[16:37] <nlck_hearse> would you want to spend 2 years on a game about evil nazis? 

[16:37] <sirnoblex> Ghosts was probably one of the worst CODs though. 

[16:37] <kinggoken> true lol 

[16:37] <somethingyer2> infinite warfare is the worst 

[16:37] <zaherking> ghosts had a pretty good story 

[16:37] <rawmikey> Howa€™s the snipping in this? Is quick scope back? 

[16:37] <brahski20> @SirNobleX Did Fill like ghosts? 

[16:37] <hunterasahi> imo cod3 had the best campaign 
[16:37] <thatanonybear> @N1CK_HEARSE absolutely 
[16:37] <thewhitejamal> if he didn’t die, why did you stop shooting 
[16:37] <sirnoblex> @Brahski20 Don’t think so. 

[16:37] <darthradovanviking> i would only use two years on the good nazis 

[16:38] <pl4guet4stic> @breaktheglass oh right, that uninspired shit-stain that's basically Sombra and Symmetra 
combined into one. 

[16:38] <zaherking> bo3 has the worst campain

[16:43] <brahski20> I think fill's controllers are messed up. He can't jump in marior odyssy and he can’t aim in 
cod 

[16:43] <brahski20> He should get analog extenders for more precision 
[16:43] <6th_moral> or use a mouse 
[16:43] <thewhitejamal> or git gud 

[16:43] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Phil just doesn’t just use the BAR he is the BAR 5Y-’ 

[16:43] <godparticle> I don't see how people enjoy playing these games for months/years. I can only take a week 
at most 

[16:43] <brahski20> @6th_Moral Imagine fill using a mouse 

[16:43] <basedotto> Or get better 

[16:43] <hunterasahi> these controller gimmiks 

[16:44] <brahski20> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz We don't set the bar we are duh bar 

[16:44] <nlck_hearse> these stupid idiots don’t even see phil sneaking up on em

[16:45] <hunterasahi> bouncing betty was so good in bo2 

[16:45] <godparticle> I'm just hoping battlefront isn’t as much of a letdown as this game. Not expecting much, 
though 

[16:45] <hunterasahi> op af 

[16:45] <encelor> in WaW bouncing booty was best 
[16:45] <hunterasahi> i never played waw 
[16:45] <sprank_n> uuuhhhhh... 

[16:46] <kinggoken> I actually enjoyed WaW more than this 

[16:46] <brahski20> Fill you should try a gaming monjitor man. HOnestly you are at least 20 frames behind 



everyone you are playing against because of your refresh rate 
[16:46] <hunterasahi> i heard it was good 
[16:46] <encelor> i loved the maps in WaW 

[16:46] <wholetruthbruce> This doesn't feel like a WW2 battle at all 
[16:46] <neospartanhesperos9> why 

[16:46] <godparticle> WaW was less run around like chickens with heads off...slightly 
[16:46] <hunterasahi> the maps in cod in the new games seem very small

[16:52] <godparticle> Or maybe he was there the whole time 
[16:52] <cookiemonster414> MingLee 

[16:52] <zocdeta> getting killed in multiplayer is a failure of the game designer 
[16:53] <sprank_n> lol i dont think that was sledgehammers fault tbh

[16:58] <kinggoken> cool:) 

[16:58] <kinggoken> i hope the game doesn’t suck 

[16:58] <convertedclone> still the BAR huh? Why not try a shotgun? 

[16:58] <encelor> battlefield 2? 

[16:58] <encelor> you mean starwars? 

[16:58] <kinggoken> Battlefront 2 
[16:58] <encelor> ah 

[16:58] <kinggoken> Dsp uses the bar because he just doesn't set the bar. He IS the bar. :D 

[16:58] <convertedclone> or an smg 

[16:58] <thewhitejamal> dude, you just got 360 no scoped 

[16:59] <butter_my_bread> Even after the nerf the BAR is still probably the best gun in the game so why not 

[16:59] <darthradovanviking> His norwegian name would prbobably be Fillip BurnAjs

[16:59] <brahski20> Get filled up 

[16:59] <oooooar> u just dont have the same reflexes you used to man 
[16:59] <jefoliveira90> Playing alright now 

[17:00] <pelhamplays> I kind of wish Phil would let the death cams play out to see if he’s truly talking shit or 
not. Plus, maybe he could learn strategy from them. 

[17:00] <brahski20> I like when fill looks downt he sites and just sprays back and forth 

[17:00] <neospartanhesperos9> phil playing smart

[17:00] <thatanonybear> @PelhamPlays agreed, he has a few times, but he mostly skips them to get into the 
action 

[17:00] <thewhitejamal> sometimes you have to actually move around the map 
[17:00] <nunya_bizness> L try playing the objective 

[17:00] <convertedclone> you think he would let the killcams play "to see if he's truly talking shit"? That would 
never happen 

[17:00] <pray4rock> HSWP 

[17:00] <iconicmasterl> Another fucking sniper get play of the game FailFish

[17:03] <brahski20> @DarthRadovanViking Huh? 

[17:03] <pelhamplays> Is it just me, or does Phil even have fun playing games anymore? He constantly plays 



these games which he claims he hates and keeps complaining about them.
