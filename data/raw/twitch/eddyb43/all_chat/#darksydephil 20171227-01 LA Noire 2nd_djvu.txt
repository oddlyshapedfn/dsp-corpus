[11:50] <concretecasket> woop woop 

[11:50] <bethelewd> jim phone fifa im sure they will listen to you 

[11:50] <leonaras> @darksydephil Phil, genuine question. Do you think you are rushing things with your new 
partner a bit much? You have been together for like 5 months and met irl about 4 times. Isn't it a bit early to be 
bandying around terms like love and soulmates? Living with someone is a whole lot different than having a long 
weekend with them, as you probably know by experience with Leanna. Just dont want to see you rush into 
things! Stay positive! 

[11:50] <fineandspacedandy> Oh shit 

[11:50] <industrialspaceman> Squidl Squid2 Squid3 Squid4 

[11:50] <redhead666x> He streams here for hours, and people won't even tip him 20 bucks per hour? That's

[11:51] <theycallmejimbob> SeemsGood 

[11:51] <khaosrayne> @Glorytobeh did he ever say if it ended up being legit? 

[11:51] <lunar_rabs> hi cherry 

[11:51] <redhead666x> @Glorytobeh In the world of adults, you need a steady income. 

[11:51] <redhead666x> Stop being so selfish guys.

[11:54] <waifudestroyermatt> Just got here, what did I miss 
[11:54] <buzzfizz32> !paytreon 

[11:54] <stevegatsby> will the worst games countdown be uploaded to kogaming ? 

[11:54] <mrben72> why is he snorting like that all the time ? that's disturbing 

[11:54] <khaosrayne> @Redhead666x well I’d suggest don’t request others to do things that you yourself can’t or 
wont do., your situation and others are not the same obviously 
[11:54] <darkvikingl59> @MrBen72 its his sickness 
[11:54] <encephalolz> Over 9000 bucks. WutFace 



[11:54] <sherrie92> @MrBen72 he is congested

[11:55] <fleaster80> Does Phil not set aside money throughout the year to pay taxes? 

[11:55] <bethelewd> jim no they scored first then i secored 2 in the second half then they scored near the end lol 

[11:55] <waifudestroyermatt> [patreon 

[11:55] <fineandspacedandy> Is darthviking DRV? 

[11:56] <redhead666x> @khaosrayne Hey I'm just giving Phil a great idea to help him with his financial 
situation. 

[11:56] <banlsh> @Fleaster80 pretty sure most adults do that 

[11:56] <encephalolz> It's back taxes. Regualtions that his current tax attorney missed when he moved from 
Connecticutt to Washington. @Fleaster80 

[11:56] <khaosrayne> @Redhead666x that's not a great idea., that would probably hurt him more than anything 
[11:56] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm the team goes all attacking BeTheLewd near the end should change your 
tactics to park the bus 

[11:56] <fleaster80> @encephalolz but he's also mentioned this year's tax bill... 

[11:56] <bethelewd> darkvinking is another viking nothing to do with sir mod viking 
[11:56] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> mort LUL

[11:57] <theycallmehanzo> Will you sue your tax attorney 

[11:57] <bethelewd> jim i dont even change the tactics in my games :D 

[11:57] <redhead666x> @khaosrayne It works well for a scrub like LTG, it would be a real hit for Phil. 

[11:57] <suckasurprise> The Mort saga

[11:58] <khaosrayne> @Lightkunl988 did he confirm that? 

[11:58] <cherry_dood> People are tipping too much. Patreon is more important. 

[11:58] <redhead666x> Phil needs to start valuing his work and art more to be honest. 

[11:58] <theycallmejimbob> dspHmm BeTheLewd 

[11:58] <stinkinburrows> @khaosrayne he said so far it was, but there is stilla chance it could b chargedback 
[11:58] <44kpanda> RIP... the Patreon actually decreased 
[11:58] <khaosrayne> @Stinkinburrows ah ok. thanks!! 

[11:58] <banlsh> keep your head up 

[11:58] <lightkunl988> @khaosrayne I don’t know haven't heard a clear answer on that topic

[12:00] <suckasurprise> @I_Came_Here_To_Something As much as Phil hates the game, I think he has 
potential to get a lot of tips if he plays it 
[12:00] <hoboxl0> you got a donation phil 

[12:00] <fineandspacedandy> People like bad games.PUBG always brings in the most people 
[12:00] <encephalolz> Dan is pretty forward when he asks for money. Jebaited

[12:03] <leonaras> @DarksydePhil People are also going to want to tip you moreso than use patreon given that 
your bill situation is time sensitive. Patreon has quite a delay before you get the money like Bits do, and you 
have recently asked people to focus more on tips so you are ready for the backtaxes next month.

[12:06] <mrben72> omg snorting and now burbing? where am I 

[12:06] <encephalolz> Would've been awesome if Rockstar expanded the L.A. map a little in this remaster. Too 
much of Los Angeles was missing. 

[12:06] <bethelewd> pops yes cause you a THICC

[12:06] <myathebeez> Dino Crisis HD remix edition needs to come out. 

[12:06] <bethelewd> Kappa 

[12:06] <i_came_here_to_something> If Patreon money goes to him directly, why did he keep saying tips were 
the most important b/c those go to him immediately? Didn’t that maybe make people think Patreon DIDN’T go to 
him immediately? Genuine question. 

[12:06] <concretecasket> woop woop

[12:06] <i_came_here_to_something> If he clarified how Patreon worked maybe the $1K tip would've been a

[12:36] <fluffysuperfan> @darksydephil what do you think about dr disrespects wife starting to stream 
[12:36] <klyntje> Phil, you should give the information to an accountant. Tax Attorneys don’t do people's taxes. 
Tax attorneys are not accountants and are rarely involved in filing taxes with the IRS. Tax attorneys typically do 
not hold the expertise of an accountant when maximizing deductions and planning ahead for future tax years.

[14:57] <darkvikingl59> the thing is he got a lot of timeouts before 

[14:57] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Wrath got banned too?! BibleThump

[14:59] <sherrie92> @encephalolz i got perma banned when i first joined with this account didnt do anything 
wrong 

[14:59] <mikehuntthedestroyer> You've committed crimes against an unknown mod and his/her people. What 
say you in your defense? 

[14:59] <braintics> Is Phil getting rich from these streams? 

[14:59] <blue_blur64> Hey guys, that heavy is the rain song? Can someone remix it to "heavy is the snow" since 

it's snowing so much right now for me? brownFEELS 

[14:59] <darkvikingl59> beside its going to be a lot of money nope 

[14:59] <creepyspaghetti47> Bugged State Tax Mechanics 

[14:59] <theycallmejimbob> :D hey Creepy they're Phil's fan made remixes 

[14:59] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> If I ever get assassinated by a Norwegian hitman, I just wanted to say that I 
love you all. Every day is a Rusev day for me <3 

[15:00] <feignit> DSP believed out of state tax accountant to do his state taxes properly dspNothing 
[15:00] <mikehuntthedestroyer> When I am dead and have passed onto the next world, I want you to lower me 
from these gallows anda€| kiss my hairy buttocks! 

[15:00] <steveofhouse> bugged state tax mechanics, but like what? how much did his taxes go up since last year? 
[15:01] <blue_blur64> Not that taxes went up, is that they were done wrong basically 
[15:01] <pinkdam> trust in trump for phil's taxes to go down 
[15:01] <creepyspaghetti47> suhjimbob. 

[15:01] <blue_blur64> Although I don’t remember the details of what happened brownLUL 
[15:01] <travisvincent> TRUMP 

[15:02] <steveofhouse> so his accountant botched his taxes? is he facing a penalty? 

[15:02] <shega_ace> wasn’t it a tax attorney that screwed him over or something? 

[15:02] <channel33> ;_;

[15:03] <strugglesome> wot is this

[15:05] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Decapitatioooooooon 

[15:05] <travisvincent> Kirby's Epic Yarn was actually a really good game 

[15:05] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> if you're a fan since Epic Mickey then props to you BloodTrail 

[15:05] <feignit> the tax state rate seems to be at least 1.5% so DSP owes at least $15 per $1000 plus penalty for 

N years. 

[15:05] <blue_blur64> it's a very chill game

[15:06] <steveofhouse> i don't remember the first playthrough of dsp's i watched, but it was when he was filming 
his tv with a camera. 

[15:06] <factorbactorjr> @quaztang as long as that isnt the reason you stay, then it isnt a bad thing 

[15:06] <quaztang> but i watched his playthroughs afterwards 

[15:06] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Heyyy @Kekon3 wazzz up wherever you are

[15:07] <sherrie92> i dont watch Tihydp 

[15:07] <travisvincent> These songs will be on iTunes soon 

[15:07] <feignit> DSP is getting a great deal if he only has to pay 1.5% state income tax LUL 
[15:07] <sherrie92> i like this song 

[15:07] <steveofhouse> i remember when he went to blip.tv. then got kicked off of it.

[15:08] <opposable> john cuck rambo

[15:11] <horror_duck_l> I actually found @darksydephil through TIHYDP and ever since I've been watching 
Phils playthroughs and stuff 

[15:11] <darkvikingl59> @HungryMaggot nah this was hes break 

[15:11] <hungrymaggot> Dammit 

[15:11] <blue_blur64> we need a lurk emote

[15:11] <theycallmejimbob> a wrong emote or monkaS version of dspPepe 
[15:11] <hoboxlO> monkaS BlessRNG 

[15:11] <quaztang> People try to include Phil talking in those TIHYDP as if that is somehow a negative, but 

that's actually where I started to realize he was an interesting dude 

[15:11] <mikehuntthedestroyer> Oooh we need a "Wrong!" emote 

[15:12] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> BlessRNG 

[15:12] <hoboxlO> monkaS is a betterttv emote

[15:12] <feignit> MonkaS 

[15:12] <zipzo989> sodaEZ 

[15:12] <quaztang> Phil! I wanted to know how you name your YouTube videos.. The names always describe 
what's in the video, but I know you are recording them during multi-hour streams. How do you remember what 
each video is about? Do you make a quick note during the cut, or make an audio note? Do you watch all of the 
clips again? 

[15:12] <zipzo989> monkaS 

[15:12] <theycallmejimbob> it's another Pepe emote 

[15:12] <feignit> monkaS 

[15:12] <divanerasmus> what does it loo k like ?

[15:12] <hoboxlO> phil there's a browser extension called betterTTV that adds a bunch of new global emotes 
and lets streamers add even more custom emotes to their channel 
[15:12] <lutherkujo> dspPepe dspPepe 
[15:12] <sherrie92> Ok emote 

[15:13] <quaztang> lol he leaves right as a post my question :( 

[15:13] <theycallmejimbob> it's Pepe startled I think is the best way to describe it DivanErasmus :D

[15:13] <quaztang> nice 

[15:13] <divanerasmus> yeah i saw its pepe

[15:13] <quaztang> oh cool 

[15:13] <hoboxlO> you need the extension to see the emotes but tons of people on twitch use it so it's 
commonplace, almost every big channel has betterttv emotes

I was out and about for a while, so I tipped instead. 

[15:21] <shega_ace> but he won’t receive that tip in February so... how can he transfer it to patreon?

[15:58] <bionich00t> This guy is actually the killer but the game rewards you for doing the pedo. The police are 
corrupt in this game. 

[15:58] <koraea> A 

[15:58] <bionich00t> The husband did it but the cheif wants to charge the pedo 
[15:59] <bepocarrot> you should charge eli, he's seems more sus

[15:59] <pinkdam> is that guy the same guy who was like get the paedo who cares who did it? he changed his 
tune lol

[16:06] <super_slade> It's Jack the Ripper, he's back and he's PISSED 

[16:06] <solid_fantasy> It doesn’t necessarily need the face capture for me to enjoy it, just a game investigating 
crimes and interviewing suspects with high end graphics. Unfortunately it wouldn’t sell because it's not a shooter 
[16:07] <pinkdam> so LA blanc will never be released? aww 
[16:07] <koraea> LA Noire is sponsored by: Zales, the Diamond Store.
