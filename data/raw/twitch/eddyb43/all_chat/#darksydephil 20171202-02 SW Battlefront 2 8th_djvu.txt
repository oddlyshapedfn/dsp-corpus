[20:12] <jannedaarcl35> I feel like a huge weight as been liften off my 
chest 

[20:12] <scoopula> don't forget to get your daily crate 
[20:12] <quinn800> @MountainDewSlayerz they removed mirco transactions 
[20:12] <ornightz> Philss error in P3 was adding members with the 
Diarahan skill in the party , that's why he got his ass kicked Haha LUL 
[20:12] <conky89> for the time 

[20:12] <theadamlee23> OMG, are you kidding me? 

[20:12] <paddingtonbearl87> FailFish 

[20:13] <djrunol> let's hope phil is in a better mood than during cod 
[20:13] <mountaindewslayerz> I don't even understand why people hate the 
ewoks 

[20:13] <paddingtonbearl87> the greens blindes him InuyoFace 
[20:13] <jannedaarcl35> HAHA @ThatAnonyBear Exactly 
[20:13] <bentboxer> ewoks are delicious 

[20:13] <mattty3888> get a keriug and baileys for Xmas stream 
[20:13] <musclesforbones> because ewoks = nazis 

[20:13] <jannedaarcl35> It's now time to retire the need for speed game 
devs name 

[20:13] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Endor on the brain LUL 

[20:13] <0megaj0ker> EA lost so much money and are still doubling down on 
micro transaction 
[20:13] <paddingtonbearl87> xecT 

[20:13] <butter_my_bread> daily crate is always 125 credits and 50 

crafting agents 

[20:13] <bentboxer> ewoks tried to eat luke skywalker 
[20:13] <butter_my_bread> nothing to write home about 

[20:13] <mountaindewslayerz> @0megaj0ker Yeah their stock plummeted after 
the lootbox controversy 

[20:13] <conky89> Their stocks actually dropped down by 3 billion I heard 
[20:14] <scoopula> weird my daily crate was 175 credits and 5 crafting 
parts 

[20:14] <thatanonybear> RaccAttack ewok fucken time 
[20:14] <imaidenr> i beliave we are on Endor. Lol 

[20:14] <butter_my_bread> i heard UFC 3 is full on P2W LUL 

[20:14] <musclesforbones> aim = shit cause stormtrooper LUL 
[20:14] <djrunol> dat lag tho 

[20:14] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> Salty Star Wars hype 

[20:14] <persona3master> I love Persona 3 and the series in general, I 
was so excited and I get blue balled at the final boss of all place wont 
have cared if it was in the middle of the PT but it had to be at the 
final boss that I actually really enjoyed ... sigh 

[20:14] <mountaindewslayerz> I'm not going to be suprised if Disney 
revokes EA's liscense to star wars games 

[20:14] <thatanonybear> @Butter_My_Bread tbf UFC 2 is mostly PSW too 

[20:14] <thatanonybear> UFC3 just steps it up 

[20:14] <kushiyakitori> @DarksydePhil Try something different today like 
every other match switch from 3P to IP or use different classes 



[20:14] <suckasurprise> There aren't any ewok classes in this game are 
there ? 

[20:15] <scoopula> Why would they revoke their Star Wars license? The 
star wars content in this game is 2nd to none. 

[20:15] <mountaindewslayerz> Sscoopula Disney doesn't want any 
controversy surronding their properties 

[20:15] <butter_my_bread> EA -- there's no bigger wretched hive of scum 

and villainy 

[20:15] <mountaindewslayerz> They are spineless 
[20:15] <paddingtonbearl87> makes sense 

[20:15] <butter_my_bread> well fuck UFC in the ear 

[20:15] <paddingtonbearl87> DarkMode

[20:16] <musclesforbones> did phil ever play portal 2? 

[20:16] <thatanonybear> @MusclesForBones i believe so 
[20:16] <0megaj0ker> He played Portal 2 from release 
[20:16] <musclesforbones> thanks 
[20:16] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> @conky89 LUL 
[20:17] <musclesforbones> did he enjoy it? 

[20:17] <thatanonybear> yea 

[20:17] <bammbino> @Butter_My_Bread Vivendi 

[20:17] <0megaj0ker> He enjoyed it I believe 

[20:17] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> @conky89 is your name a reference to 
Conky the puppet? 

[20:17] <mountaindewslayerz> If Disney should the Star Wars license to 
anybody, it should be whoever makes the borderlands series (I forgot 
there name) 

[20:17] <conky89> Kind of...it is a nickname I had in Highschool 

[20:17] <bammbino> @Butter_My_Bread EA is def up there, but Vivendi 

truly takes the cake

[20:18] <ecpz94> trash video gamer 

[20:18] <kinggoken> you can't switch the perspective while playing as

[20:54] kmusclesforbones> all your hair will be gone if you play super 


mario 



[20:54] <conky89> It is considered one of the harder mario games 

[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> I dont remember super mario sunshine being 

hard 

[20:54] <musclesforbones> rekt, just like my first gangbang Kappa 
[20:54] <crystallaser> He's playing it next year right? 

[20:54] <thatanonybear> there are some tough sections in SMS 
[20:54] <zombiebeer> did phil ever play luigi's mansion 
[20:54] <neospartanhesperos9> i thought super mario 3 was the hardest 
i've ever played 

[20:55] <0megaj0ker> Sunshine's level are kinda hard, but not hair 
tearing 

[20:55] <conky89> thats what people say. 100% is difficult 

[20:55] <musclesforbones> the hardest mario i ever played was the atari 

LUL 

[20:55] <paddingtonbearl87> mario 2: the lost levels is the hardest shit 
i played NotLikeThis 

[20:55] <conky89> though the blue coins are bullshit 
[20:55] <pinkdam> and the 6 golden coins 

[20:56] <paddingtonbearl87> i remmember that on the good ole gameboy 
[20:56] <lestertheunlikelyl3> @thatanonybear Sthatanonybear sorry games

DendiFace 

[20:56] <thatanonybear> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 interesting selection, 
pretty good games tbh 

[20:56] <thatanonybear> Hitman is very hood, i hear 
[20:56] <neospartanhesperos9> game can be boring sometimes 
[20:57] <mattty3888> coffee!

[20:57] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Sthatanonybear yea but Sony is annoying so 
I'm Xbox from now on 

[20:57] <theadamlee23> Galactic Conquest? You meant Galactic Assault? 
[20:57] <neospartanhesperos9> BlessRNG 

[20:58] <markymark52> Forget the "Pay to win." The game is unbalanced 
even with it exlcuded. Star Cards and upgrades that make the game 
unbalanced at the start. 

[20:58] <thatanonybear> @LesterTheUnlikelyl3 NITW is on Xbox now so it's 
a good time to switch :D 

[20:58] <0megaj0ker> Super Mario Sunshine has a really good OST 
[20:58] <musclesforbones> hardcore parkour 

[20:58] <neospartanhesperos9> @TheAdamlee23 Same shit, whatever LUL 
[20:58] <paddingtonbearl87> @0megaj0ker and graphics considering its age 
[20:58] <paddingtonbearl87> plus it has option for 480p

pushed stone cold steve austin 

[21:01] <neospartanhesperos9> weren't people in phil

Cuphead dude LUL 

[21:01] <thatanonybear> this online match is kinda fucked 
[21:01] <gettwobirdsstonedatonce> LUL the stormtrooper run looks like a 
monkey from planet of the apes 

[21:02] <thatanonybear> @NeoSpartanHesperos9 they were impatient for him 
to play Terraria 

[21:02] <lestertheunlikelyl3> Sthatanonybear if I ship a ps4 will it get 
lost in mail? 

[21:02] <neospartanhesperos9> =/

trusted company

the package to his own house by accident 
[21:03] <tantamounter> cheerl50

when u paid for the Dishonored 2 die that dsp would entreat u to some 
NITW?

mean : P 

[21:04] <paddingtonbearl87> how was that mean 



[21:04] <markymark52> cheerlO doesn't matter if they took out the micro 
transactions. The game is unbalanced when the match starts with lame ass 
Star Cards and Gun upgrades. New players are screwed.

MrDestructoid :gun: popsicSmug 
[22:38] <darksydetoxic> Star Wars Loot Box 2 

[22:38] <neospartanhesperos9> why was Jango allowed to be cloned anyways 
[22:39] <popsicolo> He was a prime human 

[22:39] <neospartanhesperos9> but what did he want back for getting 
cloned 

[22:39] <eldeadmariachi> @neospartanhesperos9 They were making clones of 
the best soldiers, omething like that 

[22:39] <popsicolo> That's a good question. As with any other piece of 
Star Wars lore I wonder about. There's probably an answer out there 
somewhere. 

[22:40] <eldeadmariachi> i haven't watch Attack of the clones in a while 
[22:40] <neospartanhesperos9> Jango was a mandolrian hunter, he wouldn't 
give himself over to be cloned for an army for the jedi, unless he knew 
about order 66

anti consumer if u look at from the players perspective, the least they 
can do is increase earn rates. that bs about how they wanted to blance it
