[12:27] <orcsrdorks7> cheer50 I once had one of your stalkers tell me not to give you money LOL 

[12:27] <dragonpoison> @theotherpoolboy What does that have to do with him not doing anything useful about 

his financial state? 

[12:27] <bethebaby> @proprime According to him, he still makes more on Twitch and what-not than what he’d 
make working a "regular" job. 

[12:27] <slowjoee> i like pubg on xbox AngryJack 

[12:27] <theotherpoolboy> @dragonpoison uh obviously because streaming games and entertaining people is his 

job and hes offering such a great bang for ur buck 

[12:27] <wouldyoulikesomeballz> Home Alone 3 SnowSing 

[12:27] <proprime> @bethebaby then he fucked up financially because he didn't save for taxes. No one elses 
problem. 

[12:28] <bethelewd> FUCK TAX 

[12:28] <masterxeon2002> has phil stopped uploading prestreams to DSPGaming? 



[12:28] <grizzzly> i like my real job rather than be a internet beggar

[12:28] <encelor> zambies 

[12:28] <chairmancaleb> Taxes are unfortunately necessary. Stuff like our roads, education system, police, 
firemen. I believe those are essential. Not EVERYTHING needs to be taxed though. 

[12:28] <succkonlemon> WutFace 

[12:28] <arcticsurface> I had these too, i fucking hate them. 

[12:28] <bethelewd> i had all those dreams as well

[12:29] <theycallmejimbob> dspPepe 

[12:29] <proprime> @bethebaby You know what you are going to owe in taxes for the whole year. If you don’t 
save the money to pay it then you screwed up. Makes no sense to me. 

[12:29] <onlydarkhearts> dspPepe 

[12:29] <bethebaby> The only nightmares I have are about are nuclear war.

[12:30] <kinggoken> oh wow he hasn't started yet lol 

[12:30] <gamemaster2003isdead> i liked the movie 

[12:30] <bethebaby> @proprime You're not wrong, but it's not like it's compulsory for any of us to chip in. Phil’ 
not demanding that anyone donate, just asking. 

[12:30] <kinggoken> i took a shit, took a shower and he still hasn't started lrnao 
[12:30] <clunkyd> okay

[12:31] <theycallmejimbob> I never seen that coming 

[12:31] <slowjoee> he wants to beat it 

[12:31] <kinggoken> Fighting EX layer was hype 

[12:31] <proprime> @bethebaby I know he is just asking. It’s just frustrating to see a grown man not do what he 
has to so he doesn’t lose his house. If you have to take a few months off to get a regular job and save then so be it. 
[12:31] <dragonpoison> @theotherpoolboy He is in this financial state because of the "job" he has chosen, and 
now begs his followers and fans for money instead of doing anything about it himself. As you may have already 
noticed, Phil is not a big streamer nor a big Youtuber. He is not financial stable in order to continue with this 
"career". You have to adapt in order to survive.

[13:24] <cybot86> @KingOfHypocrisy Disney owns the OT. Expect porn and violence in every scene and the 
Sand People renamed to "native tattooinians"

[13:25] <hero2zerooo> Hello Phil and chat! caleb3 caleb4 



[13:25] <cybot86> @BeTheLewd Nope. They changed what happened in Post production 

[13:25] <kingofhypocrisy> Lucas and Disney are just using the IP as a ATM and the fansboy love all the 

mediocre trash 

[13:25] <encelor> @Hero2Zerooo hey dood 

[13:25] <cybot86> just like when they dubbed vader's line in Empire

[13:26] <encelor> darth maul PogChamp 

[13:26] <kushiyakitori> splash ground next to him or the wall behind him would have damaged him behind 

cover if that was what actually did it 

[13:26] <bentboxer> spoiler alert luke drinks blue milk 

[13:26] <bethelewd> so he must of done other things as well but disney went with the the first one

[13:26] <rotoch4mp> the splash was glitched out 

[13:26] <bethelewd> cybot maybe they wanted to surprise EVEN HIM 

[13:26] <cybot86> the series itself has set a precedent of having one script for the cast and one script for the 
creators.

[13:41] <mikkael86> <lButtonDash> yup Crait is awesome 

[13:41] <cybot86> There's only one death STAR that needs to be destroyed. 

[13:41] < 1 buttondash> @quinn800 and i still can't be behind the star card thing just being behind crates, playing 
classes should earn u stuff for those classes 

[13:41] <cookiemonster414> @kingofhypocrisy well that conversation is very uninteresting 2 me so im just 
gonna watch the stream. 

[13:42] <cybot86> @DarksydePhil how do you feel about disney describing the Empire as a "White Supremacist 
Organization"? 

[13:42] <quinn800> @lButtonDash it does though 

[13:42] <kingofhypocrisy> I wonder if their going to have a fleet of death stars in TLJ 
[13:42] <cybot86> Do you agree? 

[ 13:42] < 1 buttondash> just weapons 

[13:42] <lbuttondash> not more cards/abilities 

[13:42] <water_closet> damn bro ur good 

[13:42] <bentboxer> the empire is no more its the first order 

[13:42] <kingofhypocrisy> The Last Deaths tar 

[13:42] <cybot86> @bentboxer So Phil is a nazi for playing that side?

[13:43] <lbuttondash> @quinn800 like i enjoy playing the deathtrooper, when i spend the BP to use him, i 
should be earning new deathtrooper cards 
[13:43] <infinite_55> dspNothing 

[13:43] <bethelewd> i do i prefer the empire over first order 

[13:43] <quinn800> @lButtonDash well all you have to do is play four not five games open 5 crates and get the 
crafting points which can be rewarded from awards and craft the star cards 
[13:43] <water_closet> play panzer dragoon saga :D being craving it 
[13:43] <mikkael86> @Cybot86 For the Empire!!! 

[13:43] <cybot86> Because the first order makes zero sense 
[13:43] <rotoch4mp> im all about the empire 

[13:43] <kingofhypocrisy> @BeTheLewd Are you saying Fill is lying? That sounds like detractor talk Kappa 
[13:43] <bentboxer> there was an asian guy in the first order so it cant be a white supremacist org 
[13:43] <cybot86> Nazis! 

[13:44] <bethelewd> first order was created out of the remains of the empire 
[13:44] <theycallmejimbob> :o BeTheLewd 
[13:44] <cybot86> @bentboxer tell that to Disney 

[13:44] <dovahruum> @DarksydePhil your thoughts on the last jedi? are you going to do a review?

[13:51] <cybot86> What the fuck was i banned for? Saying that RLM lied on twitter? 

[13:51] <kingofhypocrisy> Ricky Gervais is the top pick 

[13:51] <water_closet> Someone was spamming it earlier in random stream 

[13:51] <kushiyakitori> @WouldYouLikeSomeBallz Danny DeVito

[13:52] <cybot86> It's funny how so many people were worried about net neutrality banning people from 

websites but they have no qualms against doing it themselves 

[13:52] <fhrffymoochicken> Dwayne Johnson can just play everyone in the movie 

[13:52] <eyesonwater> meant dante but kevin works too

[13:55] <lbuttondash> trump will if he runs again

was proven wrong so 

[13:56] <cybot86> @fluffymoochicken They can still steal things. 

[13:56] <fluffymoochicken> I don’t know about GOP nominating Trump either 
[13:56] <samrlaseter> how's everyone’s weekend so far 
[13:56] <cybot86> small things 

[13:56] <kingofhypocrisy> Roy moore had too much baggage 

[13:56] <bethebaby> @KingOfHypocrisy Twist ending: Trump is The Rock's boss, so as soon as they enter the 
ring he just yells "YOU’RE FIRED" and wins. 

[13:56] <cybot86> especially when they use #metoo for political purposes

[13:59] <bethelewd> phil will die again 

[13:59] <samrlaseter> the last jedi was a pretty lame movie imo

[14:00] <bethebaby> What a nice whisper I got! 

[14:00] <bethebaby> I approve. 

[14:00] <kingofhypocrisy> Luke uses the force to take a massive shit,, he's been constipated for weeks

[14:01] <lbuttondash> sniper is good on this map 

[14:01] <divanerasmus> hi @DarksydePhil hello @everyone 

[14:01] <chairmancaleb> If you really want to get technical about it, Star Wars episode7+ aren't really 
considered canon since they're not by Georgie. 

[14:01] <chairmancaleb> That’s the way I look at it anyway. 

[14:01] <musclesforbones> technically nothings a cannon unless it shoots cannon balls LUL 
[14:02] <kingofhypocrisy> George should of went with Darth Jar Jar but he pussied out 

[14:02] <fhrffymoochicken> This map reminds me of when DSP played that Normandy beach one in CoD WW2 
[14:02] <fhrffymoochicken> Holy cow out of the draw distance 

[14:02] <solid_fantasy> They're numbered and treated as canon. Also , Lucas didn’t direct ESB 
[14:03] <therealkingghidorah> @DarksydePhil you can use the walkers legs for cover 
[14:03] <samrlaseter> Has phil seen last Jedi yet? 

[14:03] <bethebaby> You think Phil's opponents say the same things he does when he kills them? 

[14:03] <fluffymoochicken> Beautiful graphics 
[14:03] <bethebaby> @SamRLaseter No. 

[14:03] <cybot86> @SamRLaseter No that's why he's not sad. 

[14:03] <encelor> is this australia red dirt and rocks 

[14:03] <chairmancaleb> @solid_fantasy I know they’re "treated" as such, not denying that. But I look at it like 
Dragon Ball for example. GT wasn’t made by Akira Toriyama, so it's not canon. 

[14:03] <fortunemoney> this game still worth it on sale ? 

[14:03] <chairmancaleb> That’s h ow I see Episode 7 and 8. 

[14:03] <musclesforbones> phil, you can use blankets for cover 
[14:03] <cybot86> Nu Wars isn't canon 
[14:03] <lbuttondash> can’t deny the visuals in this game 
[14:03] <mxavier91> not a very profitable stream today.... 

[14:03] <cybot86> it's just designed to destroy what we value as a society 
[14:03] <solid_fantasy> Phil hasn't seen TLJ, he has no free time 

[14:04] <samrlaseter> @solid_fantasy makes sense, I don't know anyone who works as much as DSP 
[14:04] <cybot86> Luke Skywalker got married and had kids. He did not die a virgin. 

[14:04] <encelor> phil is a workhorse Kappa

are here because they enjoy you as a streamer and they would still be here if you were playing a game you 



enjoyed. The star wars games for super nintendo were incredible and I doubt people would enjoy seeing 
something from Dice over a 30 year old game.

[16:11] <encelor> GTAB lowlife specimen Keepo 

[16:11] <bethebaby> When will people realize that real detractors/trolls don't give Phil money? Anyone claiming 
to be a detractor and donating is just an average generic looking for attention.

[16:12] <musclesforbones> real trolls live under bridges and eat billy goats :( scary 
[16:12] <tomahawkings> Kylo seemed like an epic character in the movies. Until he took his mask of

[16:12] <encelor> @tomahawkings i agree LUL

[16:13] <solid_fantasy> It's literally counterproductive to your detracting 

[16:13] <gezoral999> no one is paying money to be a detractor 

[16:13] <gezoral999> troll subs are all prime 

[16:13] <vendatus> Then again it's Adam Driver KappaPride 

[16:14] <encelor> prime sub still gets Fil money 

[16:14] <solid_fantasy> Phil says he still gets the money 

[16:14] <gezoral999> but they aren’t paying money for it 

[16:14] <neospartanhesperos9> Isn't that one professor in Harry Potter that's always dressed in black also has 
Kylo's nose? And look at how scary and menacing he was. I think Kylo's face is fine. 

[16:14] <masternutella> "one of our best agent just arrive!"' weird voice acting lol 



[16:14] <encelor> snape? 

[16:14] <leonaras> Subbing to dave regardless gives him money and is counterproductive if you are a detractor 
[16:14] <neospartanhesperos9> yep 

[16:14] <thatanonyraccoon> @Gezoral999 of course they are, they're usually paying for Amazon Prime, then 

transfer that to Twitch

[16:15] <taymanicel234> I find it kinda funny if Phil really wanted to keep his house all he would have to do is 

sellout to YouTube media he make like a shot tone of money

[16:15] <lord_edmund_blackadder> Different game mode perhaps, @DarksydePhil 

[16:15] <solid_fantasy> he's still getting money though which goes against the goals of a detractor. They love 
attention though and can't help themselves 

[16:16] <vendatus> Encelor mine isn't so hairy so it's an ewok Kappa 

[16:16] <duderito2> didn’t they use to sub to Phil's patreon so they could have screenshot the private forums, in
