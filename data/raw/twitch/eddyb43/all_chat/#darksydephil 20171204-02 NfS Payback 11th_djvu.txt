[18:04] <kill4death03> hi 

[18:39] <alec_aquinO> would anyone consider Phil to be a nice person? 
[19:30] <suckasurprise> NFS time tpYGOcreepy 
[19:33] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:33] <darksydephil> just adding vids to playlist, then we'll get 
started 

[19:34] <jannedaarcl35> Hey, Phil :) 

[19:34] <vendatus> SeemsGood 
[19:34] <gojirakunpls> Yoooo 

[19:34] <jannedaarcl35> How was the Sunday NFS stream everyone? I missed 
it >. < 

[19:34] <gojirakunpls> Is this gonna be the Conclusion for real this 
time, hopefully? 

[19:35] <cresstheangel> probably not, since offroad races are next 
[19:35] <suckasurprise> @JanneDaArcl35 Stream was entertaining, Phil got 
stuck in the current series of races he's in though 
[19:35] <majinboo3> today might be the end of the playthrough 
[19:36] <suckasurprise> He's been at them for a while 

[19:36] <gojirakunpls> Meh, regardless I wish Phil the best of luck with 
this game 

[19:36] <majinboo3> the next race is even harder then the race hes on NOW 
[19:36] <goldencolts> HELLO 

[19:36] <jannedaarcl35> Ssuckasurprise Thanks! I really like his NFS 
streams 

[19:36] <gojirakunpls> ayo 

[19:36] <cresstheangel> yeah the next race is HELL 
[19:36] <jannedaarcl35> Hey goldencolts :) 

[19:36] <majinboo3> lets be honest This game is without a doubt the WORST 
racing game of all time 
[19:36] <majinboo3> by far 

[19:36] <suckasurprise> @JanneDaArcl35 NP, I'm really digging the NFS 
streams too 

[19:37] <gojirakunpls> @majinboo3 It's a shameless cash grab bruv 
[19:37] <gojirakunpls> so many games today are cash crabs 
[19:37] <gojirakunpls> It's saddening 

[19:38] <cresstheangel> playing xenoblade 2 and its honestly tied as my 
goty so far

[19:51] <trihard41iife> not having pre streams would, probably help but

[19:51] <sidella434> Phil you deserrve your time off :) 

[19:51] <bentboxer> phil how do you get psvue on your other tvs, do you 
just download the app onto the tvs? 

[19:51] <neospartanhesperos9> Phil's voice muscles are sore. Should take 
some post workout CoolStoryBob 

[19:51] <trihard41iife> 100% gameplay would work better for the throat 
[19:52] <poopshortsjr> Phil needs to learn how to drive. It's not Mario 
Kart. You need to slow down and take the correct racing line.

[19:56] <bentboxer> top 3 xmas movies die hard, love actually, the night 
before 

[19:56] <bentboxer> home alone 

[19:56] <nasklaf> Maybe don't put that many videos at once. 

[19:56] <majinboo3> youtube doesnt plan for people to upload 15 videos a 
day lol 

[19:56] <nolbert87> Sbentboxer nice 

[19:56] <theasianentrepreneur> 10 vids at a time lol 
[19:56] <kill4death03> maybe because your PC specs 

[19:56] <i_came_here_to_something> @theasianentrepreneur But he needs 
views; it's not always about playing relaxing games. He played Spyro 
recently; it's a good game and he seemed to enjoy it, but it made for a 
very boring stream 

[19:57] <majinboo3> Thats just not true lol i dont think phil realizes 

how much bandwith youtube uses 

[19:57] <goldencolts> oh shit youtube cops 

[19:57] <yolodopper> cheerlO can you upgrade your internet speed to get 
the uploads up faster? 

[19:58] <theasianentrepreneur> @I_Came_Here_To_Something i know but if he 
plays a certain amount of hours and doesnt like it he should stop 
otherwise it could destroy his mood and wastes unnecessary energy 
[19:58] <neoperpetualtman94> I guess I'll join. 

[19:58] <kill4death03> only 10k people 



[19:58] <sidella434> OMG 

[19:58] <reggieface420> the problem is humans make mistakes, lots of 
them, or simply don't care or pay attention 

[19:58] <majinboo3> Shit im gonna apply for that position LOL get paid 

for watching youtube videos 

[19:58] <majinboo3> thats free money 

[19:58] <theasianentrepreneur> @majinboo3 Kappa 

[19:58] <i_came_here_to_something> fuck it, I'll apply too 

[19:58] <bentboxer> whoppers for 6 bucks??! im never eating healthy 

again! 

[19:58] <reggieface420> they will mark every reported video as non advert 
friendly 

[19:58] <reggieface420> LUL 
[19:58] <goldencolts> its 2 for 6 

[19:59] <bethebaby> Applicants will probably have to have a Ivy League 
degree, just to watch Youtube vids all day. 

[19:59] <majinboo3> only ive league assholes are qualified to determine 
whats appropriate for ads 

[19:59] <reggieface420> 10,000 ivy league grads watching dsp videos 

[19:59] <reggieface420> LUL 

[19:59] <goldencolts> cheer25 cheer25 

[19:59] <bentboxer> 10k full time hall pass monitors working at google 
[20:00] <reggieface420> humans won't work, they make too many mistakes, 
it'll likely be worse than the automatic system 
[20:00] <poopshortsjr> Ew. 

[20:00] <katexo234> dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp 

[20:00] <i_came_here_to_something> TBF isn't it up to the channel owners 
to moderate the comments? 

[20:00] <poopshortsjr> Why do some people like children? 

[20:00] <paddingtonbearl87> what kinda piece of trash thinks about having 
sex with a 7 year old 

[20:00] <thatindieglo> Didn't they fire all of them before? 

[20:00] <bentboxer> thank you come again 
[20:00] <majinboo3> Indians will just troll 
[20:00] <poopshortsjr> India needs jobs, Phil. 

[20:01] <sidella434> they took ojur jobs 

[20:01] <arnity> Lol and so many software developers are Indians there :0 
[20:01] <reggieface420> does the average indian have a strong enough 
grasp of english to tell if something is or isn't advertiser friendly 
[20:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Youtube's not going anywhere 
[20:01] <majinboo3> youtube is dead 

[20:01] <i_came_here_to_something> Not now, since net neutrality is 
effectively dead 

[20:01] <sidella434> youtube is stupid 

[20:01] <arnity> @reggieface420 A lot of people in India know English 
[20:01] <poopshortsjr> Indians from the developed parts are smart. 

[20:01] <gdayguy36> Are you gonna shit talk youtube every night? 

[20:01] <reggieface420> youtube is doomed its too big, at this point its 
too big to police they can't do anything, it was only a matter of time 
until the bubble burst 

[20:01] <reggieface420> 10,000 ppl won't do shit 

[20:02] <i_came_here_to_something> No other video platforms besides 
Twitch and Bing can compete with Google's money; everyone else will be 
limited by slow and low bandwidth for their content 



[20:02] <wreckstatus> thank god the comments are so disgusting 
[20:02] <thatindieglo> Amazon should YT and bring it back otherwise 
CrreamAwk 

[20:02] <poopshortsjr> People thought I was Phil in the comments. 

[20:02] <kill4death03> @DarksydePhil Phil why you don't start using a 

green screen i think it is a good upgrade 

[20:02] <astolfosbf> cahman youtube 

[20:02] <theasianentrepreneur> liquid shit lol 

[20:02] <thatindieglo> Buy* 

[20:02] <spergmcburg> tahk sick 

[20:02] <poopshortsjr> Because I was the only one saying nice things. 
[20:02] <majinboo3> well we have to wait to see how the net neutrality 
vote goes 

[20:02] <gdayguy36> Youtube put you in that house though bruh 
[20:03] <tylerjku> pull my finger 

[20:03] <nasklaf> I think I would watch more of your videos if you didn't 
upload 20 15-minute chunks of gameplay. 

[20:03] <i_came_here_to_something> @reggieface420 In terms of 
monetization, maybe yeah. But Youtube used to be more entertaining/unique 
in content when there wasn't big money involved tbh. So there's something 
good that'll maybe come out of the advertisers leaving 
[20:03] <sfkingalpha> Hey twitch and youtube is usually a side job. 

[20:03] <majinboo3> WRONG 
[20:03] <astolfosbf> bruh 

[20:03] <thatindieglo> duDudu duDudu duDudu 
[20:03] <ningen_sama> What about Leanna wtf? 

[20:03] <tincanhobo> @gdayguy36 fake news 

[20:03] <elcspx> yt = prank videos and fake drama for teens LUL 
[20:03] <gojirakunpls> youtube is a greed machine 
[20:03] <bentboxer> leanna did nothing but sell soaps 
[20:03] <theasianentrepreneur> Squidward "fuuuuuuuuture" 

[20:03] <majinboo3> I mean to be fair machinima did save your ass for 
partnering you 

[20:04] <tylerjku> fuckin soap 

[20:04] <i_came_here_to_something> Kappa 

[20:04] <reggieface420> youtube's platform certainly helped 

[20:04] <gdayguy36> Well if youtube didn't exist, you've not been able to 

do what you did 

[20:04] <nasklaf> Phil said "fronting"...wow. 

[20:04] <reggieface420> if millions of people didnt go to youtube 
millions of people wouldn't have watched your video 

[20:04] <i_came_here_to_something> Phil you gotta give Youtube *some* 
credit at least 

[20:04] <thatindieglo> PowerUpL BURN! PowerUpR 

[20:04] <britz94xd> Laveria Media put you in the house Kappa 

[20:04] <poopshortsjr> What if Google buys Twitch? 

[20:04] <mujtabal2321> can the prestreams be shorter on the second 
streams? its past 11pm here and i got an 8am class lol 
[20:04] <thatindieglo> Lol 

[20:04] <tylerjku> LONGER dspSexy DEEPER dspSexy HARDER dspSexy 
[20:04] <sfkingalpha> Lets see how tired I am today! 

[20:04] <chairmancaleb> @gdayguy36 If there wasn't a YouTube, there would 
be something else in its place. Technology has evolved to the point where 



it would be impossible for there not to be a successful video sharing 
platform. 

[20:05] <theasianentrepreneur> @DarksydePhil January Patreon: GTA Trilogy 
Redemption Run Kappa 

[20:05] <i_came_here_to_something> No Youtube = no platform for your vids 
= no viewers = no Machinima = no money :/. At least back until you 
switched to Twitch and such. 

[20:05] <thatindieglo> The difficulty on affects the time limit 
[20:05] <vendatus> Google can't buy twitch Amazon beat them to it LUL 
[20:05] <goldencolts> cmonBruh 

[20:05] <reggieface420> is twitch that profitable? i'm not sure it is 
[20:05] <poopshortsjr> YouTube happened to be the platform. 

[20:05] <majinboo3> LOL 
[20:05] <astolfosbf> uh oh 

[20:05] <mr5twitch> @chairmancaleb but it'd still be the same idea phil 
still needs the platform 

[20:05] <goldencolts> phil dont open any of your mail 
[20:06] <katexo234> wtf ugh ok 

[20:06] <theasianentrepreneur> I would @DarksydePhil would donate to ur 
patreon if u did GTA Original Trilogy on redemption run lol 
[20:06] <concretecasket> cheerlOO 

[20:06] <poopshortsjr> It could have been RedTube. 

[20:06] <ornightz> cheerlO Have you ever watched Classic martial Arts 
Films , not the Mainstream ones 

[20:06] <tylerjku> ill tell you what, even waaayyy bigger youtube 
channels are making no money on the platform, dont feel alienated 
[20:06] <reggieface420> sometimes terrible games are the most 
entertaining ones 

[20:06] <sfkingalpha> What a jack ass piece of shit 

[20:06] <chairmancaleb> @reggieface420 Your main income comes from two 
sources: Subscriptions, cheers and tipping. It all depends on the 
activity of the viewers per stream. It's an unreliable source imo unless 
you're someone like sodapoppin. 

[20:06] <sfkingalpha> I really hate this game guys!!@!!1212121 
[20:06] <chairmancaleb> Sreggieface420 meant to say three. 

[20:07] <astolfosbf> Santa Clause 
[20:07] <suckasurprise> Jingle all the way 
[20:07] <katexo234> a wonderful life 
[20:07] <astolfosbf> starring Tim Allen 
[20:07] <sidella434> I love it 

[20:07] <tincanhobo> Ssfkingalpha you talkin bout yourself or did I miss 
somethin? 

[20:07] <goldencolts> national lampoon Christmas vacation 
[20:07] <bentboxer> tim the tool man tayor Christmas movies? 

[20:07] <jannedaarcl35> SGoldenColts YES 

[20:07] <i_came_here_to_something> @ChairmanCaleb There's already been 
^several* things besides Youtube. VidMe (getting shut down, net 
neutrality bs), Dailymotion, etc. But none of them had Google's money 
behind them. If more people went to those platforms when money was 
floating to YT from advertisers, things would be a lot different today. 
[20:07] <poopshortsjr> That's why Phil bases his finances off of the 
hardcore viewers. 

[20:07] <concretecasket> home alone with Joe Pesci 
[20:07] <ornightz> gradma got run over by a raindeer 



[20:07] <thatindieglo> Frosty the snowman?

[20:08] <goldencolts> true Christmas kino 

[20:08] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something If YouTube didn't 
exist, one of them would have taken its place in terms of being the 
monopoly is what I meant. Not that there isn't any others that exist. 
[20:08] <ornightz> Not another Teen Movie LUL 

[20:08] <katexo234> Jack Frost starring Michael keaton LUL LUL 
[20:08] <nolbert87> Forgot about the muppet one, I gotta watch that 
again, havent seen that one in a long time 
[20:08] <poopshortsjr> Build a PC, Phil. It's ez. 

[20:08] <bentboxer> harold and kumar goes to Christmas 

[20:08] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something You're forgetting 

Google didn't used to own YouTube.

[20:10] <bentboxer> jackie chan join wwe more than ufc hes master of fake 
fighting 

[20:10] <bollocksjones> Good 

[20:10] <i_came_here_to_something> @ChairmanCaleb No I remember when 
Google wasn't involved; that's when Youtube was actually really good. I 
just meant that since Youtube got purchased by Google, they had the money 
to become what they are today. The other sites never had as big a 
userbase even before Google purchased Youtube, and it's the userbase size 
why they got purchased to begin with. 

[20:10] <ornightz> Those are the Mainstream ones I'm talking like 5 

fingers shaolin 

[20:10] <elcspx> monkaS 

[20:10] <reggieface420> that'd be a close one poopshortsjr but i think 
jackie might just beat him out Kappa 

[20:10] <i_came_here_to_something> IIRC Google doesn't even make a profit 
from owning Youtube 

[20:10] <ornightz> Or something like that 
[20:10] <goldencolts> DatSheffy

[20:10] <leewanner> @I_Came_Here_To_Something - You are 100% correct. 
[20:10] <nolbert87> its Elon musk 

[20:11] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something The userbase for 
YouTube was already at a staggering high before Google came along, let's 
not try and pretend like YouTube was this little side project beforehand. 



[20:11] <katexo234> dspSurpriseddsp 
[20:11] <goldencolts> its DatSheffy 

[20:11] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something So "Google's money" is 
sort of irrelevant in what I was talking about. 

[20:11] <paddingtonbearl87> xecDJ 
[20:11] <kekon3> DatShefty 

[20:11] <leewanner> @I_Came_Here_To_Something - Or if I understand you to 
mean that Youtube wasn't dog shit before google bought it, then you'd be 
right.

[20:12] <kill4death03> i tried to refresh and i am on desktop 
[20:12] <i_came_here_to_something> SChairmanCaleb No that's what I'm 
acknowledging actually. Google purchased them ^because* their userbase 
was already so large. Google doesn't get money from Youtube itself, but 
(I'm assuming) from the advertisers using the platform 

[20:12] <coralguy> Phil if I the viewer help pay for your crib, I need

[20:13] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something So why did you even 
bring up Google when the main topic was "There would have been someone 
else in YoUTube's place if YouTube didn't exist."? 

[20:13] <e_machinel4> #partyatphils spread the word

got to reset 

[20:14] <i_came_here_to_something> @LeeWanner Old school Youtube was the 
shit. Some people still put that kind of content up now, problem is it's 
very difficult to find them in searches. Usually you have to hope a 
somewhat more popular channel has the lesser-known ones in their network 
or in their recommendations

[20:16] <bentboxer> phil is too young to have a heart attack 
[20:16] <i_came_here_to_something> SChairmanCaleb B/c I'm trying to 
illustrate the importance of Google in turning Youtube into the money¬ 
making machine (for advertisers and content providers) it became, and 
that they only bought YT b/c of the size of its userbase. Other sites 
like Dailymotion didn't have that userbase size so I doubt Google 
would've purchased them at the time. And if Amazon bought Twitch anyhow, 
people would've just went to Twitch even sooner than they have 
[20:17] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Yes ... because YouTUbe 
is the monopoly....? If YouTube didn't exist, someone else would have had 
the monopoly. Can we stop now? Lol 

[20:17] <0000anonymous> @DarksydePhil chrome uses a suspension method for

[20:18] <astolfosbf> Eyes on the road phil 

[20:18] <i_came_here_to_something> @ChairmanCaleb Then it would've been 
Twitch, so a lot of the stuff Phil's complaining about on YT, you could 
just put Twitch in its place. Guess I'm just saying he shouldn't take it 
so personally.

[20:19] <chairmancaleb> @I_Came_Here_To_Something Twitch is a bit 
different to be fair, where it's main focus relies on livestreaming 
rather than offline video sharing. I agree w/ your last point though. He 




shouldn't take it so personally. Content creation is a fluctuating

[22:54] <plizzat5> 2010 is still credible lol 

[22:54] <kodykarls> 2010 was a great year, so memorable 

[22:54] <kodykarls> Some really funny playthroughs/great games 

[22:55] <plizzat5> i really like the old bioshcok playthroughs 

[22:55] <kodykarls> That was when he had a camera that couldn't zoom in 

during the video LUL 

[22:55] <plizzat5> and gta 

[22:56] <kodykarls> Yeah, his GTA III/VC/SA playthroughs were funny af 
[22:57] <plizzat5> ha ya his old setup was gimp 

[22:58] <kodykarls> He played games in complete darkness, I would have 
probably been annoyed if I had to play like that 

[23:00] <kodykarls> I liked the John Rambo co-op, that was always a blast 
on the weekends 

[23:00] <plizzat5> it was a different time ha I don't think he thought it 
would be a full time thing but who knows 

[23:01] <plizzat5> ya it was a different phil in Connecticut 
[23:01] <plizzat5> John Rambo is funny as he'll tho 
[23:01] <kodykarls> I love his "don't give a shit" additude 
[23:02] <kodykarls> And that big nose of his Kappa 
[23:02] <plizzat5> lawl 

[23:03] <kodykarls> I feel like he's been the only person who has been 
able to really bounce off of DSP's jokes 

[23:03] <plizzat5> ya well when you get into a relationship it tends to 
tear friends aparr 
[23:03] <plizzat5> apart 

[23:03] <darksydephil> yeah John was great for improv comedy, some of the 
best reactions/comebacks to stuff that we did 
[23:04] <plizzat5> yo phil ha 

[23:05] <kodykarls> For sure, I liked his reaction to driving to Delaware 
LUL 



[23:05] <kodykarls> Good times 

[23:06] <plizzat5> I lost a good job in 09 similar to dsp 
[23:06] <kodykarls> How long did it take to find a new job? 

[23:07] <plizzat5> on and off never did the economy is still shaky 
[23:07] <plizzat5> sucks 

[23:07] <kodykarls> Yeah, most of my money comes from tips (delivery 
driver) 

[23:08] <darksydephil> i honestly dunno if my getting into a relationship 
is what led to my friendship with John decaying, I mean, we still did 
stuff regularly even when I was dating her, before I moved that is. I 
just think he might of been looking for way more in the friendship, while 
I thought he was really enjoying gaming weekly, but in reality I don't 
think he really did enjoy it and was only doing it for the money after 
the first 1-2 years 

[23:09] <kodykarls> He had to have enjoyed it at first 

[23:09] <darksydephil> I could definitely tell his attitude changed, like 
when we started he was amped to play anything, but by 2012 it was more 
like "yeah i'll just play whatever you set up" 

[23:09] <kodykarls> Be you didn't make $ off of it until 2011 
[23:09] <kodykarls> But yeah, people put on a facade around others 
[23:10] <kodykarls> You don't know what they really feel 
[23:10] <darksydephil> well yeah, he started coming by weekly in late 
2010 when i got laid off. then when he lost his job in 2011 i started 
paying him weekly for the stuff he was in 

[23:10] <darksydephil> i honestly think he didn't enjoy it much but just 
kept doing it to make money be he needed the money bad 
[23:11] <plizzat5> he's still a character and enjoyed his humor 
[23:11] <darksydephil> yeah he definitely was a great part of everything 
for those first few years, 2010-2013 

[23:11] <kodykarls> Yeah, I noticed that around the time he wanted to 
focus on his YouTube videos more (like that Holepunch series) 

[23:11] <darksydephil> exactly 

[23:12] <darksydephil> as soon as Project 7 fell apart it seems thats 
when ALL the resentment started toward me in 2012, but nobody actually 
told me about it 

[23:12] <darksydephil> so John kept showing up to play and take a 
paycheck but really didn't care that much, only wanted to do his 
Holepunch stuff 

[23:12] <darksydephil> sad be if anybody has just told me what was going 
on, i would have taken care of it immediately, but i never knew any o fit 
[23:13] <gutty333> you all should make peace, friends are an important 
part of life 

[23:13] <kodykarls> Yeah, I can see how that was a slap in the face, be 
John/Howard obviously had a lot built up 

[23:13] <darksydephil> that shit is long in the past now Gutty lol 
[23:14] <kodykarls> Idk why people don't just speak up, and voice their 
concerns, nothing is gonna get done otherwise 

[23:15] <darksydephil> if they'd actually had any real interest in 
talking, they would have. I was the one messaging them for a year and not 
getting any responses. THey made zero effort to ever talk to me about any 
of it, then made that video 2 years ago. When you ignore someone for a 
year and then make a public video to slam them instead of just talking to 
them, that means you have no legitimate interest in actually keeping a 
friendship 



[23:15] <darksydephil> they knew what they were doing, that video 100% 
severed them from me and my content, which is obviously what they wanted: 
to stop being bothered/pestered by fans asking why they weren't doing 
shit with me 

[23:16] <plizzat5> when the ps4 launched the.co op was hilarious 
[23:16] <nightbot> Plizzat5 -> Please don't post links, [warning] 

[23:17] <ass_blastor> In their video, John mentions that if ever you felt 
like talking to him again, he would listen 

[23:18] <kodykarls> Not only that, but John lowkey dissed you with that 

Patreon parody video 

[23:18] <kodykarls> It's pretty sad 

[23:18] <plizzat5> I didn't post a link lol 

[23:19] <kodykarls> That's what happens when people stop doing something 
for the love of doing it 
[23:19] <plizzat5> thanks bot 

[23:19] <kodykarls> Howard wasn't involved AS much 

[23:19] <darksydephil> Ass_Blastor : that's what you call "covering 
yourself" as in, acting like there was an open door. He says "the lines 
are open" bug IGNORED me for a year straight, so obviously there were no 
open lines. Again, I had messaged him a dozen times and gotten no 
responses. There was no open line of dialogue, he'd blatantly ignored me 
on purpose 

[23:19] <kodykarls> But I'm surprised he still got pretty angry 
[23:20] <darksydephil> and yeah, John made that Patreon parody video at 
the same time he was totally ignoring me 

[23:20] <darksydephil> so he was insulting me before he'd even revealed 
something wsa wrong to anybody 
[23:21] <plizzat5> shit got real 

[23:21] <darksydephil> Straight up, Howard got mad be he thought he was 
gonna make bank off of Project 7 lol 

[23:21] <ass_blastor> John also mentioned about why he ignored you. He 
said he went out of town doing some camping or some shit. But I totally 
understand that they were out of line making that video about you. 

[23:21] <darksydephil> Ass_Blastor he ignored me for almost a year? that 
was a long camping trip haha 

[23:22] <ass_blastor> You guys made some of the best playthrough 
commentaries though. I still go back to watch your guy's stuff 
[23:22] <plizzat5> when ps4 slash xbox one stuff was hilarious 
[23:23] <gutty333> did John ever get a cut when he did co-op with you? 
[23:23] <darksydephil> I know. It really is a shame it ended, be TONS of 
game are full online co-op now. It would have been an amazing opportunity 
to continue doing what we were doing, even with Smark Guys which could 
have continued over an online podcast. But that was John's choice 
[23:23] <darksydephil> Gutty: John got a cut since the week he lost his 
job at Gamestop in 2011 up until the final session he ever did with me. 
That was 3 straight years of weekly paychecks 
[23:23] <kodykarls> RIP Red Dead Redemption 2 Suicide Kings 
[23:23] <darksydephil> and I always paid him half of whatever i made on 
the vids, right down the middle 

[23:24] <gutty333> half of videos he was involved in ? 

[23:24] <gutty333> if that is true, than that was nice of you 
[23:24] <darksydephil> then later on when it became impossible tos ee how 
much i made on the vids because reporting was fucked up, we agreed upon a 



set amount per visit and he was the one who asked for that amount, and i 
immediately agreed 

[23:25] <darksydephil> i also paid his way for most if not all the trips 
we went on, including plane tickets, hotel and food 

[23:25] <kodykarls> That's true, an online podcast was totally do-able, 
he's done it with OJ for years now 

[23:25] <ass_blastor> I think you guys had great potential, could have 
even started a new channel just for co-op playthroughs with John and 
given a cut from him. Hope you guys can make peace one day. 

[23:25] <darksydephil> so how on earth that guy could ever complain a 
lick about me, i dunno. I never said a negative word about him and still 
haven't, i still feel totally blindsided and just stupefied about the 
whole thing 

[23:26] <gutty333> so clearly the dilemma here is the patron debacle? 
Don't know the full story but it seems project 7 got funded, but the 
money was not used and kept instead? 

[23:26] <darksydephil> John knows how bad that video hurt me and has made 
zero effort to ever contact me, talk about it or apologize, so yeah, 
there won't be any peace be it's on him to fix stuff 
[23:26] <darksydephil> gutty what?!? 

[23:26] <darksydephil> that has nothing whatsoever to do with john or 
howard lol 

[23:26] <plizzat5> I never saw this video 
[23:27] <darksydephil> that was years later 

[23:27] <kodykarls> @Gutty333 That was for a reboot w/o John 

[23:27] <gutty333> something had to be an issue or are you guys socially 

awkward to just stop being friends for no reason? 

[23:28] <darksydephil> if you want my honest opinion, and this is total 
speculation 

[23:28] <kodykarls> I think it's more of Phil tried to continue being his 
friend, and John refuses 

[23:29] <gutty333> @KodyKarls that makes no sense, if John could had 
continue to benefit from Phil, there is more to this I think. Could it be 
the move to Washington ? 

[23:29] <plizzat5> had no idea john made a dsp diss video 
[23:29] <kodykarls> That's the thing, the move to Washington was an 
opportunity for John to speak up, while Phil was on the other side of the 
country 

[23:30] <darksydephil> i mean just listen to what he says in that video 
[23:31] <darksydephil> stuff like "Everything is shared and online" and 
the like. It seems like he wanted a disconnect, a friendship with me that 
was completely outside of the realm of what we put on camera, in addition 
to what we did 

[23:31] <darksydephil> what John didn't realize is that the entire rest 
of my life was filming my solo stuff, it wasn't like I had massive free 
time and was just hanging out with other friends. I was full-on in 
YouTube mode to make money when the money was great. But John took 
resentment from that 

[23:31] <kodykarls> That would mean double the time spent, which I don't 
think was possible 

[23:32] <gutty333> so in other words you were just a business partner to 
him? 



[23:32] <darksydephil> in a lot of ways, the YouTube life hurt a ton of 
shit. My friendships with John and Howard, and my relationship with 
Leanna. it's a rough life for sure 

[23:32] <ass_blastor> Phil, I think it would help you to make some new 
friends. You don't have to involve them in your online life but, outside 
of it. Not sure if you are doing this. This will ease the stresses in 
your life 

[23:33] <darksydephil> no see Gutty, to HIM I think that's how he felt. 
That's not how I felt at all. I saw it as a friend is coming over to 
chill and have fun, and FUCK, we're lucky enouhg to make money while we 
do it too! 

[23:33] <darksydephil> even i didn't have youtube i would have wanted him 
to come over and hang every week, but i dont think he felt that way, he 
just thought it was for the money 

[23:33] <gutty333> yeah that's what I meant, he just viewed the whole 
interaction as a business collaboration. 

[23:34] <plizzat5> for Xmas phil play how the saints stole xmas die from 
00 

[23:34] <darksydephil> at first i dont think he saw it like that either 
as i wasn't paying him, but as soon as i started making money and paying 
him, i do think his attitude changed 

[23:36] <darksydephil> I'll also be totally honest here, I think John 
resented the fact that my YouTube stuff did well and his didn't do nearly 
as well. He clearly thought the stuff he put out on his channel was 
better than just the gameplay on mine, but he barely ever made any money 
on it despite the tons of hard work that was put forth to create it 
[23:36] <gutty333> is still awkward honestly, like if I just have 
interaction with someone were we share a single interest that still 
builds a friendship bound. I mean like going to trips and hanging out 
together has to mean something. 

[23:36] <kodykarls> He should have been grateful for the increase in 
views/subs his channel brought when you made it with him 
[23:36] <darksydephil> so it's hard to not start resenting someone when 
they are making bank doing something you view as lower quality/easier 
than what you're doing, but what you're doing isn't getting popular 
[23:37] <kodykarls> Like, if it wasn't for you, I don't think his channel 
would have been that successful 

[23:37] <darksydephil> look at John's early stuff: gameplay. It blew up 
huge, he was getting tons of views. He told me he didn't want to do it 
anymore but instead start podcasts and series, and those didn't take off 
like the gameplay 

[23:37] <darksydephil> and hell, don't get started on Holepunch which he 
worked his ass off on for over a year and it got next to no attention 
[23:37] <darksydephil> even with promotion at conventions that we went to 
[23:38] <gutty333> between friends to have that mindset is just jealousy 
honestly, I have friends that have had an easier road compared to mine 
and why would I hate on that. 

[23:38] <ass_blastor> I watched some of the stuff. I think the issue with 
the skits is the that they are too long 

[23:38] <kodykarls> It doesn't matter how long a skit is, but it's more 
about the message that comes with it 

[23:39] <ass_blastor> the length does matter. Look at guild wars skit. It 
was short and sweet. Had good story 



[23:39] <kodykarls> Kind of fucked up they made that video on (or around) 
Thanksgiving, too 

[23:40] <ass_blastor> If you watch a skit with 2 guys for 20 mins - 30 
mins, that's too drawn out 

[23:40] <kodykarls> Especially since they usually did the Black Friday 
podcast episode together, too 

[23:40] <miraimisaki> I think him driving for over 2 hours back and forth 
to your house made it very clear that it was all about the money 
[23:40] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil you ever though of doing anime reaction 
videos? Attack on Titan season 3 is coming out early next year. I have 
seen small youtube channels take advantage of the craze and audience say 
like watching season 1 and 2 and have grown massively. There is a big 
crowd there, also sponsor opportunity with crunchyroll and what not. Give 
it a thouhg 

[23:40] <plizzat5> thank god for twitch for paving the way 
[23:41] <darksydephil> reaction videos are not only completely worthless 
tripe, they get demonetized, i have to focus on streaming and gameplay 
related projects, nothing that's going to be heavily edited and then just 
demonetized on a whim by youtube 

[23:42] <gutty333> the crowd is there and some are seeing huge success. 
[23:43] <kodykarls> Unless you had a backing that a YouTube Red show has, 
it's hard to be profitable from stuff like that 
[23:43] <infinite_55> Agreed. Avoid needless headaches. 

[23:44] <gutty333> @KodyKarls trust me, is more about personality in this 
category than set up or edits. I seen a small youtube than was once they 
started doing shows like one punch and attack on titan they exploded 
[23:44] <darksydephil> thats why i'm done with edited reviews and the 
like, it really sucks, but look at how well things are doing with 
streams. Twitch is where it's at right now, i'd be completely nuts to 
focus on a YouTube edited series at this point 
[23:44] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Can I ask you a question? 

[23:44] <kodykarls> There's a market for reaction videos, yeah, I never 
said there wasn't, but I don't think Phil is gonna pull in that same 
audience 

[23:45] <darksydephil> sure infinite 

[23:46] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Ever since I started cheering for you 
and tipping you, I've received a lot of hate mail from other twitch 
users. Is this normal and something I'll just have to get used to? 

[23:46] <infinite_55> Didn't want to bring it up on stream and derail the 
chat 

[23:46] <darksydephil> yes it is 
[23:46] <darksydephil> its the morons 

[23:47] <gutty333> detractor army it will never die just being honest 
[23:47] <darksydephil> they've tried every possible thing to tear me down 
and none of it has worked, so now they attack people who support me 
[23:47] <infinite_55> Kk, I'll just ignore them, but wow they can be very 
hurtful. 

[23:48] <infinite_55> One of them even threated me:( 

[23:48] <darksydephil> when SWATing, DDOS attacks, mass slander and hate, 
TIHYDP, false reports to youtube, twitch and anyone i try to work with 
business-wise, reporting me for tax evasion/fraud, signing me up for mass 
amounts of physical junkmail AND junk e-mail to my public internet 
addresses all fail, they have to try something else, so they attack the 
fans 



[23:48] <darksydephil> its been happening on Twitter for years 
[23:48] <darksydephil> only recently has it come over to Twitch since now 
people cheer/sub/tip etc 

[23:48] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil do you ever see yourself doing a 24 
hours stream? What are the chances of that ever happening ? 

[23:48] <darksydephil> if you get threatened, immediately report it to 
twitch 

[23:49] <kodykarls> 24 hour streams are intense, I almost passed out 
around hour 22 

[23:49] <plizzat5> @gutty333 lol 

[23:49] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Okay I will. How do you put up with 
all that negativity? It would drive me nuts. 

[23:49] <darksydephil> a 24 hour stream would be insanely bad for me 
[23:49] <darksydephil> i already live a sedentary livestyle 
[23:49] <gutty333> if you are a twitch streamer you have to do it just 
once. I mean come on YOLO 

[23:49] <darksydephil> now imagine barely moving for 24 hours, id get a 
blood clot 

[23:50] <darksydephil> i would actually have to start working out for 
like 3 months prior to attempting any really lengthy stream 
[23:50] <kodykarls> Your voice would be gone for weeks LUL 
[23:50] <infinite_55> If you move around every 2/3 hours, you can avoid a 
clot, but I think your voice would give out before that happened 
[23:50] <kekon3> I can barely do 19 hours and I'm supposed to be at my 
prime of my youth 

[23:50] <darksydephil> my voice is shot as it is, no lie 
[23:51] <kekon3> it takes a lot of energy 

[23:51] <darksydephil> i really need this break this week 
[23:51] <darksydephil> talking 5-9 hours a day kills the throat, its not 
normal human behavior 

[23:51] <gutty333> I think it just needs to be well planned, but lets be 
honest it is quite an experience. It think it would be cool on the resume 
LOL 

[23:52] <plizzat5> Redbull gives you wings 

[23:52] <darksydephil> if i ever did a crazy long stream it would 
probably be for charity, at least it would be worth it then 
[23:52] <darksydephil> but sadly i always find myself in fucked 
situations wehre i can't even do charity be my own finances are so fucked 
[23:52] <kodykarls> "Did a 24 hour Twitch stream" that's not something 
you really put on a resume, unless you're trying to get a job at Twitch 
[23:52] <darksydephil> i honestly still cannot believe the current tax 
situation, i paid a guy thousands of bucks to make sure my shit was 
straight for years only to find he fucked me. unbelieveable 
[23:53] <gutty333> 24 hours can aid you financially tremendously . Ad, 
plus support , plus bigger window for new comers 

[23:53] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Presumably you cant sue the guy 
right? 

[23:53] <kodykarls> He didn't do the basic research, I almost wonder if 
he actually did know a little something, and just never said anything 
[23:53] <miraimisaki> anything for $$ right? 

[23:54] <plizzat5> accountants make bank 

[23:54] <darksydephil> theres no point to suing the guy, i can only sue 
for the fees/penalties and interest which at most will probably only be a 
few thousand, just filing the lawsuit is more expensive lol 



[23:54] <darksydephil> it would be one thing if i were rich and doing it 
on principle, but that's not the case here 

[23:55] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Yeah I hear you. I had a similar 
problem years ago. 

[23:55] <kodykarls> The fact that he even agreed to continue working for 
you shows how shady he is 

[23:55] <ass_blastor> Is January the month when you find out how much you 
owe? 

[23:55] <infinite_55> A 

[23:55] <kodykarls> Probably just desperate for clients FailFish 
[23:55] <miraimisaki> define rich lol ppl could say you living in a big 
house is rich 

[23:55] <darksydephil> yeah, the guy should have immediately just said 
"get a tax attorney in Washington" when i asked him in 2014. that was 
totally fucked up that he told me not to 

[23:56] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil seriously question here, do you really 
not have any back up savings or don't do any investing on the side? 
[23:56] <darksydephil> MiraiMisaki : wealth isn't defined as how much you 
make, it's defined as how much you keep, i keep nothing, therefore, i'm 
poor lol 

[23:56] <darksydephil> i had backup savings, they all went bye bye over 
2015-2016 when my youtube income decreased by 66% 

[23:56] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil what about any investing? 

[23:57] <darksydephil> it wasn't until this year when twitch became a 
major moneymaking factor that i stopped "bleeding out" per say 
[23:57] <darksydephil> i never had any money to invest, any money i had 
was saved up for like 1-2 years and then i moved here, spending it all 
[23:57] <miraimisaki> it wasn't street smart of you to have just taken 
his word for it tho.If you had been a little more prudent in your 
spending this unfortunate situation might have never existed. 

[23:58] <gutty333> @DarksydePhil asking because for you as a self 
employed what retirement options are there? Is is social security or are 
you guys under certain programs? 

[23:58] <darksydephil> MiraiMisaki : hindsight is 20/20. When i moved in 
2014 I was making way more money, and if things had stayed at that level 
I never would have even needed to get a Patreon. Look how shit on YouTUbe 
has totally collapsed since then, nobody knew that would happen 
[23:58] <kodykarls> Isn't the retirement age, like, 65? 

[23:58] <darksydephil> I love how when im in immediate financial crisis, 
people start asking about retirement lol 

[23:58] <ass_blastor> the state tax in Washington is 6.5%. Let's say you 
100,000 each year (hypothetical). That is 6500 each year in tax. 19500 in 
total for 3 years. If you made 60k on average, that 11700 for 3 years. So 
probably over 10k in back taxes 

[23:59] <darksydephil> let me tell you something: if you have the 
opportunity to plan on retirement, you're incredibly lucky and should be 
counting your blessings 

[23:59] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Would you ever consider finding a 
smaller place in Washington, or is that not feasible? I'm from Canada so 
I'm not really in the know regarding US housing. 

[23:59] <kodykarls> They probably think it's an immediate solution lmao 
Session Time: Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 2017 

[00:00] <kodykarls> Plus, it's not like Phil has a boss 



[00:00] <gutty333> SKodyKarls yes but by that age you honestly don't want 
to be doing grueling work. No reason I asked is because to understand the 
severity of the problem and to let Phil know that even if is just saving 
50 - 200 USD each month can lead to some capital. 

[00:00] <darksydephil> moving in any way, shape or form would be 
incredibly difficult, i live alone, how do i pack up an entire house? 
sell all the shit that can't be moved? i'd have to somehow figure out all 
of that stuff by myself WHILE still streaming full time, i can barely 
just do the streaming now 

[00:00] <kodykarls> Maybe at his old job he would have a retirement plan, 
but not with YouTube 

[00:01] <darksydephil> okay im out of here, time to watch RAW and unwind 
a bit 

[00:01] <gutty333> The whole saying that you need massive amount of money 
to invest is false to some extent, sure you wont make life changes money 
right away with just $50 per month investing,but it adds up. Compound 
interest is real and is a massive life changer 

[00:01] <kodykarls> Alright, have a great night, Phil, good luck with 
everything, keep on fighting! 

[00:02] <miraimisaki> @Gutty333 find me a bank which has compound 
interest 

[00:02] <gutty333> i said investing 

[00:02] <gutty333> did not say putting in savings account 
[00:02] <plizzat5> later 

[00:02] <infinite_55> @DarksydePhil Alright peace cheerlOO 
[00:03] <infinite_55> See you guys later! 

[00:03] <ass_blastor> Did Phil say the tax situation is for 3 years of 
state tax or just 1? 

[00:03] <kodykarls> See ya. Infinite! 

[00:03] <kodykarls> 3 years, he hasn't paid any business tax in all of 
the years he's been there 

[00:04] <ass_blastor> that blows, that means he probably easily owes over 
10K in back taxes. The Jan patreon will probably not cover it. He'll have 
to do payments 

[00:05] <miraimisaki> I don't understand why he cant get a small loan 
from his parents. If his parents don't even have 10K in savings to lend 
out to him, I don't see how they can ever retire. 

[00:05] <ass_blastor> Lending money from parents is not right, you can't 
expect them to bail him out 

[00:06] <gutty333> he does not have to pay 10k up front, is maybe going 
to be like $200-700 per month 

[00:06] <miraimisaki> in this situation, it makes sense, another thing 
that would also make sense is to sell the unused unrented condo back in 
CT 

[00:07] <plizzat5> he didn't well that yet? lmao 
[00:07] <plizzat5> sell 

[00:07] <gutty333> yeah seriously the whole point of real state is to 
make a profit, rent that man cave LOL 

[00:07] <ass_blastor> I wouldn't expect my parents or friends to bail me 
out. I think he will be fine after he hires a tax attorney in Washington 
and get this resolved 

[00:08] <miraimisaki> Phil had years before this tax issue arose to get 
at least some monthly income. Which is why the haters making phil look 
bad isn't completely made up 



[00:08] <miraimisaki> from rent 

[00:08] <plizzat5> idk all this tax talk is the IRS coming after him? 
[00:08] <gutty333> I think someone said it best, the situation is 
honestly not that big of deal as he makes it out, I think he just nervous 
about it. Mostly is just lk to the assistant and like $300 monthly 
payments 

[00:08] <ass_blastor> I think he has a lot of equity, if he is in a tight 
spot, there are plenty of things he can do to fix the issue 
[00:09] <miraimisaki> I think phil is exaggerating as usual, whatever, it 
isn't something new 

[00:09] <ass_blastor> That's right Gutty, I think he will be fine. 

[00:09] <ass_blastor> oh well, let's leave it so he can get it figured 
out 

[00:10] <plizzat5> phil is phucked 

[00:11] <gutty333> if issues like this keep happening though this 
lifestyle can't be sustained honestly. If it really is a case of living 
paycheck to paycheck. Who is not to say the next consoles will cost $700 
and games jump to $70 . Another obstacle being thrown his way. I mean 
really change needs to happen you can be static and hope to ride the 
waves 

[00:12] <gutty333> can't be* 

[00:12] <miraimisaki> nah but he is really using this backtax issue as 
his new crisis to make drama to get sympathy, seems dishonest to me since 
he can have various ways to solve the need of 10K for backtaxes 
[00:13] <gutty333> well if he is living paycheck to paycheck he does need 
to extra money, the point being made is that is not as serious as it is 
being presented. It can be manageable . 

[00:14] <gutty333> he' 11 be fine i mean that other day i think he 
pocketed like 4k 

[00:15] <ass_blastor> Well, we have to take everything at face value what 

Phil says. It's hard to do that for me. I need proof for everything 

[00:16] <plizzat5> hopefully twitch will pull phil out of this bs 

[00:16] <ass_blastor> twitch is already doing that 

[00:25] <plizzat5> thx gawd 

[00:29] <plizzat5> anyone still here 

[00:31] <kodykarls> I am 

[00:32] <plizzat5> yo 

[00:32] <kodykarls> Eyyyy 

[00:33] <plizzat5> what country slash state u in 
[00:33] <kodykarls> USA, Kenosha, WI 
[00:34] <plizzat5> Wisconsin? 

[00:34] <kodykarls> Yeah, but it's like 30-45 min away from Chicago 
[00:35] <plizzat5> gotta be cold 
[00:35] <plizzat5> I'm in az 

[00:35] <kodykarls> Yeah, it is lol, and I deliver in it 
[00:36] <kodykarls> Arizona sounds like a cool state 
[00:36] <plizzat5> ur probably in the coldest part of us 
[00:36] <plizzat5> it's not bad just hot. 

[00:36] <kodykarls> Yeah, up north is ridiculously cold 
[00:37] <kodykarls> Do you guys get snow? 

[00:37] <kodykarls> I know Texas rarely does 
[00:38] <plizzat5> yes in northern az 
[00:38] <plizzat5> rarely where I am 

[00:40] <plizzat5> your high was 36 today that's insane 



[00:40] <kodykarls> Yeah, it should be dropping further pretty soon 
[00:40] <kodykarls> We're usually in the negative by December 
[00:41] <kodykarls> This year is actually not as bad so far lol 
[00:41] <plizzat5> do people drop dead on a daily basis ) 

[00:42] <plizzat5> seems waaay too cold 

[00:42] <kodykarls> I don't know about dropping dead, but I know you can 
get frost bite easily, which isn't fun, my fingers are still numb from 
the other night, and I was only outside for less than 2 minutes 
[00:43] <plizzat5> holy cow 

[00:45] <kodykarls> Yeah, and the summer can get pretty hot, probably not 
as hot as you guys, but we really get the most extreme weather all year 
long 

[00:46] <plizzat5> never seen the great lakes 
[00:46] <plizzat5> am I missing any thing 

[00:47] <kodykarls> I'm near Lake Michigan, so that's about the most of 
what I've seen 

[00:47] <kodykarls> I haven't traveled much, yet, but I plan on it 
[00:47] <kodykarls> Probably when I look for a place to move to 
[00:47] <kodykarls> But you're not missing much from here, at least 
[00:48] <plizzat5> ya you have a lot of major cities around u 
[00:48] <plizzat5> ha 

[00:49] <kodykarls> Yeah, Chicago was a fairly common field trip when I 
was in school 

[00:50] <plizzat5> Cleveland seems like a cool city 
[00:52] <kodykarls> He's also a cool character in Family Guy lol 
[00:53] <kodykarls> There's some cool places to visit, good area for 
tourists 

[00:55] <plizzat5> lol
