[11:22] <darksydephil> wassap 

[11:22] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[11:28] <darksydephil> testing 

[11:28] <darksydephil> test 

[11:28] <darksydephil> can you guys see this? 

[11:28] <darksydephil> ok cool 
[11:41] <darksydephil> sup all 
[11:41] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[11:41] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet it out 

[11:42] <darksydephil> well SFV was functionally fucked up because of input delay 
[11:43] <darksydephil> MvC Infinite is just broken by design to be flashy 
[11:43] <darksydephil> so i’d say at launch they were equally shit 

[11:43] <darksydephil> if the input delay isn't as much of a factor anymore then SFV is probably better, but i 
won't ever know 

[11:45] <darksydephil> yes theycallmejimbob thats the one i played most in the 90s really, for 2 straight years 
[11:45] <darksydephil> its crap, nowhere near as good as the arcade versino but its all that was around back then 
so we played it and loved it

[11:13] <darksydephil> hell 

[11:13] <darksydephil> oops 

[11:13] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:13] <darksydephil> yup 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i barely use steam, so nope 

[11:26] <darksydephil> because Mario is Mario, but i'm gonna be juggling all 3 at once for a while until I see 
what has the most interest 

[11:26] <darksydephil> and which ones i like the best 

[11:27] <darksydephil> reggarz 

[11:27] <darksydephil> warning 

[11:27] <darksydephil> your fanboyism is showing 

[11:27] <darksydephil> zip your fly! 

[11:27] <darksydephil> we can all see it! Push it back into your pants 
[11:27] <darksydephil> before the camera is still on 
[11:30] <darksydephil> ive heard this runs like shit on ps4 

[11:31] <darksydephil> which is hilarious since its not graphically intensive at all 
[11:31] <darksydephil> oops i had the wrong thing muted 
[11:36] <darksydephil> okay, is the stream working? 

[11:37] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet this out 

[11:40] <darksydephil> this game isn't realistic, it's cartoony. they use huge mallets and stuff on each other, if it 
were hyper realistic, like if we were scheduled to play Counter STrike, then yeah i wouldn’t be playing that today 
[11:41] <darksydephil> i wonder if they’ll sell a single copy of the paid version of their game with this free 
Battle Royale mode, i doubt it lol, most people are only playing it be its free

[11:46] <darksydephil> to be fair 
[11:46] <darksydephil> its not the game 
[11:46] <darksydephil> its the emulator

[12:22] <darksydephil> wassap 

[12:29] <darksydephil> currently a video game character costume is WAY in the lead for the halloween marathon 











[12:29] <darksydephil> which is good be i saw 2 really good ones im interested in getting 

[12:34] <darksydephil> people want constant jokes, violence or rage. How DARE there be plot development in a 

modern vidya game?!? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> im good, looking forward to returning to a crazy 2 months of constant game streaming 
[12:36] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the restroom and then start! 

[12:40] <darksydephil> yeah, i hate to say it, but that battlefront 2 beta was boring as shit 

[12:41] <darksydephil> how they've managed to totally elude the fun feeling of the original battlefront games in 
2 instalments now is pretty amazing lol 

[12:42] <darksydephil> i got battlefront 1 for free 2 years ago and i feel like i was ripped off 

[12:43] <darksydephil> wrong, in the original games if a hero appears, you run to a vehicle or turret and blast em 

[12:43] <darksydephil> i remember, vehicles were OP 

[12:43] <darksydephil> 8v8 on shitty maps with awful choke points 

[12:44] <darksydephil> at least that map in the beta is shit 

[12:44] <darksydephil> SPOILER: HAN SOLO DIES in the Last Jedi!!!

[20:15] <darksydephil> wassap 

[20:19] <darksydephil> there will be new stream alerts starting tonight and they are excellent dspSexy 
[20:21] <darksydephil> i believe i did like it but i also criticized it for its few flaws 
[20:24] <darksydephil> im not even sure which ones aren’t public yet lol 
[20:25] <darksydephil> i played the strider on ps4 

[20:25] <darksydephil> elipsion if you could email me at darksydephil@hotmail.com with the 3DS playthroughs 

you know are still marked as private, i can look into making them public again 

[20:25] <darksydephil> right now im a bit busy 

[20:26] <darksydephil> okay time to get this show started! 

[20:26] <darksydephil> what on earth 

[20:26] <darksydephil> it just showed a cheer from goldencolts who didn’t just cheer lol 
[20:27] <darksydephil> okay stream should be going live now 
[20:27] <darksydephil> brb im gonna grab a seltzer water for this! 

[20:31] <darksydephil> no, apparently the "article" from a "journalist" stating that you have to pay to see the real 
ending without grinding endlessly was false, it was just a dumbfuck whiny idiot who wanted to slam the game 
for having lootboxes instead of actually being truthful, sigh. 

[20:32] <darksydephil> the best way to eliminate microtransactions in video games is to not buy them yourself, 
period, i dunno why so many whiny babies are going nuts on the internet about them, if you dont buy them, they 
dont have any effect on you 
[20:32] <darksydephil> wassap 

[20:33] <darksydephil> that would make sense, if you’re dumping hundreds of hours into a game that's free, and 
you spend some money on the game to actually pay back the game devs, then nothing is wrong, the problem is 
these fools spend thousands of bucks lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171010-01 ME SHADOW OF WAR 2ND.LOG 

[12:31] <darksydephil> wassap everyone 

[12:32] <darksydephil> not really, i know some of their music 

[12:35] <darksydephil> there we go 

[12:36] <darksydephil> ps4 has this weird issue 

[12:36] <darksydephil> if you suspend the system when a game is still running the audio mutes 
[12:36] <darksydephil> you have to close the game to get the audio back 
[12:37] <darksydephil> so do you guys like the game so far? 

[12:37] <darksydephil> im looking forward to getting revenge for the death by that captain and then moving the 
story today 

[12:38] <darksydephil> btw stream is working right? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet it out 





-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171010-02 ME SHADOW OF WAR 3RD.LOG 

[19:30] <darksydephil> wassap

[19:37] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:37] <darksydephil> ready for more shadow of war? i'm about to fight the nazgul 
[19:41] <darksydephil> LOL well guess what 

[19:41] <darksydephil> my vlogging channel is now getting hit with demonetization 
[19:41] <darksydephil> the latest week in preview was demonetized 
[19:41] <darksydephil> i have to see if EVERY video i upload gets demonetized htere now 
[19:42] <darksydephil> if so it means that series like DSP Tries It are dead 
[19:44] <darksydephil> okay stream iis working for everyone? 

[19:44] <darksydephil> cool ill tweet it out 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171011-01 ME SHADOW OF WAR4TH.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> wassap everybody 
[12:29] <darksydephil> about to get started 

[12:29] <darksydephil> um most reviewers are saying the game is good 

[12:30] <darksydephil> what you're hearing is the massive drama created by youtubers to get views 

[12:30] <darksydephil> user reviews are based on that drama, those idiots didnt even play the game, they're just 

bitching about lootboxes 

[12:30] <darksydephil> its a more streamlined, faster paced shadow of mordor honestly 
[12:30] <darksydephil> you get far more great abilities from the get go 
[12:31] <darksydephil> if anything so far its too easy and im 8 hours in 

[12:31] <darksydephil> yeah they casualized it be people complained the first game was too difficult and too 
much of a grind with the stealth and whatnot 

[12:31] <darksydephil> so now the stealth is still there but you dont even really have to use it 
[12:35] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> okay cool ill tweet it out 

[12:38] <darksydephil> Mark Zuckerberg announces the Oculus Go for $199, only two years too late for 

anybody to care lol 

[12:38] <darksydephil> what an idiot 

[12:40] <darksydephil> VR is a gimmick that was hyped 2 years ago, got mainstream released with teh Oculus, 
VIVE and PSVR, and now nobody cares anymore 

[12:40] <darksydephil> Zuckerberg is literally 2 years too late for this thing to matter 
[12:42] <darksydephil> VR games have been incredibly underwhelming, disorienting and underselling 
[12:42] <darksydephil> the fad is dead, nobody is giong to develop major games for VR after the flop last year 
[12:43] <darksydephil> theres no reason to trade in the psvr, its not worth anything lol 
[12:43] <darksydephil> id probably get like $90 store credit 

[12:44] <darksydephil> theres the Inpatient from the makers of Until Dawn. And DOOM VR looks good 
[12:45] <darksydephil> outside of those, yeah, the PSVR is probably a paperweight 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171012-01 ME SHADOW OF WAR 5TH.LOG 

[12:35] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:36] <darksydephil> hows everyone? ready for a crazy fun new day of new release hype?

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay folks, is the stream working? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> great thanks all, ill tweet it out and grab some drinks 
[12:48] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171013-01 EVIL WITHIN 2 2ND.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:29] <darksydephil> the stream shall start in just a moment 
[12:34] <darksydephil> okay, stream is working? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> sweet i’ll tweet it out 

[12:37] <darksydephil> OK everyone, be right back, grabbing drinks for the stream! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171013-02 EVIL WITHIN 2 3RD.LOG 

[19:30] <darksydephil> what on earth is giong on in here 

[19:30] <darksydephil> i leave for a couple of hours, i come back, theres a ton of cheers and discussion about 
random stuff 

[19:30] <darksydephil> unacceptable! 

[19:31] <darksydephil> you should all be lashing your own backs in penance for your sins during stream breaks, 
there’s no time like the present! 

[19:31] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:32] <darksydephil> in all seriousness, im finishing up with the first batch of videos and then ill start the next 
stream 

[19:32] <darksydephil> adding the thumbnails now 

[19:37] <darksydephil> hmm goldencults not sure why, it must be something to do with the extension possibly 
not picking up during an outage similar to muxy not picking stuff up sometimes 
[19:38] <darksydephil> sooo apparently 

[19:39] <darksydephil> the dashboard doesn’t show up when im hosting? 

[19:39] <darksydephil> thats odd 

[19:39] <darksydephil> okay im gonna start up my stream 

[19:41] <darksydephil> ok brb gonna use the restroom 

[19:52] <darksydephil> okay are we good? stream working for everyone? 

[19:52] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live and we’ll get ready to go here 
[22:17] <darksydephil> um, i haven't had an inflammation issue in over 2 years lol 
[22:17] <darksydephil> you may be just a little late to the party on that one 

[22:20] <darksydephil> i dont drink the typical energy drinks, i drink V8 which has low carbs, low sodium and is 
green tea based plus real fruit and vegetable juice, i did my homework, im not drinking monster o rred bull lol 
[22:21] <darksydephil> not their energy drink, you're thinking V8 standard drink which is extremely salty 
[22:22] <darksydephil> um, if their nutrition facts are wrong they can go to jail lol 

[22:22] <darksydephil> their energy drinks are NOT salty, they are sweet actually but low in carbs be its using 
the natural flavors of the fruit in them 

[22:22] <darksydephil> i used to drink shit like Jolt Cola, THAT was awful for me 

[22:23] <darksydephil> i dont take in sugar outside of hte V8 and the blueberry juice i drink at dinner, i dont 
snack at all 

[22:23] <darksydephil> no sweets at all actually 

[22:24] <darksydephil> diet cola is worse for you than regular cola lol 

[22:26] <darksydephil> aspartame can’t be used by the body for anything useful, actual sugar can be. thats why 
real cola is better than diet 

[22:26] <darksydephil> just drink in moderation and you're fine, the problem is these idiots who drink like 10 
cans of soda a day 

[22:28] <darksydephil> lol you make no sense 






[22:28] <darksydephil> why are you ingesting something just to pass through you? you're supposed to be eating 
and drinking for sustenance, not pleasure 

[22:28] <darksydephil> i NEVER eat or drink unless i'm hungry or thirsty, never, i dont get cravings 
[22:30] <darksydephil> i only eat for sustenance lol. im not lying, i have no real snacks in the house at all 
[22:30] <darksydephil> i eat twice a day, once a major meal and once a light meal, i drink when i'm thirsty 
[22:30] <darksydephil> thats it 

[22:30] <darksydephil> no idea hoboXlO but the month is looking insane so far 

[22:31] <darksydephil> no. i eat for sustenance, now choosing what i'm eating for sustenance is another thing, 
but i dont eat JUST to eat, for flavor or whatever 

[22:31] <darksydephil> the reason im overweight isnt because i eat too much or snack, in reality, i eat LESS than 
most people, the problem is i live a sedentary lifestyle and dont burn as much off as most people 
[22:32] <darksydephil> i eat more now than i used to, when i lived alone in Connecticut I only ate ONCE a day 
and it was more than enough for my lifestyle, but then i moved here and my ex cooked for me all the time, so 
yeah lol. now im used to eating more which honestly isn’t good 

[22:33] <darksydephil> im not touchy, i thi nk im around 21 Olbs right now, i fluctuate a bit between 205 and 210 
depending 

[22:33] <darksydephil> and i need to lose like 15-20 lbs to be at my ideal weight which is 185 
[22:33] <darksydephil> im 5 foot 11 

[22:34] <darksydephil> i guarantee its not 2500 every day. maybe some days but most days, nope 

[22:35] <darksydephil> like i said, im not burning the calories because my job has me sitting on my ass all day 

and i dont ever go out or work out 

[22:35] <darksydephil> ill give you an example 

[22:36] <darksydephil> today i had one v8 energy drink, water, blueberry juice, a bowl of veggie soup and a 

caesar salad (the clear, not the thick dressing), adding all that up, its not 2000 calories, and thats pretty much 

what id eat in a normal day really 

[22:37] <darksydephil> that doesn’t even make sense 

[22:37] <darksydephil> it doesn’t factor in metabolism at all lol 

[22:38] <darksydephil> some days i dont feel hungry, but most of the time i do 

[22:39] <darksydephil> every human has a different metabolism lolol 

[22:39] <darksydephil> dude you believe your arbitrary numbers science and have a good life, im over here in 
reality haha 

[22:40] <darksydephil> when i only ate one major meal a day in CT, i was around 190 pounds, be im not active, 
i didnt need anything more than that, now i eat around two meals and im overweight, this isn’t rocket science 
[22:40] <darksydephil> the reason i had inflammation was becuase i was an idiot eating red meat ALL the time, 
steaks, meatballs, burgers etc. 

[22:41] <darksydephil> plus i drank a lot. so now i barely eat red meat, mostly chicken/pork/turkey if i eat any, i 
drink way less, and i drink blueberry juice/eat acid reducing fruits often, and now im good, no inflammation 
[22:42] <darksydephil> and by the way, most lunchmeat has completely done away with nitrates FYI. 

[22:42] <darksydephil> only the lowest quality shit still has it 
[22:42] <darksydephil> oh my god 
[22:42] <darksydephil> lol 

[22:42] <darksydephil> dude, you have convinced yourself so much of so many falsehoods, it's quite fascinating. 

[22:44] <darksydephil> what on earth are you talking about 

[22:44] <darksydephil> i just said, i dont eat red meat 

[22:44] <darksydephil> well, maybe once a week if that 

[22:44] <darksydephil> i purposely cut it out of my diet 

[22:44] <darksydephil> on what planet is all lunch meat red? 

[22:44] <darksydephil> maybe on mars where you live 
[22:45] <darksydephil> yes, thats what, 10% of lunchmeat? 

[22:45] <darksydephil> theres turkey, theres turkey pastrami, theres chicken, there's ham (which is red meat, i 
know), there's roast beef (red meat), there's a wide variety of lunch meats out there and i eat the non-red ones 
[22:47] <darksydephil> real pastrami yup 



[22:47] <darksydephil> i get this turkey pastrami, i actually like it a lot although it doesn't taste like the real stuff 
[22:49] <darksydephil> i stopped eating hot dogs entirely, now i get these really good Chicken sausages from 
sam's club 

[22:49] <darksydephil> WAAAAY better for you, actual real ingredients like REAL CHEESE! GARLIC! etc 
[22:50] <darksydephil> okay, ive now officially had enough of this discussion lol. it's borderline lunacy at this 
point 

[22:51] <darksydephil> don't eat dairy, dont’ eat grains, don't eat sugar, don’t eat salt, dont' eat meat, don’t eat 

fruit, don’t eat veggies, just eat dirt, okay sounds great 

[22:52] <darksydephil> there you go 

[22:52] <darksydephil> put that shit into a blender 

[22:52] <darksydephil> and then eat 2 pounds of dirty for a true balanced diet 
[22:53] <darksydephil> the stupid shit people believe is quite baffling haha 
[22:55] <darksydephil> you know what i might have some of tonight? 

[22:55] <darksydephil> DIGIORNO PIZZA! 

[22:55] <darksydephil> fuck that shit haha 

[22:56] <darksydephil> you have way more education, based on google search of 2 seconds haha 

[22:57] <darksydephil> no like i said, i had a caesar salad (the clear dressing, not the heavy shit) and a bowl of 

minestrone soup 

[22:57] <darksydephil> zero meat today so far

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171017-02 SOUTH PARK FBW 3RD.LOG 

[19:23] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:23] <darksydephil> time to get stuff going for the 2nd stream 

[19:26] <darksydephil> its a special stream where i’m demoing a new twitch extension where viewers can click 

on my stream to interact with teh actual game 

[19:36] <darksydephil> okay stream going live in a sec! 

[19:39] <darksydephil> DS2 KingJezal ? 

[19:39] <darksydephil> is the stream working all? 

[19:40] <darksydephil> oh yeah KingJezal the game has MANY flaws, and many things in it that weren't 
retained in future from software games on purpose be ther’e just dumb 

[19:40] <darksydephil> like locking on to enemies and still attackign the wrong way. or the stupid roll sucking 
shit until you upgrade ADP a ton 

[19:40] <darksydephil> and, of course, the awful bosses of which there are a lot lol 
[19:41] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[21:01] <darksydephil> hey guys, shut the hell up about negative shit, there's a game stream going on 
[21:01] <darksydephil> only warning, ill start banning if i keep seeing it 
[21:08] <darksydephil> maybe im just interested in the game? 

[21:09] <darksydephil> if someone wants to donate they can just do it and stop making a big production of it, i 
mean shit, EVERYONE does it without having to freeze my goddamn stream 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171018-01 SOUTH PARK FBW 4TH.LOG 

[12:33] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:34] <darksydephil> ready for more south park? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> then i guess i’d better start the stream! 

[12:39] <darksydephil> stream working all? 

[12:40] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet it out 

[12:41] <darksydephil> the problem was, we had some bad trolls baiting people 

[12:41] <darksydephil> "i want to donate Phil $60, what is the best method? why won't Phil directly stop playing 
his game to answer me?" Give me a fucking break lol 

[12:42] <darksydephil> so then i dont respond and the guy is like "well then, ill KEEP MY MONEY!" like a 5 

year old child, so he got banned, it was quite ridiculous 

[12:42] <darksydephil> it was just a moron looking for attention 

[12:43] <darksydephil> if people want to donate they know how and they dont have to rely on me to tell them 
how 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay folks brb, gonna grab drinks and then get started 
[17:47] <darksydephil> nothing, kozatof is just an idiot instigator 


#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171019-01 SOUTH PARK FBW 5TH.LOG 






[12:37] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:37] <darksydephil> stream starting in just a moment 

[12:38] <darksydephil> ThatAnonyBear and ratchefanl2 have been added as trial mods to help out, particularly 
on the later streams when the existing mods aren’t around allt he time 

[12:39] <darksydephil> especially since ill be doing double stream days often now that there are tons of new 
releases 

[12:39] <darksydephil> thanks to both of them for offering to help out, hopefully this will make chat better 
overall 

[12:42] <darksydephil> yes i do rely on other mods to help out our two new ones to get into the swing of things 
[12:42] <darksydephil> and i hope this will help on Sunday as well for the special event 
[12:42] <darksydephil> my hair is standing straight up today lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> zahvone it seems my conundrum is, to get one that works with everything (pc, ps4, xbox 
one etc) i need one that works with optical audio out. so i’d need one that comes with some kind of mixer etc. 
such as the latest astro a40s or this particular set of turtle beach headphones, both of which cost around $250 
which is what i was expecting 

[12:44] <darksydephil> if i get a simple pair they won't do surround sound or work with my capture setup 
[12:44] <darksydephil> i ordered a replacement cable for my current a40s 

[12:45] <darksydephil> but they are getting worn out too, i mean ive used them constantly for almost 4 years 
[12:45] <darksydephil> by the way, is the stream working? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay thanks, ill tweet it out 

[12:49] <darksydephil> okay all, brb grabbing drinks and then we’ll begin 

[17:19] <darksydephil> you get stick of truth free no matter hwo you bought it 

[17:19] <darksydephil> but i already played it 3 years ago so i wouldn’t be playing it again now

[19:37] <darksydephil> stream going live in a sec 






[19:40] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:40] <darksydephil> okay, stream working all? 

[19:41] <darksydephil> okay sweet ill tweet it out 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171021-02 ME SHADOW OF WAR 8TH FINALE & CHOICE CHAMBER 

TEST.LOG 

[19:08] <darksydephil> got an idea folks 

[19:08] <darksydephil> let's finish up act 3 of shadow of war and see what at 4 is 

[19:08] <darksydephil> if its boring as dirt, instead let's swap over and set up choice chamber for tomorrow, you 
guys can be the first to test the interactive extension 

[19:09] <darksydephil> i dont really eat breakfast though, and most fast food breakfast is god awful 

[19:15] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:15] <darksydephil> gonna start setting u pnow 

[19:23] <darksydephil> okay starting up the stream now 

[19:23] <darksydephil> enough of the mvci garbage 

[19:23] <darksydephil> MvCI, the game for players who suck at fighting games 
[19:23] <darksydephil> i dont think im ever going to play it again honestly 

[19:24] <darksydephil> at this point the game will be 100% reality stone spam and the same lockdown garbage 
online, fuck that, it's not even a fighting game anymore 

[19:26] <darksydephil> rbreezy the schedule says 7:30-8pm. I'm early, and you're stupid. 

[19:27] <darksydephil> why would i be at twitch con? 

[19:27] <darksydephil> it's the busiest gaming season of the year, i can’t take time away to be at a convention 
now 

[19:27] <darksydephil> it's bad enough i missed first stream today, but i'm finally feeling rested 
[19:28] <darksydephil> well, unlike some, the suffering of others doesn’t really make me feel any better 
[19:28] <darksydephil> some people get off on that though 

[19:29] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet that we're live and then we’ll chat a bit on stream 

[19:30] <darksydephil> FYI the stream is live, so if you're still watching the hosted stream you're probably on 

Twitch Beta, which glitches and doesn't update 

[19:31] <darksydephil> click refresh as i’m about to start talking 

[19:31] <darksydephil> hold up DimitrisNGU let me get to my setup and we can talk about it lol 
[21:12] <darksydephil> yes the game saves are still there and they auto upload to the cloud 
[21:17] <darksydephil> thats everyone fro being patient 

[21:18] <darksydephil> um, I don't "get" why everyone is shitting on the game. Shadow of War is a great game. 
One of my top pics of the year, GOTY contender, despite the act 4 vullshit 

[21:18] <darksydephil> so please, don’t spin my matter-of-fact analysis into something it isn’t. YouTubers DID 
purposely overdramaticise the issue to make money 
[21:19] <darksydephil> there was no ragequit, you buffoon 

[21:19] <darksydephil> i beat the game, act 4 is tacked on to sell lootboxes. i beat the game before i stopped 
playing 

[21:20] <darksydephil> you mean, people have major issues not seeting things as black and white 
[21:20] <darksydephil> because most people are simpletons 
[21:23] <darksydephil> okay guys im going live 

[21:23] <darksydephil> if you're on desktop or laptop you'll be able to test if this works 

[21:23] <darksydephil> also, if you sub during this game it actually sends me gizmos to help 

[21:25] <darksydephil> the detractors are too busy saying i insulted someone whose brother died, because they're 

fucking morons, they won't care about shadow of war 

[22:07] <darksydephil> adblock wont be working with twitch much longer if at all 
[22:07] <darksydephil> they finally found a way to end that shit lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171022-01 TWITCHCON CHOICE CHAMBER.LOG 

[13:06] <darksydephil> LOL here we go with the bullshit 





[13:06] <darksydephil> i'm going to say this up front 

[13:06] <darksydephil> anyone completely talking out of their asshole today can get a nice sweet ban 
[13:07] <darksydephil> nobody was banned because "their brother passed away" 

[13:09] <darksydephil> it doesn’t matter if the person in question was a troll or not. They used a supposed 
personal loss of a loved one as a way to bolster their own ego and say "I'm better than Phil because he had a bad 
day, but I lost someone and still can do stuff better than Phil!" That's gross behavior for anyone, and my reaction 
was very warranted. 

[13:09] <darksydephil> it seems there will be tons of bans today, i guess, oh well, mods are going to show up so 
it's all good 

[13:09] <darksydephil> in addition i think im going to suspend the pop up notices during teh stream 

[13:09] <darksydephil> it just makes sense, they will come back tomorrow 

[13:11] <darksydephil> uuuuh 

[13:11] <darksydephil> anyway 

[13:11] <darksydephil> im setting up now lol 

[13:13] <darksydephil> I'm still giving verbal shoutouts for contributions, i just wont have the on-screen stuff to 
avoid trollign showing up at twitchcon. pretty simple 
[13:13] <darksydephil> you did? 

[13:13] <darksydephil> i dont think i got anything 

[13:14] <darksydephil> to be honest, the pop-ups are pretty intrusive during choice chamber as well, they 
blocked the entire bottom lefthand of the gameplay 

[13:15] <darksydephil> best way to timeout/ban someone is: click on their name, this opens a window with 
options, and timeout/ban are two of them 

[13:15] <darksydephil> if you try to click the symbol you may miss 
[13:15] <darksydephil> i do all the time lol 

[13:15] <darksydephil> nah i dont care about the chat so much, i dont even know if the chat is being shown at 
the extensions booth or not. but the stream definitely 
[13:15] <darksydephil> kozatof it might be 

[13:16] <darksydephil> I recommend you resend the email altogether 
[13:16] <darksydephil> be if its in my spam folder, ill never find it 
[13:16] <darksydephil> i get about 1000 spam emails a day 

[13:17] <darksydephil> okay im going to go grab drinks/snacks for this and then we’ll get started 
[13:17] <darksydephil> the stream starts in like 10 minutes 
[13:17] <darksydephil> but the event starts at 2:30 

[13:17] <darksydephil> i want to have the stream up and working beforehand 

[13:18] <darksydephil> theshadowwarriorl 18 at the twitch extensions booth, but i have no idea where that is 
[13:18] <darksydephil> since obviously im not there 
[13:20] <darksydephil> okay brb, then we’ll get started 
[13:26] <darksydephil> okay going to start up the stream 

[13:28] <darksydephil> okay brb, gonna use the restroom wisely before we start lol 

[18:05] <darksydephil> i was never getting featured on Twitch, it was at the Extensions booth. Anyone saying 
otherwise is just stupid and made it up lol 

[18:06] <darksydephil> i said extensions booth about 20 times today 
[18:06] <darksydephil> and all week long for that matter 

[18:06] <darksydephil> supposedly i was shown at the booth in person at twitchcon. if i wasn't, it's not skin off 
my back, i did everything as i was contractually obligated to do so no worries 

[18:07] <darksydephil> my contact at Twitch that set this all up said she was going to try and take pictures of the 
booth to show that we were live 

[18:07] <darksydephil> and you would have thought that if it wasn’t working, someone would have contacted 
me. they have all my info 

[18:07] <darksydephil> so...yeah, sounds like a bunch of kids making stuff up lol 

[18:09] <darksydephil> the whole "HE DIDNT TAG" thing was pure idiocy, my stream wasn’t supposed to show 
up on featured twitchcon streams, i’m not AT THE CON so why would it? lol 



[18:09] <darksydephil> that's just the ramblings of morons trying to cause drama 

[18:10] <darksydephil> oh i see it now kozatof, i appreciate it but i’d be looking for gaming headphones so no 
thanks. 

[18:10] <darksydephil> and yes, your email was caught in my spam filter lol 
[18:11] <darksydephil> im REALLY GLAD i used a controller lol 
[18:11] <darksydephil> playing that on keyboard would have destroyed my hands 
[18:14] <darksydephil> okay now to set up back to the normal office layout lol 
[18:18] <darksydephil> hah 

[18:18] <darksydephil> someone tried to DDOS attack me during the stream 
[18:18] <darksydephil> it didn't work lol 

[18:19] <darksydephil> yeah ive finally got some safeguards in place 
[18:19] <darksydephil> FINALLy did research and talked to a real expert 

[18:19] <darksydephil> got all kinds of prevention set up now. its not full proof but its worked for a while now 
[18:20] <darksydephil> the truth is that most of the DDOS prevention tactics you need are already built into 
existing firewalls, like Windows and a regular router, you just need to understand it and i had a really intelligent 
technical guy who works for Comcast explain it to me 

[18:20] <darksydephil> it took about an hour but i got stuff in place that has worked for a while now 

[18:21] <darksydephil> there will always be morons, but these people don’t realize how much they help me. i got 

41 new subs today, half of which were trolls, and they hurt nothing at all 

[18:21] <darksydephil> so, thanks for the money, dummies lol 

[18:22] <darksydephil> i dunno what a pen test is 

[18:22] <darksydephil> but ive set it up to protect against the common style of DDOS attacks 

[18:22] <darksydephil> only 46 new follows today 

[18:22] <darksydephil> thats about average 

[18:22] <darksydephil> but thats an insane amount of new subs 

[18:23] <darksydephil> yeah it was something different, and fun

[19:37] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i dont live in downtown Seattle lol 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i live in a suburb, and i saw your idea, but as ive said a lot, we have a LOT of 
franchises/chains and not much "local" stuff here 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i wish we actually did have more local restaurants and the like 
[19:43] <darksydephil> it was remonetized in 4 hours 

[19:43] <darksydephil> all the vids on my vlogging channel are getting demonetized 

[19:44] <darksydephil> probably blacklisted due to the stupidity of youtube employees writing a bad algorithm, 
and management that refuses to admit their ineptitude. It's an SJW world 
[19:44] <darksydephil> no kidding 

[19:44] <darksydephil> its just their algorithm doesn't work, it randomly flags anything 
[19:45] <darksydephil> anyone could tell you that, but youtube doesn't care, they feel they are above reproach 
[19:46] <darksydephil> that won’t happen, im not going to film inside a restaurant on private property, many 
places wont allow it 

[19:48] <darksydephil> filming on private property without express permission is illegal in the united states, any 
restaurant would be considered private property 

[19:48] <darksydephil> just because someone does it doesn't make it legal 

[19:49] <darksydephil> ive done it before too, when on vacation sometimes, but its not legal lol 

[19:51] <darksydephil> if you film on private property anywhere without express permission of the owner of that 

property, yes, you have broken US law 

[19:51] <darksydephil> no, it's the fake DSP's twitch Kappa 

[19:51] <darksydephil> you caught me! 

[19:52] <darksydephil> do they all have over 5 million views and 46k followers? 

[19:53] <darksydephil> hah 

[19:53] <darksydephil> its pretty nuts, i still get over 1.5 million views a month on my dspgaming channel, here 
ive only gotten 5 million views in how many years? 

[19:53] <darksydephil> i streamed from early 2013 until late 2014 here so about 1.5 years then ,and another year 
now. so thats 2.5 years to hit 5 million 

[19:54] <darksydephil> if i could get those people to come over here, holy shit, that would be amazing but i 
doubt it’ll happen 

[19:54] <darksydephil> imagine how crazy it would be to have l-2k active people here every single stream 
[19:55] <darksydephil> yeah see, i dont want to become that 

[19:55] <darksydephil> i still want to be about the games even if i balance it with the shoutouts and whatnot 
[19:56] <darksydephil> this isn't a fundraising stream, it sa gameplay stream FIRST 




[19:56] <darksydephil> okay so the stream is working?

[19:35] <darksydephil> I'm hearing everyone is saying this is the worst Mario game ever, a real train wreck 
Kappa

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171029-01 MARIO ODYSSEY 2ND.LOG 

[12:31] <darksydephil> hello everyone 
[12:31] <darksydephil> question for you 

[12:32] <darksydephil> for those who watched Mario on Friday, would you prefer i keep recording/streaming at 
1080p and 30fps, or do you want me to downgrade to 720p so i can do full 60fps? 

[12:33] <darksydephil> okay i will go 60fps then 
[12:33] <darksydephil> thanks 

[12:35] <darksydephil> yeah i wish i could still do 1080p/60fps but i can't due to Twitch's streaming limitations, 
it’d look choppy 

[12:35] <darksydephil> when i streamed on youtube they had unlimited stream quality and it worked 

[12:37] <darksydephil> im not ignoring you, you are asking a question that is pretty superfluous lol 

[12:37] <darksydephil> it's like asking if i like pizza or candy 

[12:40] <darksydephil> i am streaming at 60 fps 

[12:42] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:42] <darksydephil> stream workign all?

[12:39] <darksydephil> Delta, there's been no increase in viewership, tips or subs during Mario vs the other 
games 

[12:39] <darksydephil> so I will continue to alternate between them, plus I like them all 
[12:39] <darksydephil> Deep you've reverted back to your original name? 

[12:40] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay all, is the stream working nicely?

[12:18] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:19] <darksydephil> getting the initial stream ready and then getting into costume 
[12:22] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[12:22] <darksydephil> compatibility error with Call of Cthulhu 
[12:23] <darksydephil> says it has issues with windows 10 
[12:23] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> so everyone voted for a game that nobody bothered to see if it actually still works 
[12:25] <darksydephil> okay i got it working 
[12:25] <darksydephil> now to see if i can capture it 

[12:26] <darksydephil> the stream isn’t starting in 5 minutes, i dont have anything working yet 

[12:27] <darksydephil> im gonna have a ton of issues with this game, be its old and not very compatible with 

capturing lol 

[12:29] <darksydephil> okay it kind of works, it’ll take adjustment before i start capturing this one, thankfully its 
the only PC game i'm playing so we can just do normal PS4 stuff afterward 
[12:30] <darksydephil> 4th game is only if something goes wrong with teh first 3 
[12:31] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:31] <darksydephil> im going to start the stream now 

[12:31] <darksydephil> im going to get into costume while you guys start to join and get ready etc

[12:32] <darksydephil> okay stream going live, im going to go get dressed, be back in a few! it takes a while to 
put this one lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> im in costume, oh boy lol 
[12:45] <darksydephil> this is something else 
[12:46] <darksydephil> thanks pops, ill add it now 
[12:46] <darksydephil> ok fan art added 

[20:01] <darksydephil> in my opinion Manhunt was the worst of the 3 games lol 
[20:01] <darksydephil> it's seriously tedium made into a game, that's not my style at all 






[20:01] <darksydephil> it's for someone who apparently likes wasting LOTS OF TIME waiting and that's the 
opposite of what i like
