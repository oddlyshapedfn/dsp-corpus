[11:50] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hows everyone doing 

[11:51] <darksydephil> well, we just buried Raisin next to Cinnamon in the backyard 
[11:51] <darksydephil> so that's that, end of a chapter of our lives 

[11:52] <darksydephil> we threw away the remaining treats and stuff, packed up the cage, really weird feeling as 
they've been here since we moved in almost 3 years ago, first time we won't have them around 
[11:52] <darksydephil> yeah it is. But it's part of life 

[11:52] <darksydephil> they certainly had a good life here, the best of everything lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> we always joked they basically lived in a hamster mansion with gourmet food and the 
like, most hamsters don’t get it that good 

[11:53] <darksydephil> this is true theycallmejimbob and for all the worst reasons, not be i wasn't we weren’t 
having a good time together but because of really stupid shit outside of our control 
[11:53] <darksydephil> hopefully things turn around this month 

[11:54] <darksydephil> certainly it'll be a slow start as not many are going crazy for Yakuza 0, but there's tons of 

new releases coming. I certainly appreciate you guys being here every day despite what i’m playing 

[11:55] <darksydephil> actually i have to update the stream info and such, let me jump to the desktop 

[11:55] <darksydephil> thanks totallynotaviewbotl992

[12:03] <darksydephil> i have an announcement for kogaming today 

[12:04] <darksydephil> and its a good one, ill talk about it on prestream, an idea people have had for a bit and i 

had last year and its finally getting implemented 

[12:04] <darksydephil> i think it could really help the channel 

[12:07] <darksydephil> ok stream going live now 

[12:14] <darksydephil> yes stream should be going live now 

[12:14] <darksydephil> if it isn't already

[12:20] <darksydephil> Gino believes that people don’t have bodily functions lol

[12:21] <darksydephil> kg, you didn’t offer jack shit 

[12:22] <darksydephil> so ill tell you right now, cut the shit or you'll find yourself gone 
[12:22] <darksydephil> nobody is amused by you

[11:53] <darksydephil> OMFG 

[11:53] <darksydephil> this guy superimposed 9 deaths at once to the same mob, its fucking hilarious 

[11:59] <darksydephil> this is really interesting be the two different people who made the dark souls montages 

emphasized 2 totally different things 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ok fi nished watching the montage 

[12:06] <darksydephil> now gonna set up the stream 

[12:06] <darksydephil> no fan art submitted so it'll just be the prestream screen 
[12:07] <darksydephil> nope im setting up now 
[12:09] <darksydephil> oh jesus lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> none of this is intentional btw, all of these abbreviations and acronyms lol

[12:11] <darksydephil> holy fuck, 100k bit symbol? LOL 

[12:12] <darksydephil> thats. 

[12:12] <darksydephil> quite frivolous lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> the best part is, you know that was a HUGE streamer who didn't need the money 
[12:13] <darksydephil> probably paid the taxes on his yacht with it 
[12:14] <darksydephil> sweet, my dashboard says i have 1 viewer!

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170204-01 YAKUZA 0 6TH.LOG 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:51] <darksydephil> getting everything in order here 
[11:51] <darksydephil> gonna be more Yakuza today, sweet 






[11:53] <darksydephil> yeah its fine, it really didnt matter as im doing injustice tomorrow 
[11:53] <darksydephil> just a days difference 

[11:53] <darksydephil> its good since it'll give me a day away so i dont get burnt out and i was craving more 
yakuza regardless 

[11:54] <darksydephil> holy crap, skysands just made some epic fanart for nioh this week 
[11:54] <darksydephil> same guy that drew the pokemon art 

[11:55] <darksydephil> well you can't be THAT demanding with fighters, its never gonna be perfect, id say 
60ms and under is acceptable 

[11:55] <darksydephil> at least from what i saw yesterday,a nything around there was fine, above that had 
noticeable lag 

[11:56] <darksydephil> so im back to using my turtle beach xp seven headphones 

[11:56] <darksydephil> for those who don’t know, these are the headphones i started using in 2013 when i first 
went to direct capture, lol 

[11:57] <darksydephil> ive come full circle, started with turtle beach, then trittons, then astro a40s, back to 
trittons, now turtle beach 

[11:57] <darksydephil> yeah, well i used the turtle beach for all of 2013 and into 2014, then they broke 

[11:57] <darksydephil> so i got them fixed under warranty and started using the trittons. within like 5 months the 

trittons cracked and i sent THEM in under warranty 

[11:58] <darksydephil> so then for the rest of 2014 and into 2016 i just used the astro a40s 
[11:58] <darksydephil> but then when i started using the PSVR, i decided to switch back to the trittons 
and....now they broke again, so thats 4 months of use, AGAIN, and they cracked, the design is just shit, and 
they're no longer under warranty, so they're basically garbage now 

[11:59] <darksydephil> the good thing about the turtle beach ones, they have the best mixer hardware, so like, 

you get GREAT base, voices stand out, you can even manually adjust the surround sound levels if something 

sounds off or too low, loud, i really liked them a lot when i was using them for that year 

[11:59] <darksydephil> so hopefully they don’t fing break again 

[12:01] <darksydephil> oh shit 

[12:01] <darksydephil> forgot to edit dsp tries it 

[12:01] <darksydephil> let me do that FAST righ tnow lol 

[12:01] <darksydephil> nah, too late, ill just do it after the stream ends 

[12:02] <darksydephil> fuck man 

[12:02] <darksydephil> this one SUUUUUCKED 

[12:02] <darksydephil> like, nearly ruined our meal, thank god i got a backup 
[12:09] <darksydephil> test 
[12:09] <darksydephil> ok good 

[12:09] <darksydephil> was frozen for a sec, had to refresh 
[12:09] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:10] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:10] <darksydephil> ill tweet it out in a sec then 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i love the awards shows, they just reward any movie that isn't the norm 
[12:11] <darksydephil> remember that "silent film" with the dog a few years back?? 

[12:11] <darksydephil> now its a musical lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yeah didnt it have john goodman and the dog 
[12:12] <darksydephil> black and white, no spoken dialogue 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i saw it, it was good but it didnt blow me away, they just reward stuff that's purposely 
not the mainstream 

[12:13] <darksydephil> just comes off as snooty to me, i dunno. like Journey winning game of hte year over stuff 
that was far better and took a lot more work 
[12:13] <darksydephil> but to each their own 
[12:13] <darksydephil> ok let me tweet that we’re live 

[12:14] <darksydephil> i didnt see and wont ever see la la land so i have no idea lol 
[12:14] <darksydephil> i have no desire to see those actors dancing and singing on cars 



[12:15] <darksydephil> im not even sure if RYan Gossling or whatever is an actor, just a pretty face 
[12:19] <darksydephil> man, i need to start thinking of ideas for february's patron goal, i have no idea at this 
pointlol 

[12:19] <darksydephil> another marathon of some sort? 

[12:19] <darksydephil> im actually going to do another twitch and chill regardless, i want to do at least once a 
month now moving forward 

[12:20] <darksydephil> i could do a bad games marathon as long as they're not expensive 

[12:21] <darksydephil> mgs redemption run could be a good goal as a playthrough but not a marathon, since i 

wouldn't finish it and people would be pissed 

[12:21] <darksydephil> well some of these are pretty good ideas, thanks all 

[12:23] <darksydephil> yeah im gonna do twitch and chill the next to last week of february when there are no 
major new releases, perfect time for it 

[12:23] <darksydephil> plus thats about a month after the last one 
[15:22] <darksydephil> you can’t save 

[15:22] <darksydephil> for like, over 30 minutes there hasn't been a svae point lol

[14:20] <darksydephil> "but i can'ts seeee it! it mustah not be delayed!" 

[14:21] <darksydephil> because the connections aren’t equal, dingus 

[14:21] <darksydephil> which is why people are quitting against me when the match says 20ms on my side lol 
[14:21] <darksydephil> no, the connections aren’t equal for anybody 
[14:21] <darksydephil> thats why this is a beta test 

[15:49] <darksydephil> are you guys going to like, watch the steram, or should i just close the chat? 

[15:49] <darksydephil> seriously, what the fuck are you people talking about 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170206-01 YAKUZA 0 7TH.LOG 

[12:06] <darksydephil> what a piece of trash facebook is 
[12:06] <darksydephil> yeah, and im pretty fucked 





[12:06] <darksydephil> ive been playing a mobile game for over 6+ months, tons of time invested and the 
ONLY backup is facebook 

[12:07] <darksydephil> of course some dumb fuck locked my account by trying to get into it repeateldy, now the 
game is completely fucked up 

[12:07] <darksydephil> and theres no way to fix the account apparently 
[12:07] <darksydephil> so...tons of time invested and apparently wasted 
[12:18] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:18] <darksydephil> thanks deep, i wrote that down 
[12:18] <darksydephil> setting up stream now, enough wasted time 
[12:23] <darksydephil> ok im going to get the stream going 
[12:23] <darksydephil> sorry for the delay all 
[12:26] <darksydephil> OMFG 

[12:27] <darksydephil> best comment ever on the dark souls montage that i posted up last night 

[12:27] <darksydephil> "this is just a plain montage, not enough flair or variety to it. it proves that phil doesn’t 

have fun doing this anymore or care about his work." 

[12:27] <darksydephil> I....didn’t make the montage, the guy is literally an idiot 

[12:27] <darksydephil> yup 

[12:27] <darksydephil> and its glorious 

[12:27] <darksydephil> ive already gotten messages about tons more 

[12:28] <darksydephil> if the nintendo music gets matched, the video will either get muted or have ads removed 

[12:29] <darksydephil> ok stream will be live in a moment 

[12:33] <darksydephil> whoa we've got some pretty mellow Nioh music today 

[12:35] <darksydephil> ok stream working? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> music is so calming lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> ill have to mute it though for prestream 

[12:39] <darksydephil> ok i tweeted 

[12:39] <darksydephil> ill start talking in a minute here 

[12:40] <darksydephil> just blowing my nose 

[12:41] <darksydephil> yeah, I can’t believe they opened our borders again and let that Plutonian in to do the 
Superbowl halftime show yesterday 

[12:41] <darksydephil> i mean wtf, that thing can't be human! 

[12:41] <darksydephil> lol 
[12:42] <darksydephil> hey guys

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170207-01 NIOH 1ST.LOG 

[12:03] <darksydephil> hello all 
[12:03] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:03] <darksydephil> ill probably do the game giveaway at the end of this 1st stream session 

[12:03] <darksydephil> that way if the giveaway function of nightbot doesn’t work we can figure somethign out 

[12:05] <darksydephil> i see your new fanart pops! adding it now 

[12:11] <darksydephil> got some nice stuff set up for this game 

[12:12] <darksydephil> hope people like it 

[12:12] <darksydephil> almost ready to start 




[12:15] <darksydephil> really, Nioh isn't on xbox one or PC? 

[12:15] <darksydephil> i didnt know that 

[12:15] <darksydephil> please be patient, im setting up now. i know people are anxious to see this start, but ill be 
playing it for weeks lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> ok so i think the giveaway will be stream chat based 
[12:21] <darksydephil> i have the bot set up to do it, but never tried it before 
[12:21] <darksydephil> yeah thats what im doing GodRevanRyu 
[12:21] <darksydephil> ok all lets do a demo test 

[12:22] <darksydephil> im going to ask you to type a word into strema chat 
[12:22] <darksydephil> do it and lets see what happens 

[12:22] <darksydephil> ok everyone, type "testword" into stream chat right now 
[12:22] <darksydephil> ok good, its working 

[12:23] <darksydephil> ok ill give it 60 seconds then pull a "winner" lol 
[12:24] <darksydephil> ok, going to pick a test winner! 

[12:25] <darksydephil> i just used nightbot 
[12:25] <darksydephil> and no, its not only subs 

[12:25] <darksydephil> there were 75 entrants and it was random selection, no priority given to subs 
[12:25] <darksydephil> so i guess what i would do is PM the winner the code over twitch chat 
[12:26] <darksydephil> ok so we’re good to go for the giveaway! Sweet 
[12:26] <darksydephil> time to start prestream now i guess 
[16:17] <darksydephil> congrats no hero! 

[16:17] <darksydephil> hope you like the game 

[16:19] <darksydephil> im assuming the code worked as N0 H3R0 isn't talking anymore lol 

[16:20] <darksydephil> there may be more giveaways in the future like this, as i've gotten offers for free 

giveaway stuff 

[16:20] <darksydephil> happy to see that nightbot worked as well, its a legit way to do giveaways 

[16:22] <darksydephil> yeah there are 1-2 people who have offered to give me codes for stuff to give away to 

viewers moving forward 

[16:22] <darksydephil> so if i get one, ill do this on the premiere streams 
[16:26] <darksydephil> not everyone watching has a ps4 

[16:26] <darksydephil> in fact id bet a ton of people who watch gameplay vids/streams dont have the consoles 
themselves, thats why they watch 

[16:26] <darksydephil> plus this is ps4 exclusive, so xbox/pc owners are boned

[19:09] <darksydephil> the hawk seemed fine to me? 

[19:09] <darksydephil> it made me faster at least 
[19:09] <darksydephil> and the abilities were fine in combat 
[19:09] <darksydephil> so far faster seems better

im going to die in 1-2 hits lol 

[19:10] <darksydephil> well we'll see right now 

[19:10] <darksydephil> as im finally doing something new in game

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170208-01 NIOH 3RD.LOG 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:54] <darksydephil> so i have a serious question to pose to you all. what is going on with KOGaming? people 
asked me to put up more regular content there, so i have been, and viewership is now way down, like, serious 
WTF 

[11:55] <darksydephil> im pretty stumped honestly 

[11:56] <darksydephil> well look at the videos ive posted in the last 2 weeks 

[11:56] <darksydephil> RE7 review has 9400 views, thats good 

[11:56] <darksydephil> twitch and chill montage has 6.2k views, thats OK 

[11:56] <darksydephil> then my RE7 PSVR video has only 4.4k views after being up almost a week? 

[11:56] <darksydephil> the dark souls montage finally topped 5k views today, thats good considering its the first 
in the series 

[11:57] <darksydephil> but my injustice 2 beta thoughts has been out for 2 days and doens't even have 3k 
views?!? for a channel with over 20k subs, i have no idea wtf is going on 

[11:57] <darksydephil> i dunno. its just that im putting lots of time/effort into these vids and i can't even get 3k 
views on them, thats definitely not worth it 

[11:58] <darksydephil> i could have played yakuza 0 and gotten more out of it lol 

[11:58] <darksydephil> tonight im doing a 1st impressions on Nioh vid, later this week will be more KOGaming 
community submissions 

[11:58] <darksydephil> and subs have completely stagnated on the channel, they’re not going up at all despite all 
the new content 

[12:09] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:11] <darksydephil> God Revan Ryu i dunno? she wasn't very hard as long as you dodge the paralyze attacks 
[12:11] <darksydephil> ill probably never go to E3 again, honestly, theres no reason to be there, i know from 
experience lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> E3 isn’t a con, at all. it's an inclusive, elitist press event wher eyou wait in crazy lines to 
play a game for 5 minutes, when you can just see the same gameplay online in a video 
[12:13] <darksydephil> and the "swag" you get is all junk lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> and the games you actually want to see, you can't, because they only let SPECIAL 

ELITE reporters play them, pretty fucking dumb 

[12:14] <darksydephil> [schedule 

[12:14] <darksydephil> there we go, i updated it 

[12:15] <darksydephil> i went to E3 and vlogged it in 2012 

[12:15] <darksydephil> basically the only thing worth it was getting to play RE6 hands on early, thats all 
[12:15] <darksydephil> nothing else mattered, it was all online nad we actuall got more info reading the internet 
than being there in person lol 

[12:15] <darksydephil> there were 3 games we wanted to see that they weouldn't even let us 
[12:16] <darksydephil> ok prestream time

[12:01] <darksydephil> NICE 

[12:02] <darksydephil> managed to just finish the editing of the new KOGaming community montage 

[12:02] <darksydephil> just have to actually encode it but ill do that after the stream 

[12:02] <darksydephil> hello 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ok setting up stream now 

[12:06] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[12:06] <darksydephil> Nioh just loaded an update file! 

[12:06] <darksydephil> watch this quadruple the difficulty lol 

[12:07] <darksydephil> 1.02 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i barely got any sleep 

[12:08] <darksydephil> one of those nights where i just coudln’t get to sleep for no particular reason 
[12:08] <darksydephil> so this should be fun.... 

[12:08] <darksydephil> what blizzard? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> the snow was monday, lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> theres no snow here, temps are now in the 40s so nothing can freeze 
[12:13] <darksydephil> there are parts of Washington that get snow all the time though, just not here 

[12:13] <darksydephil>. 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i live in the Seattle area 

[12:13] <darksydephil> whatever weather you're reading, stop 

[12:13] <darksydephil> its bu nk lol 

[12:16] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:17] <darksydephil> nobody is mad, the dislikes are from the same 100 idiots 
[12:17] <darksydephil> they dislike every video on kogaming lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> theres also something wrong with sub notifications, as its obvious nobody on 
KOGaming is being told im uploading new videos 

[12:18] <darksydephil> sorry but 3 days and only 3k views on the injustice 2 vid is bullshit 

[12:18] <darksydephil> and the Nioh vid had 2k views when i went to sleep, woke up 6+ hours later, same views 

lol 


-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170210-01 NIOH 5TH.LOG 

[11:44] <darksydephil> oh good lord 

[11:44] <darksydephil> staying AWAY from politics yet again tday lol 
[11:44] <darksydephil> i can't take it 
[11:45] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:57] <darksydephil> should i be breaking down the weapons at the blacksmith? 

[11:57] <darksydephil> wtf chat crashed 
[11:57] <darksydephil> sign 
[11:57] <darksydephil> ok back 

[11:58] <darksydephil> so dont keep offering stuff to the shrine, instead break down weapons at the blacksmith? 
[11:58] <darksydephil> i havent done that be it seems you just find so much fing loot i assumed it'd be better 
than what you can forge anyway 

[11:59] <darksydephil> ok, i had noi dea you could craft set gear 

[11:59] <darksydephil> it seems offering stuff up has worked well as i always have full elixirs 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok ill give it a shot 

[12:03] <darksydephil> so high familiarity items sell fo rmoney 

[12:03] <darksydephil> other items break down 

[12:03] <darksydephil> and the crappiest items offer up to the shrines 

[12:04] <darksydephil> yeah i havent seen any skill transfers yet in soul match, but i was hoping there would be 
[12:07] <darksydephil> so summoner candles get you out of a pickle, gotcha 
[12:10] <darksydephil> there we go 






[12:10] <darksydephil> chat is wonky for me today, keeps locking up 
[12:10] <darksydephil> working again now 

[12:10] <darksydephil> also my stream is live but shows as offline, no viewers on my dashboard lol 
[12:11] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:12] <darksydephil> gotta LOVE the dumbfuck reactions to the new KOGaming montage i released last 
night, hundreds of thumbs down with the best criticisms being "it's too blurry" and "these jokes aren’t pertinent" 
and "it's too short" lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> when you're grasping at fucking straws to criticize something, time to realize you're a 
moron 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yeah that new montage was great IMO, short and sweet and constantly funny 
[12:13] <darksydephil> but jealous kids who have made awful *** vids for years are so insanely jealous that it 
got featured, they literally have to nitpick 

[12:14] <darksydephil> there are at least 2 more montages on the way, and possibility of a 3rd if its finished this 
week 

[12:14] <darksydephil> akio, not that montage 
[12:14] <darksydephil> an upcoming one 

[12:14] <darksydephil> btw stream up and working? ill tweet if so 
[12:15] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:17] <darksydephil> 2 bosses yesterday, and boy do they showcase the dos and donts of game design lol 
[12:20] <darksydephil> audio hiccup? huh? 

[12:22] <darksydephil> just because a new montage is short and isn’t super negative like *** doesn't make it bad. 
it just makes YOU stupid for calling it bad, lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> there are plenty of legit reasons for calling something bad, sadly most of the "criticism" 
of the new montage isn’t valid at all 

[12:23] <darksydephil> if it's an unjustified opinion with nothing to back it up? yes, it makes them stupid 
[12:23] <darksydephil> it's hating fo rthe sake of hating because of jealousy, honestly 
[12:24] <darksydephil> what makes you think i didnt know that? lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> do you think im retarded? tha ti didn’t check his channel beforehand? 

[12:25] <darksydephil> every montage is going to be different, different people have different styles, there's an 
official *** style vid coming up in hte next few days too. different strokes for different folks 
[12:26] <darksydephil> just because not every video im featuring isn't a *** style doens't mean they're all bad. it 
just means the people complaining have a specific taste and nee dto grow up 

[12:26] <darksydephil> yeah thats enough. 3 lines shitting on it without anything valid to say, get the fuck out 
[12:26] <darksydephil> what im saying makes perfect sense, actually 

[12:27] <darksydephil> its the difference between being a mature human and a self-absorbed immature idiot 
[12:27] <darksydephil> some people don’t get that though 
[12:27] <darksydephil> ok time for prestream 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170211-01 NIOH 6TH.LOG 

[11:49] <darksydephil> maybe this argument would stand a bit better if I hadn't personally timed out 
KingjadVCMP for insults and misbehavior myself in the past 
[11:49] <darksydephil> you're no angel, bro 

[11:51] <darksydephil> i dont even know what you're talking about 

[11:52] <darksydephil> im certainly the last person to consult as im playing games when the stream is going, i 
dunno what's happening here 

[11:53] <darksydephil> k well if thats the case, he shoudln't be doing that 
[11:54] <darksydephil> brb restroom 
[12:09] <darksydephil> ok back 

[12:09] <darksydephil> stream will be up in a moment, was in the bathroom lol 
[12:10] <darksydephil> im not sure that's how it works? 

[12:10] <darksydephil> like, you can’t technically be a 7 month sub until 7 months pass 
[12:11] <darksydephil> exactly 




[12:11] <darksydephil> just because you buy a sub for 7 months doesn't earn you the badge, the time actually has 
to elapse, i guess 

[12:18] <darksydephil> i was busy banning idiots from KOgaming, thats all 

[12:18] <darksydephil> so of course they had awful autoplaying videos on their tiny shitty YT channels lol 
[12:19] <darksydephil> ok so stream working fine? 

[12:19] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:20] <darksydephil> what are you people talking about? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> there was no porn ad lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> that was an idiot talking shit on KOGaming about a community submission 
[12:22] <darksydephil> i was blocking him, but you have to manually do it from the channels now, so it 
autoplayed his dumb video with like 50 views on it 
[12:26] <darksydephil> well thats true i guess 

[12:26] <darksydephil> so, out of like the 8 side missions ive done, one was good lol 
[12:26] <darksydephil> sadly it seems like this game has a LOT of padding 
[12:26] <darksydephil> 60 hours but 40+ hours are just the side bullshit 

[12:28] <darksydephil> yeah it seems you're kind of locked into your weapon loadout for hte game's length 
unless you respec? unless i’m wrong but it seems putting points into skill, which was my weapon specialization, 
helps tons while oter stuff barely does anything 

[12:29] <darksydephil> because i picked that specialization at the start,? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i think spears are skill scalin 

[12:29] <darksydephil> 2 out of he 3 things that i picked in the intro were skill specializations 
[12:30] <darksydephil> aha that makes sense LadyPeorth thanks 
[16:04] <darksydephil> apologies for forgetting shout outs all 

[16:04] <darksydephil> im actually in a hurry today, leanna has to get to work so we have to eat fast 
[16:04] <darksydephil> but ill do them tomorrow for today as well

[11:47] <darksydephil> ok no elim chamber spoilers 

[11:47] <darksydephil> since i couldn’t fing watch it thanks to wwe network not working, AGAIN 

[11:48] <darksydephil> and then their twitter sends me an apology like that matters, how about fixing your fing 

app which has always had this problem with new PPVs since it first launched 

[11:48] <darksydephil> yeah the app is awful honestly, it has TONS of bugs they never fix 

[11:49] <darksydephil> people constantly complain that hte live ppv shows wont play properly and nothing has 

ever been done to change it 

[11:49] <darksydephil> it seems in general people liked it 

[11:49] <darksydephil> i guess we’re going to watch it tonight now 

[11:49] <darksydephil> refund? LOL 

[11:50] <darksydephil> i couldn't imagine if it was my job to cover wrestling and shit like this happened all the 
time, id lose my shit 

[11:51] <darksydephil> smark guys was a show we did, but it was far from my full time job 

[11:52] <darksydephil> im talking people whose job it is to cover this kind of stuff full time 

[11:52] <darksydephil> imagine if you relied on the wwe network to work for these shows and it constantly 

fucked up, and all they did was send you a twitter apology lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> most cable companies dropped the ppvs btw 

[11:53] <darksydephil> since the buyrates tanked 

[11:54] <darksydephil> damn i had the wrong date in the channel info 

[11:54] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:57] <darksydephil> tonights KOGaming vid.... 

[11:57] <darksydephil> it's interesting, some great stuff, some cringe stuff, one part i pissed myself laughing at 
[11:58] <darksydephil> its about 40 minutes long 





[12:01] <darksydephil> well im hoping people will see tonight's *** vid and be inspired to make more 
[12:01] <darksydephil> right now things are drying up, i have one more vid in the pipeline but no ETA on when 
it'll be ready 

[12:01] <darksydephil> selling KOGaming? nobody wants to buy my channels lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> but yeah, im hoping some people will start working on more montages but we'll see. it 
would suck if i had this first batch and then people lost interest 
[12:02] <darksydephil> OK stream will be live in a sec 
[12:04] <darksydephil> oh yeah 

[12:04] <darksydephil> please let me knwo if you think audio is slightly desynched today 

[12:04] <darksydephil> i intentionally recorded the WIP in 720p last night to try and avoid that 

[12:04] <darksydephil> be it seemed every Sunday the audio was desynching 

[12:05] <darksydephil> delta, id definitely post that up there 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ill remove that word from being banned 

[12:06] <darksydephil> hold on 

[12:07] <darksydephil> ok ban is lifted on tihydp 

[12:07] <darksydephil> what if i was fucking with you and you all got kicked lol 
[12:09] <darksydephil> lol when did i get a fashionista trophy? 

[12:10] <darksydephil> so apparently the gesture you need to instantly beat the demon walls is in that training 

dojo mission i need 1 more dexterity to do 

[12:10] <darksydephil> so, thats the next level im getting today 

[12:11] <darksydephil> hello

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170214-01 FOR HONOR 1ST (CAMPAIGN).LOG 

[11:54] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:55] <darksydephil> uuuuh 

[11:58] <darksydephil> we’re starting with campaign on this stream 
[11:58] <darksydephil> so we’ll see 
[11:58] <darksydephil> as for tihydp, i dont make them 
[11:58] <darksydephil> so it depends on what's submitted 

[11:59] <darksydephil> someone already contacted me saying they have a THREE HOUR LONG tihydp of 
metroid prime that they never uploaded 

[11:59] <darksydephil> im skeptical to approve that one. theres no way i can even proofwatch it lol 
[12:02] <darksydephil> adjusting capture settings now 

[12:02] <darksydephil> this game is only 30fps so i can capture at 1080p for a change 
[12:03] <darksydephil> nope its 30 just like the alpha nd beta were 
[12:04] <darksydephil> well to be fair 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ive not exactly the cleanest rep when it comes to anti Semitic jokes, i made 2 ever, and 
paid for it lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> luckily that was long before i even blew up on YT 
[12:05] <darksydephil> i didnt say i supported nazis though...thats bizarre 

[12:06] <darksydephil> what i did was more innocent, it was imitating a parody from the howard stern show, and 
ive apologized for it and would NEVER do something like that again 

[12:07] <darksydephil> these are new vids that pewdiepie just posted? like how dumb can you be? multi 
millionaire, let's post up nazi shit?? 

[12:07] <darksydephil> lol yeah 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i have to do a demo recording 

[12:09] <darksydephil> nobody was fucking watching the youtube red shit anyway lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> the views on youtube red content were abysmal compared to anything actually popular 
on youtube 




[12:09] <darksydephil> i may have to restrat the stream, give me a sec to test 

[12:09] <darksydephil> yup i gotta restart 

[12:09] <darksydephil> giv erne a sec 

[12:11] <darksydephil> OK stream is workign now 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i have no idea what PDP actually said, so its very well likely that the dead space video is 
worse lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i look back on that video now and im like...okay, yeah, awful idea 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i got super lucky that happened before i actually started doing YT for money, during that 

transitional period 

[12:14] <darksydephil> comments on the TIHYDP vid from last night are just bizarre 

[12:14] <darksydephil> some people think i made the video, some people think im claiming to have created 

TIHYDP to begin with, some people think i edited the video to make it tame, its just weird shit, people pull stuff 

straight out of their assholes 

[12:19] <darksydephil> ok stream working fine? 

[12:22] <darksydephil> fuzzy, it was the first one id ever approved and posted, without an intro, how would it 

even make sense? lol 

[13:18] <darksydephil> bethe, stop 

[13:18] <darksydephil> you're wrong lol 

[13:18] <darksydephil> that unlocks it to listen to by itself, not in game 

[14:02] <darksydephil> yes its locked at 30fps 

[14:47] <darksydephil> my mic isnt working wtf 

[14:48] <darksydephil> i need to restart the stream briefly all

[11:59] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:00] <darksydephil> stream should be live shortly 

[12:00] <darksydephil> sadly the campaign of this game is average, but more fun than the MP lol 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ok starting the stream 

[12:04] <darksydephil> fyi might have to restart it to fix the OBS capture issue 
[12:04] <darksydephil> so we’ll see 
[12:05] <darksydephil> yes, every game is awful lol 
[12:05] <darksydephil> thats why i play them full time 

[12:06] <darksydephil> so of all people, loophole send me a TIHYDP video for consideration for KOGaming. i 
didnt watch it yet but thats going to be a BIG leap of faith to trust him, but he did apologize for the excessive 
trolling in the past 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i honestly think loophole just wants more exposure, this TIHYDP is like 50 minutes long 
and it’s from my Deus Ex MD playthrough from last year and didn't even get 2k views, id be pissed too if i put in 
a ton of work and nobody even checked it out 

[12:09] <darksydephil> but i haven't watched it yet either, so i haev no idea whats in it lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> and to be fair, he hasn't trolled at all in a long time 

[12:09] <darksydephil> shit, ever since I was SWATed i dont thi nk ive heard from him 

[12:10] <darksydephil> well DragonSlayerVlogs TIHYDP is now up to 8.5k views and still growing 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ok is the stream working? 

[12:12] <darksydephil> sweet 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we’r elive 

[12:15] <darksydephil> the sauce was delicious as always 

[12:15] <darksydephil> we added cheese to it this time 

[12:16] <darksydephil> and it made it taste even better 

[12:16] <darksydephil> lol Gino you still playing supercard? 

[12:16] <darksydephil> i started playing this other WWE game now thats basically bejewelled with WWE 
wrestlers 

[12:16] <darksydephil> it looks silly but its actually pretty fun 
[12:16] <darksydephil> wait not bejewelled, i think it slike candy crush 
[12:17] <darksydephil> yeah it does look like WWE all stars actually 

[12:17] <darksydephil> its cheap but fun. i love it when the CPU decides to get a 6 hit combo for gems that 
weren't even on the screen, SO PSYCHIC 

[12:22] <darksydephil> its a bit too late to just be playing league of legends, no? lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> one of the few things i ever remember reading was a post by Totalbiscuit, about how 
when he played LoL he sucked be he didn’t know how to play, and even his viewers trolled the fuck out of him 
[12:23] <darksydephil> insulting him nonstop for sucking lol. what a great community! 

[13:04] <darksydephil> yeah, thats completely wrong dspolecat lol 

[13:04] <darksydephil> p2p is awful for multiplayer, thats why EVERYONE abandoned it 
[13:44] <darksydephil> which is how i won, dumb fuck 
[13:44] <darksydephil> lol 

[16:07] <darksydephil> clusterfuck of a final boss fight, sigh

your heads aren't fun....in 2017

[11:52] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ok stream should be starting up 
[12:12] <darksydephil> flat earth lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> the other day someone say something incredibly stupid on twitter and i asked them if 
they were a flat earther too. someone responded to the tweet saying they were insulted be IRL theya re a flat 
earther 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i was like 

[12:13] <darksydephil>. 

[12:14] <darksydephil> Oh yeah, i firmly believe the reason that i can never grow from where i am now has 
nothing to do with me. ive tried great ideas, im constantly doing new/fun stuff and listening to feedback 
[12:14] <darksydephil> but when you have an entire group of thousands of mentally ill idiots whose only desire 
is to have you fail, you're pretty fucked 

[12:14] <darksydephil> i mean, just look at the comments on my videos now and how many downvotes 
everything gets, even for GOOD gameplay and the like 

[12:15] <darksydephil> its become a sickening mob mentality from a generation of do-nothing nobodies whose 
only sense of worth is being a group of bandwagoning negative shitheads. without it they have nothing of value 
[12:15] <darksydephil> lolol 

[12:16] <darksydephil> you just described the vast majority of my detractors actually 
[12:16] <darksydephil> whoa thanks silentgeneral! Stream isnt even running yet haha 
[12:17] <darksydephil> i dont even consider it ignorance CapstoneGaming . i can't blame ANYONE for 
disliking me be the vast majority of shit out there is blatant lies/misinformation that a giant group keeps saying 
an nauseum 

[12:17] <darksydephil> oh, that wasn’t loophole, it was some idiot impersonating him apparently 
[12:18] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we’re live and then do final setup etc 

[12:23] <darksydephil> yeah i believe more peopel will be getting th eupgraded badges now 

[12:23] <darksydephil> since its the 3 month anniversary of streaming

[11:53] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:53] <darksydephil> triple g unit 

[11:53] <darksydephil> so someone tipped me into a really good onmyo magic spell that ive overlooked 

[11:54] <darksydephil> might have to check that out today, it appraently breaks the game and people are saying 

they're going to patch it out lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> purple polka dot 

[11:54] <darksydephil> i think its called sloth or sluggish or something like that riouinsuiko 

[11:54] <darksydephil> it appraently slows down time, but you remain moving at full speed, it destroys bosses if 

you can do enough damage 

[11:55] <darksydephil> i guess a LOT of people are using that ability 
[12:09] <darksydephil> ok stream starting now 

[12:11] <darksydephil> um, worst games marathon is the goal for this month, we haven’t hit it yet, therefore 

nothign can be nominated yet lol 

[12:21] <darksydephil> shit i forgot to tweet lol 

[12:21] <darksydephil> ill do that right now 

[12:21] <darksydephil> um im not even in the room lolol

[11:39] <darksydephil> just got here 

[11:40] <darksydephil> i will have a full update on the situation regarding the TIHYDP video tomorrow, and 

tonight im reviewing a few new entries, so i may have a new one for tomorrow as well 

[11:41] <darksydephil> i honestly haven’t had a chance to even look over 2-3 entries that peopel sent me 

[11:41] <darksydephil> i spent 5 hours doing the For Honor review last night lol 

[11:41] <darksydephil> so hopefully it does ewll 

[11:41] <darksydephil> well 

[11:41] <darksydephil> 4k views already is a good sign 

[11:42] <darksydephil> yup. an hour for the voiceovers, about 30 mins for the thumbnail, and then a shitton of 
editing 

[11:42] <darksydephil> pretty much, i didnt even look at comments or likes/dislikes, i dont give a shit 

[11:42] <darksydephil> that was the most fact based review ithink ive ever done, i analyzed the shit out of it 

[11:45] <darksydephil> 284 viewers currently watching yakuza 0 

[11:45] <darksydephil> we’ll get those numbers up a bit lol 

[11:50] <darksydephil> wow it got cold and windy overnight 

[11:50] <darksydephil> chilly here in the office! 

[11:51] <darksydephil> gotta close the window a bit 
[11:52] <darksydephil> so let's see 

[11:52] <darksydephil> the last entire week streaming has been great every day, lots of people subbing and 
cheering 

[11:52] <darksydephil> lets see how Yakuza 0 tanks that, LOL 
[11:53] <darksydephil> fell all the way down the staircase? ouch 
[11:53] <darksydephil> wait a minute 

[11:53] <darksydephil> didnt you have a broken leg last year?! 

[11:54] <darksydephil> holy christ man 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ive never broken a darn thing 

[11:55] <darksydephil> nothing is broken in my back, its the disc that's messed up 

[11:55] <darksydephil> the surgery would have been to fuse the bones together around the damaged disc, but the 
bones aren’t broken 

[11:57] <darksydephil> ok stream will be going live shortly 

[11:57] <darksydephil> as in, right now if everything works 

[12:00] <darksydephil> finally live? ok great 

[12:00] <darksydephil> dunno what took so long lol 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ugh so many phishing scam emails today 

[12:06] <darksydephil> apparently ive boughts tons of things i didnt authorize on ebay and my paypal account 
has been closed! OH NOES! 

[12:06] <darksydephil> Slurmdrinker , im not even going to read it lol 
[12:07] <darksydephil> theres no point 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i dont think ive ever actually seen a kickstart dcommercial except for like, 5 years ago 
when ti was new lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170220-01 NIOH 11TH.LOG 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:50] <darksydephil> setting up now for Nioh 

[11:52] <darksydephil> so i just received TIHYDP Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and at the same time, 
someone uploaded a ton of old TIHYDPs from my time filming with a camera, lol 
[11:52] <darksydephil> tonight i have to watch a bunch of them and decide which one i want to use first 
[11:53] <darksydephil> also despite all the rage from fans, my review of For Honor already has 9k views lol 
[11:54] <darksydephil> yup it is, now to see if the youtube search actually catches the video ro not 




[11:59] <darksydephil> aw man, a patron is upset:( 

[11:59] <darksydephil> they didn’t understand how the patrons choice nominations/poll would work, i guess they 
nominated a game they really wanted to see me play and thought it would make it to the poll no matter what, in 
this case, the only games that made it to the final poll got 2 or more nominations 

[12:00] <darksydephil> its my fault, i should have explained the entire process, i just kind of assume that 

everyone "gets it" because ive done these polls in the past 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i apologized to the guy 

[12:01] <darksydephil> well it was my fault, its the least i could do 

[12:02] <darksydephil> maybe, i think he just wanted to see his suggested game get a chance to be picked 
[12:03] <darksydephil> i totally get where hes coming from, these last few months ive had a LOT of new patrons 
and i kind of just assume they understand the whole process 
[12:04] <darksydephil> well this sure shows how ive grown as a person 

[12:04] <darksydephil> if this were 2008-2012 Phil, I probably would have responded to the guy defensively 

saying i did nothing wrong, so tough shit lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ive never even heard of danganronpa lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> if it wins im being told i should wait until march 17 to start as theres a PS4 remaster 
being released 

[12:09] <darksydephil> is the stream live? 

[12:09] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:09] <darksydephil> i have no damn idea why my twitch dashboard never updates 

[12:10] <darksydephil> well i do too, but mostly be i want to see how they end rather than im not enjoying them 

[12:10] <darksydephil> lets face it, most of this month has been those games ongoing lol 

[12:10] <darksydephil> we need to move on 

[12:12] <darksydephil> pi o, gpma tweet jat we 

[12:12] <darksydephil> re ;ove 

[12:12] <darksydephil> wtf 

[12:12] <darksydephil> hand was on the wrong keys lolol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> OK, im going to tweet that we’re live haha 

[12:14] <darksydephil> btw someone made a great point last night 

[12:14] <darksydephil> 'i can just reforce the red demon armor to be higher level 

[12:14] <darksydephil> reforge 

[12:14] <darksydephil> so ill check that out today, i doubt i have the components for it yet 
[12:14] <darksydephil> yup 

[12:15] <darksydephil> and i alreayd got a white level item when it was higher chance to be purple lol 
[12:15] <darksydephil> i do have to say, rng in crafting is bullshit 

[12:15] <darksydephil> if you're gonna spend big money and scarce resources, give me the fucking thing im 
supposed to get 

[16:07] <darksydephil> the death counter is correct, i added 2 deaths instead of 1 but nobody was paying 
attention lol 

[16:08] <darksydephil> that is definitely a troll boss 

[16:08] <darksydephil> no boss should have an instant kill animation at the END of the fight 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170221-01 NIOH 12TH.LOG 

[11:53] <darksydephil> oh great 

[11:53] <darksydephil> my PS4 randomly turned off for no reason 

[11:54] <darksydephil> maybe we had a power fluctuation or something overnight but i had it in standby mode, 
shit 

[11:54] <darksydephil> might have to do the stage entirely over, booting now to find out 
[11:54] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:56] <darksydephil> i think we’re okay....loading the stage now 
[11:56] <darksydephil> yup we’re fine 

[11:56] <darksydephil> this game autosaves a shitload so excellent 




[12:03] <darksydephil> ok we’re good to go 
[12:03] <darksydephil> nothing was lost 
[12:07] <darksydephil> ok stream wil be live shortly 
[12:12] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i can't get my damn dashboard to load 

[12:12] <darksydephil> hmm wtf. my dashboard is showing a bitrate being transmitted but the stream is showing 

as offline, wtf 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ?! 

[12:13] <darksydephil> um 

[12:14] <darksydephil> i have no idea what to do to fix this, because this has nothing to do with me... 

[12:14] <darksydephil> its not obs, twitch is showing that im broadcasting at the correct bitrate but wont display 
video 

[12:14] <darksydephil> its twitch 
[12:15] <darksydephil> still no stream? 

[12:15] <darksydephil> ill restart if i have to but i doubt its going to work 
[12:15] <darksydephil> oh its working now?? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> ok i just tweeted that we’re live, sorry for hte delay everyone 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170222-01 NIOH 13TH.LOG 

[11:48] <darksydephil> why would i leave twitch? 

[11:48] <darksydephil> that guy was a moron, lol 

[11:49] <darksydephil> that wasn't in anything i agreed to when i enabled the bits on the channel 

[11:50] <darksydephil> there's a 1 million bit badge, lol 

[11:53] <darksydephil> ok gonna go grab some drinks, then ill get started 

[11:54] <darksydephil> why are you talking about Tevin in here, exactly? 

[11:55] <darksydephil> this is my stream chat, why would you discuss people who regulardly denigrate me in 
here? 

[11:55] <darksydephil> use your head kid 

[11:57] <darksydephil> lol so today im wearing a new shirt from lootcrate 

[11:58] <darksydephil> and its a large, like all the shirts they send me. yet this one is tight as hell, other shirts 
they send are loose, how these companies still can't figure out that large is the same fucking size i dont get it lol 
[11:58] <darksydephil> ok let me get the stream running, then ill grab drinks 

[11:59] <darksydephil> but yeah, what great youtube analytics, they say that my views are down my 13% this 
month (which makes sense, RE7 boosted them last month) but ad revenue for DSPGaming is down by 35%. 
wow. what a great correlation there 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i did ask machinima. their initial reply was "you are on pace to have about hte same 

amount of ad impressions in february as you did in January." which doesn't answer the question, AT ALL, as to 

why those impressions are 35% less profitable, so i just wrote them back asking them that 

[12:02] <darksydephil> exactly jimbob, or at least its not proportionate, if i got 13% less views in february 

compared to January, it makes no sense id be making 35% less money, it should be equivalent and its not 

[12:05] <darksydephil> right, it cant be adblock if the impressions are the same as January 

[12:05] <darksydephil> it means its an actual issue with ad revenue and that's on youtube 

[12:05] <darksydephil> if it were an adblock issue, ad impressions would be way down, they're not 

[12:07] <darksydephil> id love ot know when Naomi actually hurt her leg, because she never sold it in the match 

[12:08] <darksydephil> viking, no, this is taking a proportionate amount of time in january vs february. not 

month vs month overall, february isn't over anyway, there’d be no way for that to factor in yet 

[12:08] <darksydephil> gino, did you watch smackdown? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> they had a match for the title lol 
[12:09] <darksydephil> i have no idea what you're talking about 
[12:13] <darksydephil> ok is the stream working? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i forgot to ask lol 
[12:13] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill shoot out a tweet 




[12:15] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks and then we'll start 
[15:35] <darksydephil> theres postgame stuff, no, this stream isn't extending 
[15:35] <darksydephil> lol 
[16:07] <darksydephil> great stream all! 

[16:07] <darksydephil> endgame is pretty good 

[16:07] <darksydephil> sucks be i guarantee ther ewas a fucking shrine through that door lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170223-01 NIOH 14TH, LEAK, CANCELLED AT BREAK.LOG 

[11:52] <darksydephil> no 

[11:52] <darksydephil> that was that idiot invading the stream 
[11:52] <darksydephil> not legit viewers lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> it was like 200 followers of some random guy invading streams that day 

[11:53] <darksydephil> Boogie is not "struggling." Maybe he's making less money but when you get 1 million 

views on each video you put out, you're rolling in dough. As in, he's making probably around 500k a year 

[11:54] <darksydephil> Nier Automata is out? release schedule said March 7th lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> that doesn't mean the game is out, dude 

[12:02] <darksydephil> you dont wear YouTuber shirts to school though, lol 

[12:03] <darksydephil> i certainly wouldn’t 

[12:03] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[12:03] <darksydephil> DX: E3 was always public for a price, actually, they just never talked about it publicly lol 
[12:03] <darksydephil> teespring doesn’t allow copyrighted characters 
[12:03] <darksydephil> so thats a no go 

[12:04] <darksydephil> it’d have to be me, my face/body etc with my slogans etc 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[12:06] <darksydephil> i think, if the common viewer contributed with just a cheer here, a sub here, buying a 
shirt every once in a while, doing a $1 patreon pledge, we’d be fine, issue is, from 2008-2015 it was just "watch 
and i’ll succeed, no worries about anything else" because i was still in one of the most lucrative YouTube 
contracts possible, then all that went away and people aren’t used to the "capitalist" mentality when watching my 
stuff, because for 7 years it wasn't necessary, now it VERY much is 
[12:06] <darksydephil> i mean, shit, did i ever advertise anything pre-2015? nope. 

[12:07] <darksydephil> think about it. while iw as just gaming on YouTube for so long, pretty much 
EVERYBODY else who was successful had to work partnership deals, advertisement, sponsorship and shill 
products etc 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i was lucky enough to not have to dot hat, but now sadly it looks like stuff is changing 
[12:08] <darksydephil> sponsored by lootcrate, and i make like $100 bucks amonth from it lol. no lie, almost 
nobody uses the referral code 

[12:08] <darksydephil> even though i plug the fuck out of it 

[12:08] <darksydephil> thats what i mean though, people have no idea how important that stuff is 
[12:09] <darksydephil> they just think "Watch and phil will succeed!" sadly, not anymore. 

[12:09] <darksydephil> eternia, thats exactly how it works 

[12:09] <darksydephil> its not just one video 

[12:09] <darksydephil> if the pledge continues, the vids continue 

[12:10] <darksydephil> thats exactly right CapstoneGaming , the fact of the matter is, that wont be the case 
shortly if poeple don't actually take REAL action for once 

[12:10] <darksydephil> people make fun of me for saying $1 a month helps me but is nothing to the common 
viewer, but it's 100% true, if every stream viewer and every youtube viewer gave $1 a month, i wouldn’t even 
NEED ad revenue, and it's LITERALLY NOTHING to give a dollar 

[12:11] <darksydephil> impossible CapstoneGaming . we only have one car and cannot afford another, and i 
cannot keep up with youtube and do a job at the same time, it’d revert back to how it was from 2008-2010 and i 
can’t maintain the business playing 1-2 games a month 
[12:11] <darksydephil> it would be even worse than it is now 

[12:12] <darksydephil> condo is in the process of being short sold, meaning my credit will be fucked for years 




but it'll be around $1500 im not pissing away monthly 
[12:12] <darksydephil> the condo isn’t sold lol 
[12:12] <darksydephil> detractors are fucking retards 

[12:12] <darksydephil> its' in a short sale process, the bank that holds the mortgage might tell me to fuck off 
[12:13] <darksydephil> but it needs to happen, there's no way i can piss away that money anymore and my aunt 
moved out some 6 months ago 

[12:13] <darksydephil> yeah myc redit will be shit for a few years 

[12:14] <darksydephil> um no. existing loans and car insurance don't go up lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> they can’t actually 

[12:14] <darksydephil> im getting a downgraded MUCH cheaper car soon anyway 
[12:14] <darksydephil> i didn’t threaten machinima?? 

[12:15] <darksydephil> the fuck is that idiot talking about haha 
[12:15] <darksydephil> aglet im well aware of this 

[12:15] <darksydephil> when we get the car i’ll probably have to go used and do a cosign with leanna. no way 
just my credit is giong to fly 

[12:15] <darksydephil> i can't get the car yet be im stuck with teh bmw until june whent he lease expires 
[12:15] <darksydephil> and i can't afford 2 car payments at once 
[12:16] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> are you an idiot? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> i literally never threatened machinima. you're a complete moron 

[12:18] <darksydephil> that guy was so dumb, his attention span was so bad, he thought i was talking about 

machinima instead of youtube 

[12:18] <darksydephil> i mean holy crap 

[12:18] <darksydephil> that's proven stupidity there 

[12:19] <darksydephil> of course 

[12:19] <darksydephil> i went from guaranteed income based on views to a fluctuating income based on ad 
revenue, its awful 

[12:19] <darksydephil> and machinima has the best terms! Thats the funniest part, im making mor ewith them 
than i would anywhere else 

[12:19] <darksydephil> i alreayd looked into it, nobody else even compares 

[12:21] <darksydephil> Machinima has clout with YouTube, numerous times they've helped clear up copyright 
issues and other stuff fo rme 

[12:21] <darksydephil> and because im with machinima i do NOT get any issues with copyrigth matches or 
content ID. that's a HUGE one 

[12:22] <darksydephil> if i just uploaded without being in a managed partnership, half of my videos would get 
content ID matched and no ads would show 

[12:22] <darksydephil> its not copyright issues, its content ID. completely different 

[12:23] <darksydephil> wtf, i literally just said machinima has the BEST contract lol. how can you say it sucks 
[14:26] <darksydephil> wow machinima responded 

[14:27] <darksydephil> i was 100% correct, it seems youtube has fucked up 
[14:27] <darksydephil> and machinima is looking into it because its completely unfair 

[14:27] <darksydephil> youtube lowered my ad revenue percentage fro no reason at all. theres no evidence they 
even reviewed my channel, they just did it out of nowhere 

[14:27] <darksydephil> its NOT across the board, apparently it was just me or else everyone would have been 
screaming 

[14:28] <darksydephil> machinima says they agree with me 100% and are doing what they can w/youtube to 
figure thi sout 

[14:28] <darksydephil> so, this is good news 
[14:41] <darksydephil> i have no fucking luck 


#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170224 NO STREAM, PLUMBER VISIT FOR SINK.LOG 




-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170225-01 NIOH 15TH FINALE.LOG 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:51] <darksydephil> i have returned from a day of crappy sink repairs 
[11:51] <darksydephil> it was a thrilling experience lol 

[11:51] <darksydephil> they needed to use a power saw to chop off the old faucet be it was so old and rusted on 
[11:52] <darksydephil> no lie lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> thats what happens with 20 year old leaky plumbing 
[11:52] <darksydephil> and no, that was standard cost, i looked it up 

[11:52] <darksydephil> standard plumber cost to repair a faucet is around 300 bucks, to replace is 500. i thinkt 
he 300 is the fucking ripoff, all they do is tighten shit 

[11:53] <darksydephil> at least here they tore the old one out and gave me a nice new one 
[11:53] <darksydephil> delta, did you not hear what i just said 

[11:53] <darksydephil> the faucet was 20 years old and RUSTED ON to the sink, you need power tools to even 
touch it 

[11:54] <darksydephil> i was watching what they were doing and it wasn’t super complicated, but you do need to 

knwo what everythign is and have the right tools for the job 

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170226-01 TWITCH & CHILL 201702.LOG 

[11:49] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:49] <darksydephil> hows everybody today? 

[11:50] <darksydephil> im hyped for today but very cold, i left the window open in my office and its a good 10 
degrees colder in here than the res of the house lol 

[11:51] <darksydephil> i figure we'll start with jackbox pack 3 be we started with that last time and it was 
honestly the best of all of them 

[11:55] <darksydephil> so ive got an update regarding tshirts 

[11:55] <darksydephil> so far ive got 2 really solid submissions that im giong to use and 2 more people are 

working on artwork at the moment, so ill have 4-5 shirts when i launch the teespring 

[11:56] <darksydephil> ok gonna move the mic over to the PC and then get the stream started 

[11:56] <darksydephil> today has been slow so far, not much going on. sucks theres no updates from machinima 

all weekend because netiehr YT nor machinima work weekends...but whatever lol 

[11:57] <darksydephil> my profit continues to be next to nothing on a daily basis according to machinima's 
console calculator thing 

[11:57] <darksydephil> so this had better get fixed 

[11:57] <darksydephil> no lie, right now i haven't even made half as much in february as i did in January, and 
january was low as everyone knows.... 

[11:57] <darksydephil> im pretty nervous about the whole thing 
[11:58] <darksydephil> i cant Derichloveslemur , the beta ended 
[11:58] <darksydephil> i actually wanted to this weekend lol 
[11:59] <darksydephil> tyholmes thats the plan 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i already have 2 people lined up, and a bunch of cancidates for #3 
[11:59] <darksydephil> candidates 
[11:59] <darksydephil> they are tyholmes? 

[11:59] <darksydephil> not the same campaign at all? 

[12:00] <darksydephil> yeah i can tell its the kind of game you need friends for 
[12:02] <darksydephil> stream working or no? 

[12:03] <darksydephil> ok ill refresh then, i cant see it 

[12:03] <darksydephil> itll be jackbox to start, then choice chamber, then maybe end with more jackbox 
[12:03] <darksydephil> there is no sound yet Derichloveslemur 
[12:03] <darksydephil> yeah ill type the code in chat 

[12:04] <darksydephil> i have no idea how to do subs only and i didnt announce it as such so that wouldnt’ be 
very fair 

[12:04] <darksydephil> OK stream working now for me 




[12:05] <darksydephil> ok let me bring the mic over 

[12:15] <darksydephil> ill be posting teh links in the stream chat since thats what people seem to want 

[12:15] <darksydephil> Bill Paxton was a great actor 

[12:15] <darksydephil> sucks he died so young, well not YOUNG but still 

[12:16] <darksydephil> i hated tee ko, fuck that game 

[12:30] <darksydephil> UFJO 

[12:55] <darksydephil> the code is OEWIRJEPRJPOEWJROIEWJROIEWJROEWJROEWJR Just kidding! the 

code is really IIPR 

[13:24] <darksydephil> aknk 

[13:39] <darksydephil> abtx 

[14:03] <darksydephil> the fact people apparently took a random twitter joke post and turned it into a detractor 
meme is actually quite terrifying 

[14:03] <darksydephil> i have no idea what the reference is though 

[14:04] <darksydephil> Drilbit777 rumors of waht? i still dont know wtf it has to do with anything lol 
[14:05] <darksydephil> what is buying a crap ring? im totally lost here 

[14:05] <darksydephil> of course leanna wants to get married, all women who are with guys for years want to 
get married lol 

[14:06] <darksydephil> there is no "fake ring" so i guess these morons took a random tweet meant as a joke and 
took it as fact, which is pretty much what they do all the time anyway, spin shit because they're fucking 
braindead idiots 

[14:08] <darksydephil> the links you're posting go to her latest twitter post, not anything pertinent lol 
[14:09] <darksydephil> feeding into what? i dont care, im just interested in what stupid shit they spun into a 
meme for themselves lol 

[14:09] <darksydephil> like the "phil dated leanna when she was underage" meme 
[14:09] <darksydephil> curiosity at wtf theyre talking about is the action they want? lol 
[14:10] <darksydephil> working on the nioh reveiw tomorrow night 
[14:11] <darksydephil> wait...you're serious? THAT's the post? HAHAHAH 
[14:12] <darksydephil> thats a crappy fake ring she bought for like a buck somewhere 
[14:12] <darksydephil> and these idiots spun this into something? 

[14:12] <darksydephil> they're THAT fucking retarded? holy crap, it's worse than i thought 
[14:12] <darksydephil> dude, they just ruined the finale of quiplash with that awful inside joke lol 
[14:12] <darksydephil> nobody would get it bu tthem 

[14:14] <darksydephil> it points to a joke tweet that i never saw and is obviously a fucking joke tweet, from 
august of last year, that they spun into some kind of insult about tension ni our relationship and then they sprung 
it at the conclusion of a game of quiplash in february 2017 AND THEN ALL VOTED FOR IT TO WIN as 
audience members despite it not having the word lick in it. want an example of mental deficiency? YOU JUST 
GOT IT! 

[14:14] <darksydephil> i'm not making it worse, im laughing histerically right now lolol 
[14:15] <darksydephil> ok im going to piss, then we'll play choice chamber 

[14:15] <darksydephil> i have officially fell into the black hole of the mentally stupid and i need out 

[15:07] <darksydephil> since gino was just going to type that in a circle 

[15:07] <darksydephil> he can be timed ou tnow 

[15:07] <darksydephil> idiot 

[15:07] <darksydephil> ok here comes the code 

[15:07] <darksydephil> wdsr 

[15:09] <darksydephil> gfvy 

[15:36] <darksydephil> xgna 

[15:56] <darksydephil> ebwq 

[16:19] <darksydephil> i can't play BOTW on friday as it wont arrive in time, im going to do a live unboxing of 
the swtich, hook it up, mess with it for a couple of hours 
[16:19] <darksydephil> then all day saturdya is BOTW 
[16:20] <darksydephil> i closed the game? 



[16:20] <darksydephil> wtf 
[16:20] <darksydephil> lol 

[16:22] <darksydephil> that was a great stream except for the ring "insult" that made absolutely no sense lol 
[16:23] <darksydephil> yeah at this point we need more games 

[16:23] <darksydephil> that was fun but another time w/the same stuff would be boring i think 
[16:23] <darksydephil> i dunno what else would work well 

[16:25] <darksydephil> i dunno, generic board games are fun to play but not to watch i dont think 

[16:25] <darksydephil> plus in a game hike monopoly, the trolls would jsut constantly reject any trades id want 

to do and fuck me over, it woudl get boring really quick 

[16:26] <darksydephil> just like choice chamber today, okay, first 10 minutes are fun, but not when you jsut troll 
and i can't progress, it ruins it 

[16:26] <darksydephil> sucks be i really like choice chamber but i apparently can never play it ever again 
[16:27] <darksydephil> iluvtitsl if you didnt notice, even the patrons only game had 2 trolls, i know for a fact 
some of them pledge for stuff just like this 

[16:27] <darksydephil> gladefinder i played 2 of them for youtube 
[16:27] <darksydephil> i like how i was outtrolling the trolls lol 

[16:28] <darksydephil> fireball island? or forbidden bridge? both had volcanoes i think 
[16:28] <darksydephil> it wasn't deleted??? 

[16:28] <darksydephil> i made it public again in january 

[16:29] <darksydephil> dude use this link: https://thekingofhate.com/playlists/ 

[16:29] <darksydephil> use that to search for any playlist of any game ive ever played 
[16:29] <darksydephil> it's an amazing resource that nobody uses 
[16:30] <darksydephil> nice! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170227-01 YAKUZA 0 9TH.LOG 

[10:53] <darksydephil> hello all 

[10:54] <darksydephil> good to see so many here early! 

[10:54] <darksydephil> i doubt we’ll be getting many today for yakuza 0 but hey 
[10:54] <darksydephil> enough already 
[10:54] <darksydephil> i jsut fucking got here 
[10:54] <darksydephil> idiot 

[10:55] <darksydephil> just another waste of a space on earth 
[10:55] <darksydephil> like there aren't enough of us lol 
[10:56] <darksydephil> no updates yet, its not even 1 lam here 
[10:56] <darksydephil> more than likely they're just getting to work 
[10:56] <darksydephil> that viking cheer is from yesdterday? 

[10:56] <darksydephil> hes not here cheering yet right lol 
[10:57] <darksydephil> ok thanks 
[10:57] <darksydephil> resetting it 

[10:57] <darksydephil> ok let me set stuff up brb, then stream will start 

[11:04] <darksydephil> from what i saw, they handed warren beatty the wrong envelope, it was again the best 

actress envelope and he looked at the card like WTF, this says einma stone for lala land 

[11:04] <darksydephil> and then they just said la la land thinking it was a misprint o rsomething 

[11:04] <darksydephil> then someone found the right envelope lol 

[11:05] <darksydephil> its jsut stupid human error and people being lazy, not checking wtf they'r edoing. it 
happens 

[11:05] <darksydephil> just like how in the tribute to those who died this year they had a picture of a woman 
who's still alive lol! 

[11:05] <darksydephil> yes 

[11:05] <darksydephil> they're morons 

[11:05] <darksydephil> they got the name right but used a pic of one of the woman's IRL friends who is also in 
the industry because nobody fact checked anything 




[11:06] <darksydephil> stream is starting momentarily 
[11:06] <darksydephil> setting it up nwo 
[11:06] <darksydephil> now 

[11:07] <darksydephil> lets hope obs doesn’t fuck up again 

[11:07] <darksydephil> i have no idea hwat happened with the week in preview last night 
[11:08] <darksydephil> first time that's ever happened 

[11:12] <darksydephil> gotta love the net tards out there, every video is now getting spammed with comments 
saying "advertiser unfriendly!" despite Machinima blatantly saying that's not what the issue is with ads on 
dspgaming. 

[11:12] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i didn’t make a video saying that rosefox911 , what the fuck are you talking about? 
[11:14] <darksydephil> did you even LISTEN to the video or just watch someone else lie about what it said? 
[11:14] <darksydephil> no, i did not 
[11:15] <darksydephil> wow 

[11:15] <darksydephil> some of you REALLY, REALLY weren’t listening to the video at all. that's shockingly 
bad 

[11:16] <darksydephil> like, you have to be moronic to get that out of the video when i outright said "machinima 
says it is NOT this" 

[11:16] <darksydephil> now i understand where all the misinformation about me comes from, just blatantly 
dumb people lol 

[11:18] <darksydephil> ok stream is live, ill head to the loveseat and we’ll get started 
[11:19] <darksydephil> soulrider95 perhaps you should watch the week in preview OR ready my twitter 
schedule instead of spamming hte stream chat for schedule info that's publicly available for a week now 
[11:19] <darksydephil> book smart doesn’t equate to actual human intelligence rosefox911 , that's obvious from 
your personal case lol 

[11:20] <darksydephil> thats definitely who i want coding my business, a guy who watches a vlog and gets the 
exact OPPOSITE info out of it than what it actually said, what a fucking moron 

[11:21] <darksydephil> coffeemode, there is no mistake here as that's never happened, its a per video basis, not 

an entire channel basis, and there's a notification process as well, you're making shit up 

[11:23] <darksydephil> whoops 

[11:23] <darksydephil> that was a misclick 

[11:23] <darksydephil> my fault 

[11:23] <darksydephil> i was moving the stream chat and it clicked the damn thing 
[11:23] <darksydephil> i think it only timed him out 

[11:23] <darksydephil> ok prestream time, tell him i apologized as that was a mistake 

[12:43] <darksydephil> of Nioh could do 60fps, so can From Software, its lazy game development at this point 
to not do it. Nioh was a MUCH better game for having it 

[13:13] <darksydephil> nobody will buy the pro controlle rat htat price, stores are going to have shelves 
overflowing with stock nboody buys on all of those fucking accesorries lol 

[13:14] <darksydephil> the pro controller is "sold out" by the early adopter idiots like every piece of new tech, 
give it a month for the actual waves of stock to hit shelves 

[13:24] <darksydephil> nobody will be playing nor talking about for honor in anohter 2 weeks, the game has no 
traction like Overwatch did 

[14:53] <darksydephil> "you rage quit MANY games" So you're a moron who can't count then? I've finished 
hundreds, maybe "rage quit" a dozen or two. probably like a 5% margin, fuck off dumbass 
[14:57] <darksydephil> no, it's 95% chance to those with mor ethan 5 IQ who can do basic math, you stupid 
monkey 

[14:58] <darksydephil> he flew straight into the sewage drain 
[14:58] <darksydephil> where he fucking belongs 
[14:59] <darksydephil> i just hate stupidity 

[14:59] <darksydephil> there's trolling, that's one thing, but that guy was literally braindead 
[14:59] <darksydephil> just another body on the planet that won’t do a damn productive thing lol 



[15:13] <darksydephil> just gotta use the right fighting styles and combos, shit is OP lol 
[15:13] <darksydephil> i havent lost to a single boss yet 

[15:39] <darksydephil> i siad human erection, the character from this very game 
[15:39] <darksydephil> not inner erection lol 

[16:02] <darksydephil> LOL they're selling a version of Horizon ZD for 10 bucks more on PSN 
[16:03] <darksydephil> what do you get? 

[16:03] <darksydephil> a few in games items and a digital art book, for 10 dollars, no die content 
[16:03] <darksydephil> uuuh, how about fuck no 
[16:03] <darksydephil> digital deluxe 

[16:04] <darksydephil> its just a few packs of in game weapons/armor and stuff 
[16:04] <darksydephil> not even fair to have it, its pay to win lol 

[16:04] <darksydephil> if it were giving me DLC missions i would have considered it. but not just items you 
dont need 

[16:05] <darksydephil> thats fucking dumb

[10:56] <darksydephil> hello all 

[10:56] <darksydephil> setting up now

[11:06] <darksydephil> waht the fuck 

[11:06] <darksydephil> why are you believing this? 

[11:06] <darksydephil> i said in the vlog that is NOT THE CASE 
[11:08] <darksydephil> oh my god. how could people be so braindead 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i said, in the video, that machinima confirmed that was NOT the case, that was the 
purpose of me even bringing it up 

[11:09] <darksydephil> angelus, i dont even know how to react to these people anymore lol 
[11:09] <darksydephil> intelligent people aren’t confused burnout26 
[11:09] <darksydephil> they actually listen and comprehend a sentiment 

[11:10] <darksydephil> when i have info to share ont his subject, ill share it. there’s no reason for rampant 

speculation when there's no actual concrete info to share on anything 

[11:10] <darksydephil> and the spreading of Misinformation will no be tolerated 

[11:11] <darksydephil> okay ill twet that we're live 

[11:16] <darksydephil> ok prestream is abou tto start 

[11:16] <darksydephil> however
