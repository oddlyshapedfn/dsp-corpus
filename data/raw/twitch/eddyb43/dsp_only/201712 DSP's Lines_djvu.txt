[11:25] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:26] <darksydephil> so im just going to start using the 2 out of 3 new Christmas animations i have 

[11:26] <darksydephil> seems dr zombius hit a snag finishing the last one 

[11:26] <darksydephil> and i dont want to hold off when i have 2 already 

[11:31] <darksydephil> whoops i forgot to play the music 

[11:38] <darksydephil> i dont think so 

[11:39] <darksydephil> well it's a beta, if they dont work i can report it 

[11:41] <darksydephil> okay i just tweeted out the stream 

[11:42] <darksydephil> i completed the story like a month ago lol 

[11:43] <darksydephil> yes, thats right 

[11:43] <darksydephil> repeat that like a parrot 

[11:43] <darksydephil> proves how smart you are lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> i seriously wonder about people who mindlessly repeat shit 

[11:44] <darksydephil> like, do you constantly need napkins to wipe the drool off your mouth? lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> you do realize that mindlessly repeating meaningless memes shows low intelligence, 






right? 

[11:45] <darksydephil> there's no bait here 

[11:45] <darksydephil> it's just an observation 

[11:45] <darksydephil> AdmiralPrawn is exactly right 

[11:45] <darksydephil> and the stuff they repeat doesn’t even make sense 

[11:46] <darksydephil> they just repeat it to be part of something 

[11:46] <darksydephil> it's the epitome of being a mindless, drooling idiot 

[11:46] <darksydephil> no, this is about the dumb shit people repeat about me that makes no sense lol 
[11:46] <darksydephil> "i prefer a penne" huh? 

[11:47] <darksydephil> you literally took something random i said on a prestream and turned it into a 
meaningless meme 

[11:47] <darksydephil> im pretty sur ei was responding to a cheer 

[11:47] <darksydephil> like someone asked me if i had a preference of pasta 

[11:47] <darksydephil> and i said i liked pasta that was easy to get with your fork be some of them are a pain in 
the ass and splash sauce 

[11:48] <darksydephil> so...how does that turn into a pointless meme? see what i’m saying, it's mindless

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171204-02 NFS PAYBACK 11TH.LOG 

[19:33] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:33] <darksydephil> just adding vids to playlist, then we’ll get started 

[21:44] <darksydephil> skumbaghorse what in the hell are you talking about, don’t you see the people taking 
here 

[21:44] <darksydephil> talking 

[21:44] <darksydephil> stop talking shit like that moron 
[21:44] <darksydephil> okay then 

[23:03] <darksydephil> yeah John was great for improv comedy, some of the best reactions/comebacks to stuff 
that we did 







[23:08] <darksydephil> i honestly dunno if my getting into a relationship is what led to my friendship with John 
decaying, I mean, we still did stuff regularly even when I was dating her, before I moved that is. I just think he 
might of been looking for way more in the friendship, while I thought he was really enjoying gaming weekly, but 
in reality I don’t think he really did enjoy it and was only doing it for the money after the first 1-2 years 
[23:09] <darksydephil> I could definitely tell his attitude changed, like when we started he was amped to play 
anything, but by 2012 it was more like "yeah i’ll just play whatever you set up" 

[23:10] <darksydephil> well yeah, he started coming by weekly in late 2010 when i got laid off. then when he 
lost his job in 2011 i started paying him weekly for the stuff he was in 

[23:10] <darksydephil> i honestly think he didn't enjoy it much but just kept doing it to make money be he 
needed the money bad 

[23:11] <darksydephil> yeah he definitely was a great part of everything for those first few years, 2010-2013 
[23:11] <darksydephil> exactly 

[23:12] <darksydephil> as soon as Project 7 fell apart it seems thats when ALL the resentment started toward me 
in 2012, but nobody actually told me about it 

[23:12] <darksydephil> so John kept showing up to play and take a paycheck but really didn’t care that much, 
only wanted to do his Holepunch stuff 

[23:12] <darksydephil> sad be if anybody has just told me what was going on, i would have taken care of it 
immediately, but i never knew any o fit 

[23:13] <darksydephil> that shit is long in the past now Gutty lol 

[23:15] <darksydephil> if they’d actually had any real interest in talking, they would have. I was the one 
messaging them for a year and not getting any responses. THey made zero effort to ever talk to me about any of 
it, then made that video 2 years ago. When you ignore someone for a year and then make a public video to slam 
them instead of just talking to them, that means you have no legitimate interest in actually keeping a friendship 
[23:15] <darksydephil> they knew what they were doing, that video 100% severed them from me and my 
content, which is obviously what they wanted: to stop being bothered/pestered by fans asking why they weren’t 
doing shit with me 

[23:19] <darksydephil> AssBlastor : that's what you call "covering yourself' as in, acting like there was an open 
door. He says "the lines are open" bug IGNORED me for a year straight, so obviously there were no open lines. 
Again, I had messaged him a dozen times and gotten no responses. There was no open line of dialogue, he’d 
blatantly ignored me on purpose 

[23:20] <darksydephil> and yeah, John made that Patreon parody video at the same time he was totally ignoring 
me 

[23:20] <darksydephil> so he was insulting me before he’d even revealed something wsa wrong to anybody 
[23:21] <darksydephil> Straight up, Howard got mad be he thought he was gonna make bank off of Project 7 lol 
[23:21] <darksydephil> Ass Blastor he ignored me for almost a year? that was a long camping trip haha 
[23:23] <darksydephil> I know. It really is a shame it ended, be TONS of game are full online co-op now. It 
would have been an amazing opportunity to continue doing what we were doing, even with Smark Guys which 
could have continued over an online podcast. But that was John's choice 

[23:23] <darksydephil> Gutty: John got a cut since the week he lost his job at Gamestop in 2011 up until the 
final session he ever did with me. That was 3 straight years of weekly paychecks 

[23:23] <darksydephil> and I always paid him half of whatever i made on the vids, right down the middle 
[23:24] <darksydephil> then later on when it became impossible tos ee how much i made on the vids because 
reporting was fucked up, we agreed upon a set amount per visit and he was the one who asked for that amount, 
and i immediately agreed 

[23:25] <darksydephil> i also paid his way for most if not all the trips we went on, including plane tickets, hotel 
and food 

[23:25] <darksydephil> so how on earth that guy could ever complain a lick about me, i dunno. I never said a 
negative word about him and still haven't, i still feel totally blindsided and just stupefied about the whole thing 
[23:26] <darksydephil> John knows how bad that video hurt me and has made zero effort to ever contact me, talk 
about it or apologize, so yeah, there won't be any peace be it's on him to fix stuff 
[23:26] <darksydephil> gutty what?!? 

[23:26] <darksydephil> that has nothing whatsoever to do with john or howard lol 



[23:27] <darksydephil> that was years later 

[23:28] <darksydephil> if you want my honest opinion, and this is total speculation 
[23:30] <darksydephil> i mean just listen to what he says in that video 

[23:31] <darksydephil> stuff like "Everything is shared and online" and the like. It seems like he wanted a 
disconnect, a friendship with me that was completely outside of the realm of what we put on camera, in addition 
to what we did 

[23:31] <darksydephil> what John didn’t realize is that the entire rest of my life was filming my solo stuff, it 
wasn’t like I had massive free time and was just hanging out with other friends. I was full-on in YouTube mode 
to make money when the money was great. But John took resentment from that 

[23:32] <darksydephil> in a lot of ways, the YouTube life hurt a ton of shit. My friendships with John and 
Howard, and my relationship with Leanna. it's a rough life for sure 

[23:33] <darksydephil> no see Gutty, to HIM I think that's how he felt. That's not how I felt at all. I saw it as a 
friend is coming over to chill and have fun, and FUCK, we’re lucky enouhg to make money while we do it too! 
[23:33] <darksydephil> even i didn’t have youtube i would have wanted him to come over and hang every week, 
but i dont think he felt that way, he just thought it was for the money 

[23:34] <darksydephil> at first i dont think he saw it like that either as i wasn't paying him, but as soon as i 
started making money and paying him, i do think his attitude changed 

[23:36] <darksydephil> I'll also be totally honest here, I think John resented the fact that my YouTube stuff did 
well and his didn’t do nearly as well. He clearly thought the stuff he put out on his channel was better than just 
the gameplay on mine, but he barely ever made any money on it despite the tons of hard work that was put forth 
to create it 

[23:36] <darksydephil> so it's hard to not start resenting someone when they are making bank doing something 
you view as lower quality/easier than what you're doing, but what you're doing isn't getting popular 
[23:37] <darksydephil> look at John’s early stuff: gameplay. It blew up huge, he was getting tons of views. He 
told me he didn’t want to do it anymore but instead start podcasts and series, and those didn’t take off like the 
gameplay 

[23:37] <darksydephil> and hell, don’t get started on Holepunch which he worked his ass off on for over a year 
and it got next to no attention 

[23:37] <darksydephil> even with promotion at conventions that we went to 

[23:41] <darksydephil> reaction videos are not only completely worthless tripe, they get demonetized, i have to 
focus on streaming and gameplay related projects, nothing that's going to be heavily edited and then just 
demonetized on a whim by youtube 

[23:44] <darksydephil> thats why i’m done with edited reviews and the like, it really sucks, but look at how well 

things are doing with streams. Twitch is where it's at right now, i’d be completely nuts to focus on a YouTube 

edited series at this point 

[23:45] <darksydephil> sure infinite 

[23:46] <darksydephil> yes it is 

[23:46] <darksydephil> its the morons 

[23:47] <darksydephil> they've tried every possible thing to tear me down and none of it has worked, so now 
they attack people who support me 

[23:48] <darksydephil> when SWATing, DDOS attacks, mass slander and hate, TIHYDP, false reports to 
youtube, twitch and anyone i try to work with business-wise, reporting me for tax evasion/fraud, signing me up 
for mass amounts of physical junkmail AND junk e-mail to my public internet addresses all fail, they have to try 
something else, so they attack the fans 

[23:48] <darksydephil> its been happening on Twitter for years 

[23:48] <darksydephil> only recently has it come over to Twitch since now people cheer/sub/tip etc 
[23:48] <darksydephil> if you get threatened, immediately report it to twitch 
[23:49] <darksydephil> a 24 hour stream would be insanely bad for me 
[23:49] <darksydephil> i already live a sedentary livestyle 

[23:49] <darksydephil> now imagine barely moving for 24 hours, id get a blood clot 

[23:50] <darksydephil> i would actually have to start working out for like 3 months prior to attempting any 

really lengthy stream 



[23:50] <darksydephil> my voice is shot as it is, no lie 
[23:51] <darksydephil> i really need this break this week 

[23:51] <darksydephil> talking 5-9 hours a day kills the throat, its not normal human behavior 

[23:52] <darksydephil> if i ever did a crazy long stream it would probably be for charity, at least it would be 

worth it then 

[23:52] <darksydephil> but sadly i always find myself in fucked situations wehre i can’t even do charity be my 
own finances are so fucked 

[23:52] <darksydephil> i honestly still cannot believe the current tax situation, i paid a guy thousands of bucks to 
make sure my shit was straight for years only to find he fucked me. unbelieveable 

[23:54] <darksydephil> theres no point to suing the guy, i can only sue for the fees/penalties and interest which 
at most will probably only be a few thousand, just filing the lawsuit is more expensive lol 
[23:54] <darksydephil> it would be one thing if i were rich and doing it on principle, but that's not the case here 
[23:55] <darksydephil> yeah, the guy should have immediately just said "get a tax attorney in Washington" when 
i asked him in 2014. that was totally fucked up that he told me not to 

[23:56] <darksydephil> MiraiMisaki: wealth isn't defined as how much you make, it's defined as how much you 
keep, i keep nothing, therefore, i'm poor lol 

[23:56] <darksydephil> i had backup savings, they all went bye bye over 2015-2016 when my youtube income 
decreased by 66% 

[23:57] <darksydephil> it wasn't until this year when twitch became a major moneymaking factor that i stopped 
"bleeding out" per say 

[23:57] <darksydephil> i never had any money to invest, any money i had was saved up for like 1-2 years and 
then i moved here, spending it all 

[23:58] <darksydephil> MiraiMisaki : hindsight is 20/20. When i moved in 2014 I was making way more money, 
and if things had stayed at that level I never would have even needed to get a Patreon. Look how shit on 
YouTUbe has totally collapsed since then, nobody knew that would happen 

[23:58] <darksydephil> I love how when im in immediate financial crisis, people start asking about retirement lol 
[23:59] <darksydephil> let me tell you something: if you have the opportunity to plan on retirement, you're 
incredibly lucky and should be counting your blessings 

[00:00] <darksydephil> moving in any way, shape or form would be incredibly difficult, i live alone, how do i 
pack up an entire house? sell all the shit that can't be moved? i’d have to somehow figure out all of that stuff by 
myself WHILE still streaming full time, i can barely just do the streaming now 
[00:01] <darksydephil> okay im out of here, time to watch RAW and unwind a bit

[11:35] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:35] <darksydephil> got some great news today folks 

[11:35] <darksydephil> yes, the Patreon backlash has totally destroyed their bullshit 
[11:35] <darksydephil> and they are not doing the changes 

[11:35] <darksydephil> so many people lost tons of Patrons over it they had to backpedal 

[11:36] <darksydephil> so this might save the MGS goal, which honestly i was pretty scared about especially be 

i really need the help this month 

[11:38] <darksydephil> maybe, just maybe, you can stop with that stupid shit lol 

[11:38] <darksydephil> im not playing it on hard mode, and anyone who demands that is a moron, sorry, it's just 
true 

[11:38] <darksydephil> i need to play the game for real once before i go on extra challenging runs 
[11:38] <darksydephil> thats like saying well Phil played Dark Souls once, so play it on hard the second time 
[11:39] <darksydephil> the option is stupid, so stop stating it 

[11:40] <darksydephil> mujtabal2321 : of course that now lies on the creators, which isn’t fair 
[11:40] <darksydephil> i already lost a few 
[11:40] <darksydephil> not too many luckily 

[11:40] <darksydephil> by the way, since i've heard this game runs like utter shit on xbox one, im only recording 
in 30 fps lol 

[11:41] <darksydephil> doing good, about to start the stream right now 

[11:42] <darksydephil> the game is apparently a huge mess, which isn't surprising considering the game was 
never even optimized on PC 

[11:42] <darksydephil> quite frankly im not expecting much from this game, but SO MANY people jump on the 
bandwagon that i'm checking it out regardless 

[11:43] <darksydephil> no, it doesn't even run fine on PC. ive heard from tons of people who play it that it 
constantly has issues even on high end rigs 

[11:43] <darksydephil> BlackTemplar2252 i get the feeling you listen to the wrong people 

[11:45] <darksydephil> Will it be PlayerUnknown's amazing sleeper hit or PlayerUnknown's turd sandwich? 

FIND OUT TODAY! 

[11:46] <darksydephil> 2.5 months of dust, last game i played on xbone was Cuphead. the entire dashboard 
system is different now, it looks like xbox 360 again haha 

[11:46] <darksydephil> it took them like 5 years to realize that their overly complicated awful dashboard was 
shit and nobody liked it 





[11:47] <darksydephil> are we live and stream working fine all? 

[11:47] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:51] <darksydephil> the game is unoptimized and unfinished everywhere, so you cant really blame hardware 
here, why even release it on a console they know cant handle it? answer: greed.

[19:39] <darksydephil> by the way, my first match of Star Wars today was content ID matched as i expected lol. 
the stupid game update undid my sound settings and played the damn star wars soundtrack and boom, no more 
revenue for me 

[19:43] <darksydephil> Major Nelson was playing PUBG on xbox one like crazy and only got 3rd so far lol 
[19:43] <darksydephil> pretty crazy i won my 2nd game ever, i dont think anybody else will top that 
[19:43] <darksydephil> and with zero kills haha 
[19:44] <darksydephil> actually they didnt 

[19:44] <darksydephil> one killed the other, and the blue wall killed the other guy 
[19:44] <darksydephil> you can clearly see it in the vid haha

[11:33] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:33] <darksydephil> we’re up to 298 subs again, very nice 

[11:33] <darksydephil> thats amazing considering the 20-30 "fake" subs from October are long gone, we legit 
earned them now! 

[11:34] <darksydephil> okay stream going live in a sec 

[11:35] <darksydephil> its going alright, i kind of feel bad that this playthrough isn't looking good to continue, 






considering the vids on youtube have like 100 views each 

[11:35] <darksydephil> but i have to do what's best to keep my house, ya know 

[11:35] <darksydephil> maybe, as like a shorter stream 

[11:35] <darksydephil> we’ll have to see what happens 

[11:36] <darksydephil> it certainly can't be a focus unless things pick up today bigtime 

[11:36] <darksydephil> like i said, Zelda BOTW was a similar situation but people really showed up and were 

cheering/subbing/tipping constantly so it made up for it. that didn’t happen with the first okami stream at least 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171218-01 FIGHTING EX LAYER BETA 2ND.LOG 

[11:32] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:34] <darksydephil> wtf is going on with these hardwrae errors 
[11:34] <darksydephil> poor kekon 

[11:34] <darksydephil> and it says he's playing fortnite haha 

[11:35] <darksydephil> this is like the 5th major train wreck since i moved 

[11:35] <darksydephil> seems like the train infrastructure in the USA is falling apart 

[11:37] <darksydephil> i cant believe that one fucking guy from last session who obviously had his internet 

fucked so the match wuld slow down 

[11:37] <darksydephil> what a turd he was 

[11:37] <darksydephil> amtrak was actually good on the east coast, it was WAY better than the other Metro 
North lines 

[11:37] <darksydephil> more reliable and more comfortable 

[11:38] <darksydephil> seriously this sucks atlastelamon9 be that was a major tourist rail and i hoped to take it 
some day 

[11:38] <darksydephil> rather than drive down there which would take forever 
[11:40] <darksydephil> kozatof, are you a moron? 

[11:40] <darksydephil> sorry i have to ask, because you seem to think there actually is an "escort lady" lol 
[11:40] <darksydephil> no shit, sherlock 

[11:41] <darksydephil> escort lady is a detractor catfish account, it's only insanely obvious if you actually read 
like, 2 tweets 

[11:42] <darksydephil> this dark souls remix is amazing, the video is even better, and it has less than lk views 
on youtube 

[11:42] <darksydephil> youtube is seriously total shit these days 

[11:42] <darksydephil> people watch the dumbest of the dumb stuff and ignore quality 

[11:45] <darksydephil> kozatof, there are about 20 songs that always play in the same order 

[11:45] <darksydephil> just because you dont always hear the ones you like doesn't mean they dont play, it just 

means you miss them 

[11:48] <darksydephil> nobody wants to see jackbox again, i ran that game into the ground 

[11:48] <darksydephil> and nobody wants detractor shit on Christmas 

[11:48] <darksydephil> so, no, thats an awful idea 

[11:49] <darksydephil> ive never read a twitch dm 

[11:50] <darksydephil> since i started streaming here in 2013 

[11:50] <darksydephil> that inbox must be overflowing lol 

[11:50] <darksydephil> yes, the detractors will be donating their souls 

[11:51] <darksydephil> hilariously nintendo just advertised on twitter that the switch is magically restocked 
everywehre just in time for Christmas, you know, because there was never a shortage to begin with lol

these are good 

[19:38] <darksydephil> let's see, you insulted me as soon as i went offline with a snort, because we all know it's

[12:40] <darksydephil> flipped a burger with cheese on it? thats a bad look haha 

[12:41] <darksydephil> i wonder how an IRL stream on my phone would look, never tested the camera 
streaming capabilities, but i guarantee the battery would die in like 1 hour 
[12:42] <darksydephil> lol he broadcast his cooking as Daily Tekken 7 

[12:42] <darksydephil> yeah my laptop has a webcam but when i tried to stream from it in 2014 when i first 
moved here, itw as choppy as all hell so thats out 
[12:42] <darksydephil> damn thats a huge ass burger 

[12:47] <darksydephil> lol damn he didnt flip this thing for the longest, wonder if its burnt 
[12:49] <darksydephil> burger on toast? unacceptable 

[12:51] <darksydephil> holy fuck, that burger was super overdone on the first side hahahaha 
[12:52] <darksydephil> that side must have been nice and crunchy 
[12:52] <darksydephil> no worries, i was awful at cooking too 

[12:54] <darksydephil> lol that must have made tons of smoke since it was constantly burning the sauce 

[12:54] <darksydephil> im actually way better at cooking the things i know how to cook now. i like i make 

patties (chicken/pork/turkey) once every 2 weeks and have mastered it pretty much 

[12:57] <darksydephil> holy bricks, that first toast haha 

[12:59] <darksydephil> he flipped the burger and put the cheese underneath 

[13:00] <darksydephil> wow. thats a first haha 

[13:01] <darksydephil> um 

[13:01] <darksydephil> okay 

[13:01] <darksydephil> going to vomit, brb

[15:10] <darksydephil> are you fucking retarded? 

[15:10] <darksydephil> real escorts dont tweet about escorting 
[15:10] <darksydephil> thats literally against the code of escorting 

[15:10] <darksydephil> who the fuck would pay for an escort if they were going to publicly SAY they were paid 
to escort aftewrad? 

[15:10] <darksydephil> like really, how stupid are some of you lol 
[15:10] <darksydephil> the POINT of escort service is discretion you idiots 

[15:12] <darksydephil> its this simple, the story is 100% false and theres no facts, at all. just heresay, this twitter 
account claiming something thats blatantly false, so if you believe that, you're a moron, and i'm not going to have 
my chat overrun with talk about that nonsense

[19:45] <darksydephil> Game of Thrones was fucking terrible 
[19:45] <darksydephil> that game was literally theft 

[19:47] <darksydephil> im considering skipping telltale games from now on 

[19:47] <darksydephil> seriously, they're always disappointing now, and they release timing of episodes are 
awful, coninciding with other major releases 

[19:47] <darksydephil> no, im just not playing more Batman until htere' sa new episode 
[19:48] <darksydephil> then ill marathon it like i did life is strange, probably play it all day

[11:18] <darksydephil> wassap folks 
[11:18] <darksydephil> Merry Christmas Eve! 

[11:19] <darksydephil> yeah i tested the royal rumble 
[11:19] <darksydephil> the game dips from 60fps to 30fps 
[11:19] <darksydephil> and then it lags up 
[11:19] <darksydephil> its basically awful, they fucked it up lol 





[11:19] <darksydephil> so this should be interesting 

[11:20] <darksydephil> its been what, 10 years, they can't figure out how to have more than 6 in the rumble at a 

time without the game chugging, thats pretty impressively bad lol 

[11:24] <darksydephil> okay im going to turn on the stream, then go grab drinks 

[11:25] <darksydephil> we still have 315 subs, very nice 

[11:25] <darksydephil> maybe we can hit a new record today!

[11:49] <darksydephil> no grinches today 
[11:50] <darksydephil> wassap everyone! 

[11:50] <darksydephil> ok im getting set up now, so sorry for the delay, my Dad talked my ear off haha 
[11:52] <darksydephil> i keep getting twitch notifications that people are leaving messages on my video, but i 
dont have any videos, okay then... 

[11:53] <darksydephil> oh okay 

[11:53] <darksydephil> im sure its all nasty stuff too lol 

[11:53] <darksydephil> like anybody reads those comments 

[11:55] <darksydephil> so down to 318 subs, not bad overall, we only dipped by 2 

[11:55] <darksydephil> wassap! 

[11:55] <darksydephil> Merry Christmas all 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i got snow for Christmas, so that's nice 

[12:00] <darksydephil> testing 

[12:01] <darksydephil> work on Christmas day? no bueno 

[12:02] <darksydephil> NeoKevlar : no way she’d get the time off around Christmas for it, plus travel this time of 
year is incredibly expensive and horrendous here 
[12:02] <darksydephil> i dont 
[12:02] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> you guys remember the stuff ive done far better than i do 

[12:02] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[12:02] <darksydephil> i had it muted 

[12:03] <darksydephil> ok Christmas music now! 




[12:03] <darksydephil> sorry guys 

[12:04] <darksydephil> for a knife to fend off an intruder? 

[12:05] <darksydephil> im barely even a youtuber anymore lol 

[12:06] <darksydephil> nah YouTube ad revenue is much higher, plus a lot of peopel dont have the bandwidth to 
watch on twitch 

[12:06] <darksydephil> its why ill always need to have a backup archive somewhere, not everyone has good 
internet 

[12:06] <darksydephil> vid me is out of business 
[12:06] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:07] <darksydephil> Amazon just trademarked and patented stuff for their own VOD website 
[12:07] <darksydephil> so....possibly GGPO youtube soon 

[12:08] <darksydephil> YouTube will still exist, but it’ll be 100% garbage drama vlogs and crappy daily bullshit 
that nobody cares about, the ultimate fluff website that you can ignore and miss nothing 

[12:08] <darksydephil> everyone else will go to the amazon VOD site, its too late, theres far too much negative 
association with youtube for it to continue 

[12:09] <darksydephil> yes, thsi video will be uploaded to my vlogging channel, it'll be demonetized but 
whatever 

[12:09] <darksydephil> RoyalFan i wont' stop unless i have a reason to 

[12:09] <darksydephil> for example, if amazon does make this VOD website and the agreements only allow for 

monetization on one site, then ill have to make a choice 

[12:10] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the bathroom, then start presteram 

[12:10] <darksydephil> presteram

[11:31] <darksydephil> so FYI running update, we are at 339 subs, a few expired overnight 

[11:31] <darksydephil> but not so bad of a dip 

[11:33] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:33] <darksydephil> we ready to start? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> wassap 

[11:36] <darksydephil> going good, feeling positive today, just that im congested and waiting for the 
decongestant to kick in 

[11:36] <darksydephil> other than that, today is gonna be great, full day of streaming and releasing the 1st part 

of my year end series 

[11:36] <darksydephil> so far it is 

[11:36] <darksydephil> the problem is, it can always be charged back 
[11:36] <darksydephil> with patreon, that cant happen 

[11:37] <darksydephil> but tips, it can happen 2+ months later as i found out earlier this year 
[11:37] <darksydephil> but ive won every single dispute so far 
[11:37] <darksydephil> i sing this live, every single day 

[11:38] <darksydephil> im thinking about doing something different on Saturday, ill talk about it on prestream, 
let me know what you thi nk 

[11:38] <darksydephil> no not that, but kind of a fundraiser stream idea, ill give details in a few 

[11:41] <darksydephil> teespring is okay, on average i make like, $5-7 per item sold, but not much sells, i think 

this month i may have sold around 20 items 

[11:41] <darksydephil> so yeah, its not very significant 

[11:42] <darksydephil> ive seen some of the preliminary designs for the 10 year anniversary stuff and a few of 
them are damn good 

[11:42] <darksydephil> they look professional 

[11:43] <darksydephil> i wasnt confused, i remember, they were bugged on console for a while until they 
patched the game 

[11:43] <darksydephil> now try figuring that out while drunk lol 
[11:44] <darksydephil> so far yes i am, its great 

[11:45] <darksydephil> that new case was really refreshing and im loving redoing stuff, i think im better at 
questioning now be i kind of get it

[20:07] <darksydephil> i guarantee it’ll be demonetized as soon as i upload it tonight and i’ll have to dispute it 

[20:07] <darksydephil> youtube is demonetizing all edited vids now lol

[11:17] <darksydephil> wassap all 
[11:19] <darksydephil> im doing well thanks 

[11:19] <darksydephil> messing with muxy to see how this tip tracker bar thing works 
[11:28] <darksydephil> hmm 

[11:28] <darksydephil> soooo sadly it doesn’t look like the Muxy tips bar actually works 

[11:28] <darksydephil> no matter what date i set, it shows as over 10k in tips already received tdoay lol 

[11:32] <darksydephil> LOL this is hilarious, like its a "Feature" of muxy that they obviously never tested 

[11:32] <darksydephil> you set it to only show for five seconds and then fad away, yet it just reappears again. 

and it doesn't read the total properly at all 

[11:32] <darksydephil> what a mess 

[11:33] <darksydephil> it looks like its just going to be a manual process 

[11:33] <darksydephil> ill have to keep a running tally of tips and patreon pledges between PUBG matches 

[11:34] <darksydephil> whenever someone mentions some kim, its a nice ban for that morn haha 

[11:35] <darksydephil> apparently brownies is the new troll stuff so 

[11:36] <darksydephil> i have no idea what any story is about lol 

[11:36] <darksydephil> random people say random shit in here every day and im lost 

[11:37] <darksydephil> theres nothing on my forums?? 

[11:41] <darksydephil> LOL okay 

[11:41] <darksydephil> ive read up 

[11:41] <darksydephil> how ridiculous hahaha 

[11:42] <darksydephil> didnt i mention we made brownies in stream chat? i thought that i did but i guess i didnt, 
i was pretty sure i’d mentioned it at some point 

[11:45] <darksydephil> there is no panic here, i was just trying to figure out wtf everyone was referencing, and 

as expected, it's incredibly stupid lol 

[11:46] <darksydephil> i dont even know the real story 

[11:46] <darksydephil> i guess someone claimed an escort made me brownies 

[11:47] <darksydephil> why would i read ANY thread on kiwifarms, ever? LOL 

[11:47] <darksydephil> there is no leak, there is a DM convo from twitter about brownies, thats not a "leak" LOL 
[11:48] <darksydephil> im almost positive i mentioned my GF making me brownies in here on a prestream, but i 
have no actual idea, someone would have to go watch all the prestreams haha 
[11:49] <darksydephil> this could be the dumbest thing ever lol 
[11:49] <darksydephil> Shadysands89 : thats pretty much it 

[11:51] <darksydephil> all right, so now that i know whats going on, ill start the stream and i guess ill address it? 
its so dumb it doesn't matter and the people who "believe" wont bet swayed but i guess ill explain anyway 
[11:55] <darksydephil> I’d mentioned brownies on a prestream or in stream chat, i'm sure of it 
[11:59] <darksydephil> actually the cookies i made WERE exactly like brownies on the inside, but they were 
still called cookies 

[12:00] <darksydephil> how about this 
[12:00] <darksydephil> everybody relax 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ill actually talk about this stupidity in a sec here 





[12:00] <darksydephil> just let me take a piss and we’ll start 
[12:02] <darksydephil> the prestream is going to be stupid as hell 
[12:02] <darksydephil> this whole thing is just dumb kiddie shit

[11:32] <darksydephil> so you’re super gullible then? lol 

[11:32] <darksydephil> first off, escorts don't have public twitter accounts, because escorting is a DISCREET 
PROFESSION, as in, when you have one, you don’t want the world to know, and you don’t want the girl 
blabbing about it 

[11:33] <darksydephil> how would you like that to be your dick in one of the videos? 

[11:33] <darksydephil> there were two "Escorts" who were catfishing everyone in my stream chat back when i 
used twitch in 2013/2014 and it turned out they were fake accounts, despite having all this evidence and history, 
people are just fucking stupid 

[11:34] <darksydephil> Powerhourpodcast: thats how catfishing works lol 

[11:34] <darksydephil> Nich2440 : because some people are dumb as rocks apparently 

[11:35] <darksydephil> i dont even know wtf an exotic bread is lol! 

[11:38] <darksydephil> me ree enough, stop talking about it be i dont care and im not going to have the entire 

discussion around it

[11:53] <darksydephil> dont make me check logs 

[11:53] <darksydephil> okay well
