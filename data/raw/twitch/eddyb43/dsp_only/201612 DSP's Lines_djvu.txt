#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161130-01 FFXV 3RD.LOG 





[11:32] <darksydephil> hello, anybody here? 

[11:33] <darksydephil> so im gonna try and find out how to use a 3rd party service to see who subs etc 
[11:34] <darksydephil> done 

[11:34] <darksydephil> and streamlabs apparently is super simple to use 
[11:35] <darksydephil> nice! 

[11:35] <darksydephil> thanks datmeece that actually just helped me test it! 

[11:35] <darksydephil> it shows that you just gave those bits 
[11:35] <darksydephil> and it lists all new subs 

[11:35] <darksydephil> i can even see follows but thats not needed right now 

[11:35] <darksydephil> this is super easy, very nice 

[11:36] <darksydephil> this thing can be pretty elaborate 

[11:36] <darksydephil> you can set it up with OBS to show the pop ups for thank yous etc, but im not gonna do 
that 

[11:36] <darksydephil> it can also be used to set up donation drives 

[11:36] <darksydephil> like, for actual charity OR for raising funds to buy something on a stream 
[11:36] <darksydephil> pretty interesting 

[11:37] <darksydephil> so i got 4 new subs overnight even when i wasn't streaming lol 
[11:38] <darksydephil> i got 50 new followers since last night 

[11:39] <darksydephil> probably people whov'e just started watching me in the last 2 years 

[11:40] <darksydephil> i have not 

[11:40] <darksydephil> baby steps 

[11:40] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:40] <darksydephil> thats fine bethe2670 

[11:40] <darksydephil> oh wow, they improved chat here too, pressing tab autocompletes names, thats nw

[11:43] <darksydephil> sweet wassaup Darknightmaredzero 

[11:43] <darksydephil> looking like this is going to be far more social than my youtube streams, which is good 

[11:44] <darksydephil> ok im on the desktop, let me get this set up on the laptop now 

[11:44] <darksydephil> right now minimum bits to get your message stickied is 10 

[11:44] <darksydephil> and i think the minimum is 10 overall too 

[11:44] <darksydephil> yeah i changed it 

[11:44] <darksydephil> after you guys told me about it 

[11:46] <darksydephil> you guys want nightbot back? 

[11:46] <darksydephil> if you know how to use nightbot already ill get it 
[11:46] <darksydephil> i USED to know, but ive forgotten 

[11:47] <darksydephil> if its paid-for die, i dont care, i probably wont get the die or season pass 
[11:48] <darksydephil> ok did nightbot join? 

[11:48] <darksydephil> aha 

[11:49] <darksydephil> well enjoy, i know nightbot was very useful before 
[11:49] <darksydephil> untl it stopped working from time to time lol 
[11:49] <darksydephil> ok im going to start setting up the stream now! 

[11:49] <darksydephil> CarefreeCanuck thanks im actually using it, JUST set it up like 10 minutes ago! 

[11:53] <darksydephil> ok tim eto set up steamlabs on the laptop 

[11:53] <darksydephil> WTF why is my dashboard saying i ran a commercial lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> oh ok, whats the authorization command? 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ill do it right now 
[11:56] <darksydephil> oh. well it doesn't work 

[11:56] <darksydephil> it says i need a nightbot user ID, not a twitch one 

[11:56] <darksydephil> and i have no idea how you get that 

[11:56] <darksydephil> i thi nk YOU GUYS have to log into nightbot 



[11:56] <darksydephil> and it gives you a unique ID 

[11:57] <darksydephil> in th eupper righthand corner of the browser 

[11:57] <darksydephil> and i have to add those 

[11:57] <darksydephil> this is far more complicated than it used to be lol 
[11:59] <darksydephil> i dont think my PMS work 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i think they were disabled when i deactivated the account 
[11:59] <darksydephil> be theres non in there since 2014

[12:00] <darksydephil> ok everything seems in order, im going to start the stream now 
[12:00] <darksydephil> stream starts right now lol 
[12:07] <darksydephil> good to see you static 

[12:07] <darksydephil> one of the few holdouts from the old mod staff 

[12:08] <darksydephil> yeah today's stream starts with the story, its unavoidable, i cant do anything else lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> ok let me tweet that we’re live 

[12:16] <darksydephil> *** shitballs 

[12:16] <darksydephil> could you guys see that? 

[12:16] <darksydephil> or was it censored lol 
[12:16] <darksydephil> LOL 
[12:16] <darksydephil> shitballs 
[12:16] <darksydephil> but not *** 

[12:16] <darksydephil> twatty shitballs 
[12:16] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:16] <darksydephil> i dont know how the censor is enabled to begin with 
[12:16] <darksydephil> it must be on by default 
[12:16] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ok the filter should be off now 
[12:18] <darksydephil> fuck shitballs twat 
[12:18] <darksydephil> ok lol 
[12:19] <darksydephil> ok prestream time 

[12:43] <darksydephil> fyi im also testing to see if it still tells me when the ad is over 
[12:43] <darksydephil> its SUPPOSED TO but doesn’t walways work 
[12:44] <darksydephil> its running two ads?? i didnt tell it to do that 
[12:44] <darksydephil> wtf lol 
[12:44] <darksydephil> 4 ads! 

[12:44] <darksydephil> holy crap 

[12:44] <darksydephil> now i know why they promised increased adv revenue lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> well at least the ads work, but im worried about hte 4 ads back to back lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> are the ads done yet? 

[12:45] <darksydephil> its not telling me they are 
[12:45] <darksydephil> still going! LOL 
[12:45] <darksydephil> sweet jesus 

[12:45] <darksydephil> you cannot stop ads manually, once they run they run lol 
[12:46] <darksydephil> OK it says that the ads ended for me...did htey? 

[16:09] <darksydephil> damn these stats are good 

[16:09] <darksydephil> 15 new subs, 2384 bits during that stream 

[16:10] <darksydephil> if i can keep it up, streaming may actually be profitable, the bits add up 

[16:20] <darksydephil> the game crashed, wasted 30 minutes of my time, and the major boss fight was ruined by 

awful controls, should i just ignore ALL of it? should i be silent then? lol 

[16:20] <darksydephil> ill just be completely quiet whenever the game fucks up i guess 

[16:24] <darksydephil> the extra month delay did nothing, it was something behind the scenes that square enix 

didn't want to admit publicly 

[16:24] <darksydephil> it had nothing to do with polish at all, and it wasn’t the day 1 patch like they said, 



because there was a still ahuge day 1 patch lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161130-02 FFXV 4TH.LOG 

[18:48] <darksydephil> ok back 

[18:48] <darksydephil> gonna add the new vids to playlist and then get set up 

[18:50] <darksydephil> everyone's major criticism is the combat, seems most are liking the game otherwise 
[19:00] <darksydephil> got a few more subs when i was on break, nice 

[19:00] <darksydephil> well i dunno if i should say that since i dont know how to do it Popsicolo lol 

[19:05] <darksydephil> ok i just tweeted that we’re live 

[19:05] <darksydephil> so we should get some newcomers shortly 

[19:05] <darksydephil> then we'll begin 

[19:06] <darksydephil> mvc4, lol 

[19:06] <darksydephil> 3 was awful, so 4 will be even worse i guess 

[19:07] <darksydephil> i have no idea what fightcade is 

[19:07] <darksydephil> so that would be why 

[19:08] <darksydephil> nobody cares Dukesdearfreja 

[19:08] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:08] <darksydephil> seriously 

[19:08] <darksydephil> FAR too late to fix that game 

[19:08] <darksydephil> we’re in chapter 3 right now 

[19:08] <darksydephil> just beat the behemoth 

[19:08] <darksydephil> moving on, going to check out where thye're saying Titan is 

[19:08] <darksydephil> so may get the first summon tonight 

[19:09] <darksydephil> so yeah, ill talk about emotes in a sec 

[19:09] <darksydephil> be the news sucks, they changed the etnire emote system 

[19:09] <darksydephil> ok i guess ill talk a bit now, give me a sec 

[21:36] <darksydephil> i got rid of him 

[21:36] <darksydephil> i seriously have no idea wtf he's talking about and it's enough spam 

[21:37] <darksydephil> so if i get 8 more subs, we can have 6 emotes, and i can delete a few/add a few so they' 

better 

[21:37] <darksydephil> yeah maybe even tomorrow, we’ll see 
[21:44] <darksydephil> hey guys 

[21:45] <darksydephil> im deleting the old emotes except for surpriseddsp and angrydsp 
[21:45] <darksydephil> i dont even know how to get them to work lol 
[21:45] <darksydephil> how do you do the emotes? 

[21:45] <darksydephil> dspsurpriseddsp 

[21:45] <darksydephil> nope 

[21:46] <darksydephil> dspSurpriseddsp 

[21:46] <darksydephil> there we go, it needed the cap 

[21:46] <darksydephil> im adding a cowboy dsp right now, bu tthey have to approve it i believe 
[21:46] <darksydephil> everything is gone besides those 2 deep 
[21:46] <darksydephil> they sucked anyway 

[21:47] <darksydephil> now ill have an open spot for someone to make an emote 

[21:47] <darksydephil> and when i hit 50 subs, 2 more spots 

[21:47] <darksydephil> people are workign on and submitting them now here 

https://thekingofhate.eom/forums/topic/2960-dsps-twitch-return-chat-emotesfanart/#comment-74235 

[21:47] <darksydephil> sure if you'd like Marie. I can’t see them be i have the default white background 

[21:47] <darksydephil> yeah, hes just a troll 

[21:48] <darksydephil> pretty obvious 

[21:49] <darksydephil> the new emote will be dspeowboy 

[21:49] <darksydephil> its me in the cowboy hat with a surprised face, and its really clear 




-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161201-01 FFXV 5TH.LOG 

[11:44] <darksydephil> testing

[11:44] <darksydephil> ok good 

[11:45] <darksydephil> it wasn't at first, kept saying it was timign out 

[11:45] <darksydephil> dspcowboy 

[11:45] <darksydephil> nope not enabled yet 

[11:45] <darksydephil> i wonder what the timeframe is to get an emote working 

[11:45] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[11:45] <darksydephil> howd you do it? 

[11:45] <darksydephil> dspCowboy 
[11:45] <darksydephil> aha! 

[11:45] <darksydephil> nice so its pretty fast 

[11:46] <darksydephil> thats a great one, really clear 

[11:48] <darksydephil> well we definitely hit hte November patreon goal 

[11:48] <darksydephil> even with over $100 of declined pledges lol 

[11:51] <darksydephil> ok 

[11:51] <darksydephil> just messaged all of November's declined patrons 

[11:52] <darksydephil> gonna tweet and then get the stream running 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ok so i need you guys to help me out today 

[11:54] <darksydephil> yesterday Onyx mirrored this stream on thekingofhate.com 

[11:54] <darksydephil> i want to see if it works once im live 

[11:54] <darksydephil> can you check it out? 

[11:55] <darksydephil> wow according to Twitch stats, i may have made almost $200 already. 

[11:56] <darksydephil> oh wow, its not even updated yet for yesterday 
[11:56] <darksydephil> so i guess we’ll see 

[11:56] <darksydephil> the thing is, righ tnow a lot of people are subbing etc 

[11:57] <darksydephil> but that might not keep up 

[11:57] <darksydephil> we’ll have to see 

[11:57] <darksydephil> the bits helped TONS 

[11:57] <darksydephil> holy crap they really added up 

[11:57] <darksydephil> ad revenue was almost nothing! Although i only ran like 2 ads 
[11:57] <darksydephil> lets see once yesterday's data is fully updated what it says 
[11:57] <darksydephil> this data is very interesting to say the least 
[11:58] <darksydephil> OK let me set the stream up now lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i have amazon prime, so i guess that means i have a free sub too? 

[12:00] <darksydephil> im pretty sure i cant sub to myself lol 

[12:01] <darksydephil> where do you do that? i haven't seen the option anywhere 

[12:03] <darksydephil> test 

[12:03] <darksydephil> hmm the badge didn’t update 
[12:03] <darksydephil> wait 
[12:03] <darksydephil> there it is 

[12:03] <darksydephil> soulrider: those emotes are incredibly old, and used the old legacy naming system 
[12:04] <darksydephil> we’re talking almost 4 years old 

[12:04] <darksydephil> if i can fix them, i actually will, right now just getting into the swing of things 
[12:04] <darksydephil> so twitch prime allows you to get 1 free sub a month? 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ok thats cool 

[12:06] <darksydephil> well it looks like you cannot just edit an emote, you have to delete it completely and start 
over 

[12:06] <darksydephil> thats lame 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ill look into it more later 

[12:06] <darksydephil> right now i have to get the stream going lol 




[12:07] <darksydephil> ok im giong to tweet that we’re live 
[12:07] <darksydephil> oh wait 

[12:07] <darksydephil> can you guys check out thekingofhate.com and see if the stream is live there too? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> if you can see it on the website, how does it look? 

[12:09] <darksydephil> ill only stream if hteres demand 
[12:09] <darksydephil> we’ll see how this stream does today 

[12:09] <darksydephil> i actually want to play pokemon so that may be tomororw, and if so ill stream it 

[12:09] <darksydephil> bu tno idea how that will do views-wise etc 

[12:10] <darksydephil> boxman id say 400 is a good number to judge by 

[12:50] <darksydephil> can you hear me talking at all 

[12:50] <darksydephil> ? 

[12:54] <darksydephil> so i restarted OBS...it didnt fix anything 

[12:55] <darksydephil> i guess i can restart the PS4 and try again, i have no idea whats going on 
[12:55] <darksydephil> this has never happened before 

[12:56] <darksydephil> the game audio isn’t muted on OBS. it shows it as working 
[12:56] <darksydephil> there was no audio in the recorded video either, no game audio 
[12:56] <darksydephil> yet OBS is showing active game audio 
[12:57] <darksydephil> im going to restart the PS4 completely 
[12:57] <darksydephil> give mea sec 

[12:58] <darksydephil> this is one of hte wweirdest things ever honestly 

[12:58] <darksydephil> and no, nothing in OBS is muted, ill reiterate that lol. it shows as working perfectly 

[12:58] <darksydephil> yet the game audio isn’t being captured, ive changed no settings at all 

[12:58] <darksydephil> ok PS4 is booting 

[12:59] <darksydephil> ok reopening OBS 

[13:01] <darksydephil> still not working 

[13:01] <darksydephil> all i can do is restart the PC at this point 

[13:01] <darksydephil> its OBS or something with the PC, be the ps4 is fine 

[13:02] <darksydephil> LOL how many times do i have to say that nothing is muted before it’ll sink in... 

[13:02] <darksydephil> ok restarting the PC 
[13:04] <darksydephil> ok PC is booting up 
[13:06] <darksydephil> OK, PC is rebooted 
[13:06] <darksydephil> opening OBS again 
[13:09] <darksydephil> messing with it now 
[13:09] <darksydephil> give me a sec to try stuff 

[13:11] <darksydephil> ok heres the deal, its only capturing the audio now when i output it to the desktop, which 
makes ZERO sense whatsoever, its an OBS issue for sure 

[13:14] <darksydephil> ok im going to try just capturing the desktop audio, it seems OBS has shit the bed doing 

it the right way 

[13:18] <darksydephil> ok 

[13:18] <darksydephil> so i think i have a workaround 

[13:18] <darksydephil> but its not solving hte problem, just putting a bandaid on it 
[13:18] <darksydephil> i wish i knew what the actual problem was 

[13:19] <darksydephil> the problem is 100% in OBS, but nobody on the internet seems to have this problem or 
posted about it 

[13:20] <darksydephil> running a quick test now 
[13:20] <darksydephil> then stream will be back 
[13:20] <darksydephil> give me one more sec 
[13:22] <darksydephil> ok stream is returning now 
[13:22] <darksydephil> thanks for being patient, everyone! 

[13:23] <darksydephil> ok we good? 

[13:55] <darksydephil> stream working fine for everyone? 

[14:33] <darksydephil> wait mode IS ON lol 



[14:34] <darksydephil> im sorry but this battle system is pretty shitty 

[14:35] <darksydephil> its just chaotic and not very fun when your team's AI gets it killed in 10 seconds 
[14:47] <darksydephil> i love how people are being critical of how i've done up to this point when ive done tons 
of side content to the point the veiwers complained, and the game hasn't explained much of anything at all on 
what you're supposed to be doing 

[14:47] <darksydephil> how about you judge the game for what it is instead of after doing research on "how 
you're suppose dto be playing it" 

[14:50] <darksydephil> i dont dislike the game at all. i just wish i knew what hte fuck i should be doing, because 
there'se so little guidance on what's important or even how to be successful in combat or otherwise, how am i 
getting steamrolled if i'm 10 levels above enemies 
[14:51] <darksydephil> i did do some hunts 

[15:12] <darksydephil> the tutorial doesn't explain much but basics, it certainly doesn’te xplain why you get 
steamrolled in combat being 10 levls above enemies 

[15:14] <darksydephil> hey Supers 18 , youre such an idiot that you dont relaize you can’t mash to fight in this 
game lol 

[15:14] <darksydephil> but please keep spamming your bullshit, makes you look dumber and dumber 
[15:17] <darksydephil> saying "learn the combat" is incredibly silly, i did the tutorial and am playin the game, 
how do i magically learn how to play correctly? 

[15:17] <darksydephil> that's the games job 

[15:18] <darksydephil> im not at a camp, so how do i even cook? 

[15:18] <darksydephil> its never explained, all i know ho wto do is cook at camps and im not in the overworld 
now to do that 

[15:51] <darksydephil> i didnt even blacklist any words, jackass, my mods did 
[15:51] <darksydephil> you're hte insecure idiot who has to talk abou tit 
[16:10] <darksydephil> ooh someone uploaded a nice new emote for us! 

[16:10] <darksydephil> it's me in my "hmm" pose 
[16:10] <darksydephil> im gonna upload it now 

[16:12] <darksydephil> LOL I'd be OK with a fapping emote if someone made a good one 
[16:12] <darksydephil> i really dont care 

[16:12] <darksydephil> also i have 48 subs now. 2 more and we can add 2 more emotes fora total of 6 
[16:12] <darksydephil> IMO the streams have been a lot of fun 
[16:13] <darksydephil> more interaction, more feedback etc 
[16:14] <darksydephil> wow thanks richter! 

[16:14] <darksydephil> so thats 49 subs now! 

[16:17] <darksydephil> it was overnight last time 

[16:17] <darksydephil> the new emote will be my HMM pose so it’ll be dspHmm 

[16:18] <darksydephil> id like to change the icon, but i dont have any ideas really 

[16:19] <darksydephil> SOOO my day 1 FFXV vids did decently as I’d expect on YT 

[16:19] <darksydephil> day 2 vids did awful, not one has lk views except the vid where the game crashed 

[16:20] <darksydephil> dunno if that means people will watch later or they watched the first ones and said "fuck 

this boring game" 

[16:20] <darksydephil> in the long-term its not a big deal as ill have 2 new games next week 
[16:23] <darksydephil> i dont care about the game awards, ill be playing FFXV 
[16:23] <darksydephil> and i still have no idea WTF went wrong with OBS, by the way 
[16:23] <darksydephil> totally stumped 
[16:23] <darksydephil> i just hope it keeps working this way 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161202-01 FFXV 6TH.LOG 

[19:07] <darksydephil> dspHmm 

[19:12] <darksydephil> not ready yet lol 

[19:12] <darksydephil> hopefully tomorrow 

[19:12] <darksydephil> and ONE more sub to get 6 emotes 




[19:12] <darksydephil> i already have a fapping emote ready to upload lol 
[19:13] <darksydephil> not according to twitch lol 
[19:15] <darksydephil> oh okay lol 

[19:15] <darksydephil> well i meant here, one more sub and i get 2 more emotes enabled 
[19:15] <darksydephil> ok im off to play more FFXV for a couple of hours, later 
[21:52] <darksydephil> dspHmm 
[21:52] <darksydephil> darn not ready yet lol 

[21:53] <darksydephil> hey just heading out for the night, great FFXV session i had so be sure to check the vids 
on DSPGaming as they go live 

[11:05] <darksydephil> darn! They didn’t enable my new emotes yet 

[11:08] <darksydephil> I did hit the 50 subs needed to have six emotes though! So there’s still an open spot. 

[11:46] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:47] <darksydephil> did you all get caught up on the 2 hours i played FFXV offline last night? 

[11:47] <darksydephil> it was a pretty good session 

[11:48] <darksydephil> great, now we're finally OUT of the demo areas lol 

[11:48] <darksydephil> thanks for the emotes Tylerjku 

[11:49] <darksydephil> i have two new emotes submitted, they just weren’t approved yet 

[11:50] <darksydephil> and i have space for one more after that thanks to hitting 50 subs last night! 

[11:50] <darksydephil> no becuase i need to upload a final emote first 
[11:50] <darksydephil> then it should show the next goal i thi nk 
[11:51] <darksydephil> that makes sense 

[11:51] <darksydephil> i dunno if ill hit that, i dont think i ever did back in 2013-2014 honestly 

[11:52] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[11:53] <darksydephil> lets see if we can hit 400 again 

[11:53] <darksydephil> if so ill keep streaming this so we’ll see 

[11:53] <darksydephil> tomorrow is Pokemon Moon btw 

[11:54] <darksydephil> oooh bits 

[11:54] <darksydephil> thank you 

[11:55] <darksydephil> my first 2 days of streaming were pretty profitable 

[11:55] <darksydephil> but i guarantee it'll dip now. maybe pick up again with new releases next week 
[11:55] <darksydephil> stupid prompto! 

[11:56] <darksydephil> they seriously said "you're a frog now prompto" 

[11:56] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:56] <darksydephil> wow thanks devin! 

[11:57] <darksydephil> i think my december patreon goal is going to be a marathon chill stream on here 
[11:57] <darksydephil> like a series of games that don't go well as playthroughs but where i can just hang out 
with you all for a day 

[11:57] <darksydephil> im very curious to see how that would do 

[11:58] <darksydephil> Popsicolo your attempt was seriously better than the other guy who tried twice and 

wanted to charge, lol 

[11:58] <darksydephil> what a mook 

[11:59] <darksydephil> it didn't help the guy then admitted he had made art for the SOK and charged THEM for 
it 

[12:00] <darksydephil> Icureditwithmybrain i bet there are a bunch of popular games on twitch here for chill 
streams, no? 

[12:00] <darksydephil> wow thanks robwest22 ! 

[12:01] <darksydephil> i wonder if nightbot could auto-thank someone for subbing 

[12:01] <darksydephil> and the only other thing id say Marleve Lynen is maybe have nightbot ask peple to 
check teh rules on my channel page from time to time 

[12:01] <darksydephil> capcom cup? you mean featuring the fighting game OF THE YEAR!? 

[12:02] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> SFV is a piece of shit, and those game awards are nothing but hipster circle jerks and 



paid for advertising 

[12:02] <darksydephil> i.e. a complete waste of time 

[12:02] <darksydephil> then youtubers make pointless fluff raction videos to all that crap lol! 

[12:02] <darksydephil> the gravy train just keeps rolling for these people 
[12:03] <darksydephil> meanwhile, here i am, WORKING 
[12:03] <darksydephil> overwatch is not GOTY 

[12:03] <darksydephil> it's a great MP game but it lacks essential elements necessary to be called GOTY 
[12:03] <darksydephil> it won because BLIZZARD 
[12:04] <darksydephil> is the stream live? 

[12:04] <darksydephil> my player never updated 
[12:05] <darksydephil> ok let me tweet that we're live 
[12:06] <darksydephil> stupid dashboard won’t load right on my laptop 
[12:06] <darksydephil> fucking POS 

[12:07] <darksydephil> damn, there are a lot of gullible people who really think i was banned 

[12:07] <darksydephil> seriously, stop believing everything you hear from dumbfuck kids on the internet 

[12:12] <darksydephil> how do you enable dark mode? 

[12:12] <darksydephil> be it'd made htis WAY eaiser to read 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yup 

[12:13] <darksydephil> way better lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i knew it 

[12:13] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i hope we can get enough today to continue streaming this but i guess we’ll see 
[12:13] <darksydephil> Guardians of The Galaxy, starring Troy Baker as Starlord and Laura Bailey as Gammora! 
[12:17] <darksydephil> Troy Baker looks like a douche to every normal male, but to hipster women, he's a sex 
god 

[12:17] <darksydephil> that guy probably gets laid by so many dumb girls 
[16:11] <darksydephil> thanks folks for a great stream! 

[16:11] <darksydephil> tomorrow it's pokemon, we’ll see what happens, i may continue to stream this, we’ll see 

[16:11] <darksydephil> i do like the massive chat interactions that happen 

[16:12] <darksydephil> sadly they didn’t process my emotes yet

[11:44] <darksydephil> this is one of the thigns i disliked about twitch, they're inconsistent as all hell 

[11:44] <darksydephil> how did i get new emotes approved overnight one day, now its been almost 3 days and 

nothing 

[11:45] <darksydephil> wtf, pokemon moon isn't an available game to stream in the selections/??

[11:49] <darksydephil> thats not hte issue soulrider95 




[11:49] <darksydephil> if i even have the capture software open while obs studio is open, it crashes 
[11:49] <darksydephil> i dont even GET to the step of capturing it lol 

[11:50] <darksydephil> let's hope people show up for pokemon todya, no idea if it will or not 
[11:50] <darksydephil> if THEY will lol 

[11:51] <darksydephil> tomorrow is also up in the air, i may try the RE7 demo, but i dunno how it's gonna go

[12:05] <darksydephil> its like 56 to 44 percent

[12:07] <darksydephil> did the page just update to say im playing ffxv? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> what should i think? its a typical HD remaster 

[12:08] <darksydephil> and i just played the games, so not too interesting outside of playing crash 3 
[12:09] <darksydephil> either pokken tourney or king of fighters, both were much better games 
[12:11] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:11] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet out 

[12:12] <darksydephil> Pokemon did better than i’d expected honestly, think it topped around 350 which was 
better than youtube

[12:39] <darksydephil> hello 

[12:39] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:40] <darksydephil> just announced it on twitter 

[12:40] <darksydephil> got a lead on great quests today, apparently 2 big sidequests that are actually my level 
[12:40] <darksydephil> smells good so far! 

[12:43] <darksydephil> so a new emote is available for usbs 

[12:43] <darksydephil> subs 

[12:43] <darksydephil> dspHmm 

[12:44] <darksydephil> no, they just didnt approve it 

[12:44] <darksydephil> i haven’t received anything about it yet 

[12:45] <darksydephil> ok stream should be live shortly 




[12:45] <darksydephil> gonna get OBS going 

[12:53] <darksydephil> minrn the house smells freaking good lol 

[12:54] <darksydephil> LOL stream says theres 1 viewer 

[12:54] <darksydephil> so that means all of you are fake except for one person 

[12:54] <darksydephil> actually, im watching, so you're all fake! 

[12:54] <darksydephil> yes all subs can now enjoy dspHmm but sadly the O face has not been approved yet 
[12:55] <darksydephil> ill get it approved 

[12:55] <darksydephil> if they dont approve this, ill resumit it and call it something totally different like ROAR 
Or something 

[13:04] <darksydephil> here is the the new emote dspHmm 

[13:48] <darksydephil> im back, are commercials still showing or over? 

[13:49] <darksydephil> i dont remember how to get a stream taken down lol. i think its a special twitch email 
[14:14] <darksydephil> eah 
[14:14] <darksydephil> yeah 
[14:14] <darksydephil> fuck off 

[14:14] <darksydephil> nobody lied or stole anything and im tired of dumbfuck kids saying that with zero proof 
[14:14] <darksydephil> eat a dick 
[14:17] <darksydephil> next! 

[14:19] <darksydephil> you can’t pay back patrons, because there's no way to tell who specifically pledged for 
what, and i did something people asked for they wanted MORE than what i’d originally promised, nothing was 
"stolen" at all, just dumbfuck kids say that to cause drama 
[15:44] <darksydephil> i didn’t get lost...the fuck are you talking about lol 

[15:44] <darksydephil> i followe dthe dungeon, it loops into itself twice and doesn't ever let you get to tha tledge 
[15:45] <darksydephil> i did check the map. a ton of times, on stream, are you blind? lol 
[15:45] <darksydephil> seriously, some of the stuff people say in here is so idiotic 
[15:45] <darksydephil> open your eyes 

[16:17] <darksydephil> the sauce simmers slowly all day, for 4.5-5 hours 
[16:17] <darksydephil> it doens't burn, im not boiling it lol 
[16:42] <darksydephil> you cant save in dungeons 
[17:16] <darksydephil> anyway 

[17:16] <darksydephil> lets see how many subs i have total now 

[17:16] <darksydephil> i have 72 total subs! pretty awesome 

[17:17] <darksydephil> i bet we'll see more during this week's new releases 

[17:17] <darksydephil> today's stream was more profitable than the last 2 days lol 

[17:17] <darksydephil> and it was out of nowhere, thats cool, thanks for hanging with me all! 

[17:18] <darksydephil> pretty late, im playing til around 9:30pm PST and then uploading, so probably around

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 
[11:55] <darksydephil> need to grab losenges 
[11:56] <darksydephil> btw one new emote approved, one denied 
[11:57] <darksydephil> no, Twitch just has unfair double standards 

[11:57] <darksydephil> they ALWAYS have, it was one of the reasons i didnt want to come back 

[11:57] <darksydephil> "innapropriate content" and thats it 

[11:57] <darksydephil> im going to resubmit it as Roar 

[11:57] <darksydephil> be it kind of like that too 

[11:58] <darksydephil> im going to try dspRoar right now 

[11:59] <darksydephil> resubmit it and see if it'll go through quick 

[11:59] <darksydephil> in the meantime dspNothing 

[11:59] <darksydephil> so i literally did everything i could this morning 




[11:59] <darksydephil> gargled salt water, drank tea, took decongestant, now im drinking ginger ale 

[11:59] <darksydephil> and about to use losenges too. not much can bet done otherwise 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ok BRB, setting up the stream and submitting tha temote again 

[12:00] <darksydephil> yeah Paul was a great guy, im trying to hear what happened 

[12:02] <darksydephil> so I have 73 subs now! 27 to go to get another 2 emotes 

[12:14] <darksydephil> yeah i have to change the title, hold on 

[12:14] <darksydephil> LONESTAR! 

[12:15] <darksydephil> I HATE WHEN MY SCHWARTZ GETS TWISTED! 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ok i thi nk im all set up to go now 
[12:18] <darksydephil> let me tweet that we’re live 
[12:20] <darksydephil> ok i just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:20] <darksydephil> BTW i have the results from yesterday's stream, with ALL those ads I ran, guess how 
much $ i made on ad revenue? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> teemu9492 got it! $15 bucks, and i took like 8 ad breaks, thats crazy...BAD lol 

[12:21] <darksydephil> that means their ads are incredibly unprofitable 

[12:25] <darksydephil> yes, please type snort in the chat, you dumbfuck kids 

[12:26] <darksydephil> yeah mineraft would probably fit perfectly 

[12:26] <darksydephil> for some reason the sub badge looked better years ago lol 

[12:26] <darksydephil> i think they upped the quality of the badges and emotes now so it looks like shit in 
comparison 

[12:27] <darksydephil> i think it originally was just a crown, lol 

[12:27] <darksydephil> im definiteion down for a new sub badge if people wanted to take a stab at it 
[12:27] <darksydephil> nothing i could do looks good in dark mode, thats wha ti use 
[12:28] <darksydephil> i mean dspNothing 

[12:29] <darksydephil> well we're not getting the O face emote, they just declined it again 

[12:29] <darksydephil> again, massive double standards, which is why i fucking hate twitch 

[12:29] <darksydephil> completely unequal treatment of streamers 

[12:30] <darksydephil> inappropriate content 

[12:30] <darksydephil> thats it 

[12:30] <darksydephil> complete bullshit 

[12:31] <darksydephil> because it's completely double standard and unfair, that's why. if i had 10k subs they'd 

do it in a heartbeat 

[12:31] <darksydephil> ok 

[12:31] <darksydephil> prestream time 

[12:31] <darksydephil> here we go 

[14:37] <darksydephil> nice i’m up to 78 subs! Only 22 more to get 2 more emotes!

[19:00] <darksydephil> honey is just a sweetener, it doesn't actually help the sore throat lol 

[19:00] <darksydephil> and im OK with bitter tea 

[19:02] <darksydephil> nope, email is better 

[19:02] <darksydephil> i miss a lot of tweets everyday 

[19:03] <darksydephil> so 5 new subs and 1900 bits today so far, nice 

[19:03] <darksydephil> only problem is, it sa late stream, lots of people asleep already 

[19:04] <darksydephil> i literally haven’t spoken normally since the last stream, saved my voice the entire time 




[19:04] <darksydephil> so we’ll see how it goes 

[19:04] <darksydephil> no talking yet, stream just went live 

[19:04] <darksydephil> ill tweet about it in a sec 

[19:04] <darksydephil> kipplez i have a lot of international viewers 

[19:04] <darksydephil> in europe its very early morning righ tnow 

[19:05] <darksydephil> bigspens : no FF tomorrow, it'll return thursday at the earliest 

[19:06] <darksydephil> why on earth would you watch anohter transformers movie trailer lol 

[19:07] <darksydephil> lewddudex that emote is permanently out, they refuse to approve it 

[19:07] <darksydephil> so whatever 

[19:07] <darksydephil> nice, thanks Dilrow! 

[21:33] <darksydephil> twitch has never treated all streamers equally 
[21:33] <darksydephil> theres always blatant favortism 

[21:33] <darksydephil> why do you think i was forced to lower my stream quality in 2014 when others were 
stremaing at the same as i was? 

[21:34] <darksydephil> because he’s crazy, i dunno 
[21:34] <darksydephil> probably just wants the attention 

[21:34] <darksydephil> i bet if i raised it so that it's a whole dollar to do bits, he’d still do it. id make 100 dollars 
a day streaming because of him 

[21:34] <darksydephil> i guarantee its not his money, probably his daddy's 
[21:35] <darksydephil> ok folks im out! see you tomorrow for more dead rising 4 

[21:35] <darksydephil> i actually like the game so far, although it is a bit more cheesy and far less challenging 
[21:35] <darksydephil> it's still fun though

[12:07] <darksydephil> but now im congested and my throat is tickling me, but the mucinex is starting to work 
[12:08] <darksydephil> yes, they actually coordinated using cloned twitter acounts to false vote, they'd done it in 
the past so the accounts already existed 
[12:08] <darksydephil> some voted like 40 times lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> they even waited for me to go to sleep to do it. when i went to sleep TLG was over 10% 
behind both FFXV and Dead Rising 4. i wake up and it's in the lead? fuck now lol 
[12:09] <darksydephil> i do want to play TLG, but not because trolls say so 

[12:10] <darksydephil> i wanted to see what my actual viewers wanted and the poll was successful because i’m 
not a dumbass 

[12:10] <darksydephil> ok stream should be going live momentarily 
[12:11] <darksydephil> gee, wonder who he's a part of! lol

[19:03] <darksydephil> sorry but it isn’t RPG combat hwen you can't see wtf is going on and your entire team is 
getting wiped constantly

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161210-01 DEAD RISING 4 4TH.LOG 

[11:44] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:44] <darksydephil> im' back and feeling much better 






[11:45] <darksydephil> taking yesterday off was exactly the right thing to do lol 

[11:45] <darksydephil> ive gota bit of lingering congestion and cough but so much better than it was 

[11:46] <darksydephil> hopefully people got caught up on the new stuff from this week with the day off. i have 

no idea, i was pretty out of it 

[11:46] <darksydephil> it didnt help that i had to actually run errands regardless of being sick 

[11:47] <darksydephil> yeah, yesterday was the worst, throat still hurt plus i couldn't breathe nor talk 

[11:47] <darksydephil> now soreness is completely gone, im almost fully decongested 

[11:47] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna set up hte stream and get it going before i grab some drinks 

[11:54] <darksydephil> FFXV side content is good if you know where the good stuff is 

[11:54] <darksydephil> sadly thats always the issue with RPGs, they pair actually good dungeons and the like 

with repetitive garbage 

[11:54] <darksydephil> and with FFXV theres literally no indication where the dungeons are. so you have to 
look shit up or just stumble upon it 
[11:55] <darksydephil> LOL man 
[11:55] <darksydephil> these fucking kids these days 

[11:55] <darksydephil> someone on the forums wanted to know the full story or what happened with twitch 2 
years ago 

[11:55] <darksydephil> i took the time to type out this super detailed explanation yesterday, despite being sick 
[11:55] <darksydephil> kid responds today, "well, you made that all up, i dont believe you" 

[11:55] <darksydephil> fucking stupid brat 

[11:55] <darksydephil> because he was trolling to begin with, obviously 

[11:56] <darksydephil> a lot of posters on the forums are like that, they bait me into explaining situations just to 
basically say im a liar lol 

[11:56] <darksydephil> i dunno why i fucking bother 
[11:56] <darksydephil> when i feel like it 

[11:56] <darksydephil> right now im so behind i want to play the games im enjoying far more 

[11:58] <darksydephil> hope everyone built up their bits for today, lol. after losing out on a day yesterday i hope 

i can come back strong with these longer streams 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ok just activated the stream, let's see if this goes smoothly or not lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> im gonna do a TEST recording first so we dont lose the entire prestream like the other 

day 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i keep seeing the stream twitch but not go live 
[12:00] <darksydephil> sigh 

[12:01] <darksydephil> i thinkt hey fucked up again

[12:03] <darksydephil> so timely for this time of year 
[12:08] <darksydephil> ok im going to tweet that we're live

[19:17] <darksydephil> so anyway 

[19:17] <darksydephil> ill start talking ina sec, let me twee that we’r elive 

[20:13] <darksydephil> rx93gundamm : just becuase you’re a sub doesn’t give you free reignt to say incredibly 

dumb or insulting shit in the stream chat 

[20:13] <darksydephil> keep it up and say good bye 

[20:13] <darksydephil> this is your only warning 

[20:13] <darksydephil> see? 

[20:13] <darksydephil> just like that fucking moron 

[20:13] <darksydephil> no, just work drama with Leanna, they're trying to screw her over and make her work 

even later than shes scheduled which they can’t do, but of course they will anywa 

[20:14] <darksydephil> and shes alreayd feeling shitty trying to get over the cold so shes super upset 

[20:14] <darksydephil> now they're telling her that she only gets a 30 minute break when she's actually owed an 

hour break, basically the manager is an asshole 

[21:28] <darksydephil> they didnt even animate sea mist lol 

[21:28] <darksydephil> pretty lame honestly 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161211-01 FFXV 12TH.LOG 

[12:03] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[12:03] <darksydephil> stream going live momentarily 

[12:03] <darksydephil> and ill actually test the recording BEFORE prestream today lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ah it's live already 

[12:05] <darksydephil> that's a good sign 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ok let me dummy record 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ugh this stupid cold 

[12:06] <darksydephil> today my throat is tickling me like crazy 

[12:06] <darksydephil> you're gonna hear me clearing it all stream 

[12:08] <darksydephil> damn 

[12:08] <darksydephil> yesterday's stream results are disappointing 





[12:08] <darksydephil> i streamed two longer streams and only made $20... 

[12:09] <darksydephil> far less than usual, i guess a lot of people didn’t come by be id been sick or something 
[12:09] <darksydephil> i did notice far less bits 
[12:09] <darksydephil> thanks amocoru! 

[12:09] <darksydephil> it really is the bits that make it profitable daily, the subs definitely help but it's the 
constant bits that add up bigtime 

[12:10] <darksydephil> and most people get bits for free by watching ads 

[12:10] <darksydephil> pretty crazy, a TOTALLY different business model than it used to be 

[12:10] <darksydephil> ads are like, the worst way to make money here lol 

[12:10] <darksydephil> ok recording is working 

[12:10] <darksydephil> time to tweet out that we’re live 

[12:17] <darksydephil> oooh i got two new subs overnight! 

[12:17] <darksydephil> lets see how many i have total now 
[12:18] <darksydephil> 94 subscribers! 

[12:18] <darksydephil> nice! 

[12:18] <darksydephil> getting there up to 100 
[12:18] <darksydephil> pwnage_101 i already tested twice 
[12:18] <darksydephil> so if it messed up again, i acn’t help it 
[12:19] <darksydephil> when i hit 100 i can have 8 emotes 

[12:19] <darksydephil> but honestly right now i can have a new one, but nobody has submitted any lol 
[12:19] <darksydephil> the fap emote will never happen so 
[12:19] <darksydephil> any other new ones would be appreciated 
[12:19] <darksydephil> yeah i saw LinkinSimpson 

[12:20] <darksydephil> so i guess im definitely playing overwatch on main stream tuesday, sweet 
[12:20] <darksydephil> i probably wont stream batman, but we'll see if there's enough demand 
[12:21] <darksydephil> its like ive said, im OK streamin ga lot if its profitable and so far it has been, yesterday 
being kind of an exception since i streamed far more and made less than usual...so we'll see moving forward 
[12:21] <darksydephil> zzman2000 : OPEN fan appreciation can't even happen anymore, the trolls have 
completely ruined it for everyone, thats why im doing the closed patron events now 

[12:22] <darksydephil> wrath_7 , what exactly do you suggest i do to stop them? theres no regulation on it and 
no safeguards in place 

[12:23] <darksydephil> last time i did open fan appreciation, trolls took up mor ethan half the spots and everyone 
was hugely disappointed 

[12:23] <darksydephil> its not worth it for me to organize the entire thing just to see it fail because of the actions 
of fuckwads 

[12:24] <darksydephil> thanks superrambo! 

[12:24] <darksydephil> is he not even in the chat? lol 
[12:25] <darksydephil> OkNOPE you show as subbed lol 
[12:25] <darksydephil> sounds like a bug 
[12:25] <darksydephil> ok prestream time 

[17:23] <darksydephil> so the plot of FFXV actually makes sense, it just sucks lol 

[17:23] <darksydephil> that's better than FFXIII did though 

[17:38] <darksydephil> i might finish the story later tongiht 

[17:38] <darksydephil> we'll see 

[17:38] <darksydephil> ill announce on twitter if i do 

[17:38] <darksydephil> why do you have another name??

[12:10] <darksydephil> and yeah, its not good, ive dropped like $300 on patreon in the last week 
[12:12] <darksydephil> eobardthawn362 well it's uncertain, keep in mind, twitch keeps HALF of all sub revenue 
[12:12] <darksydephil> so if theoretically those patrons came over here and subbed instead, im actually making 
half as much 

[12:13] <darksydephil> but im sure a lot of it is bits too, which is 100% profit for me...so ther;s really no way to 
tell 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i wont know until this month ends really 

[12:13] <darksydephil> then i can see how profitable it was being here all month 

[12:13] <darksydephil> BTW someone reminded me of the Christmas WWE sims last night, i was like WTF i 
almost forgot! 

[12:13] <darksydephil> ill probably do those Christmas eve or day 
[12:14] <darksydephil> ok turning on the stream now 

[12:15] <darksydephil> twitch takes a 50% cut on subs, patreon takes a 10% cut. its WAY less 

[12:17] <darksydephil> ok time for the test recording before i do prestream lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> guess what? OBS crashed 

[12:18] <darksydephil> gotta restart 

[12:18] <darksydephil> glad i tested this POS 

[12:19] <darksydephil> yeah ocarina should be good, so will whichever FF i choose to play 
[12:20] <darksydephil> no settings are "wrong" eobardthawn362 

[12:20] <darksydephil> or else it would crash constantly, it doesn’t, it just randomly doesn’t record at the start of 
a stream 

[12:20] <darksydephil> then i restart and it works 
[12:20] <darksydephil> it's the program, its very shoddy 
[12:20] <darksydephil> ok imtesting recording again 
[12:22] <darksydephil> my website works fo rme 
[12:22] <darksydephil> OK recording worked, thank god 
[12:29] <darksydephil> let me pop a cough drop now lol 

[12:30] <darksydephil> you mean trico doesn’t just fucking stand there like a dumbfuck when you're pointing 
RIGHT AT WHERE YOU WANT HIM TO GO!?! 

[12:30] <darksydephil> lol 



[16:12] <darksydephil> 3 hours left? lol 
[16:12] <darksydephil> jesus nobody can agree 

[16:14] <darksydephil> so it sounds like i WILL need another major stream then 

[16:14] <darksydephil> that could be Thursday. Guess we’ll see 

[16:16] <darksydephil> i just tweeted onyx about it 

[16:16] <darksydephil> be i needed the fanart for tonight’s stream lol 

[16:18] <darksydephil> ok, so around 2-3 hours left, ill probably finish it on thursday day 

[16:18] <darksydephil> then 

[16:19] <darksydephil> since tomorrow its overwatch and Wednesday is ffxv 

[16:20] <darksydephil> it's sad that the game is so damn boring, after 10 years its the same exact game they were 
making, so now its massively outdated 
[16:20] <darksydephil> what a shame 

[16:21] <darksydephil> you can tell a game is boring when we have almost 400 watching and nobody was even 
giving bits lol 

[16:22] <darksydephil> people were asleep 
[16:22] <darksydephil> yeah thats exactly right 

[16:22] <darksydephil> fans of ICO/SOTC will love it, everyone else will hate it. its not for 2016 audiences at all 
[16:22] <darksydephil> i cant wait to rip into the mainstream media who gave the game 8s and 9s. fucking 
hipster douchebags 

[16:23] <darksydephil> im seriously tired of every "artsy" game now getting high scores when actual gamers 

dont like the fucking games 

[16:23] <darksydephil> underestimating?! 

[16:24] <darksydephil> no, the mainstream media ARE the "deep" gamers, and they sell shoddy games like this 
becuase their reviews aren’t actually in line with reality and what the common gamer thinks 
[16:24] <darksydephil> they're a bunch of hipster morons, like i said 

[16:25] <darksydephil> yeah im gonna check out metacritic before i do my own review and see what others have 
said, can’t wait to tear into some of these idiots 

[16:26] <darksydephil> the major issue isn't even the framerate. it's the game, it's outdated, boring, slow pacing, 
no actual suspense (until JUST NOW with this other Trico) and no story, its just crap and not worth 60 bucks 
[16:26] <darksydephil> this premise looked amazing to us 10 years ago. now we've seen better games 
[16:28] <darksydephil> how is this game emotional? at least so far, there has been zero emotional ties at all. i 
guss maybe something happens at the end lol. we'll see later this week 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161212-02 DEAD RISING 4 5TH.LOG 

[18:51] <darksydephil> ok im back 

[18:51] <darksydephil> setting up for dead rising 4! 

[19:02] <darksydephil> ok stream should be going live now 
[19:03] <darksydephil> any day now.... 

[19:03] <darksydephil> no, obs is working, but the stream isn’t going live on the twitch side yet 
[19:03] <darksydephil> ah mine is loading now too 
[19:03] <darksydephil> there it is 

[19:04] <darksydephil> no music, let me boot the game for some holiday jams 
[19:06] <darksydephil> shoudl be playing now 
[19:06] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:07] <darksydephil> oh great, the glitch happened again 
[19:07] <darksydephil> i have to restart OBS 
[19:07] <darksydephil> good thing i tested 
[19:07] <darksydephil> this program sucks ass 

[19:08] <darksydephil> in a triple threat there's only supposed to be one pinfall or submission 
[19:08] <darksydephil> there shouldn’t be any countouts or DQs 
[19:08] <darksydephil> testing right now 
[19:08] <darksydephil> ok it worked this time 




[19:09] <darksydephil> so then they're going more by the rules of a tag match 
[19:09] <darksydephil> ok i mgonna tweet that the stream is live now that its working 

[19:11] <darksydephil> i wish we could get WWE network in the living room but neither our TV nor our blu ray 
player support the damn app. only my ps3/ps4 do 

[19:12] <darksydephil> and it’d be too much of a hassle to find a way to hook one of those up along with all the 
other shit we alreayd have in the entertainment center lol 
[19:12] <darksydephil> yeah both are Samsung 

[19:12] <darksydephil> and they have common stuff like netflix, amazong etc but not wwe network yet that i can 
see 

[19:12] <darksydephil> i guess i can try and check, its been like 6 months since i last did 
[19:13] <darksydephil> my schedule is public andreiil984 

[19:13] <darksydephil> theres no need to ask what im going to play when its posted on my twitter and in the 
week in preview 

[19:14] <darksydephil> yeesh. if i dont get some more bits/subs tonight, today will be the worst profitable day 

streaming since i returned to twitch. TLG really killed it lol 

[19:14] <darksydephil> FFXV story will be done, but not post game i dont thi nk 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i heard the puzzle dungeon alone is 5 hours long 

[19:15] <darksydephil> i already knew how FFXV would end because i saw kingsglaive lol 

[19:15] <darksydephil> its a huge fucking spoiler 

[19:17] <darksydephil> ok ill start talking in a sec 

[19:17] <darksydephil> just trying to finish this cough drop 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161213-01 OVERWATCH 18TH.LOG 

[11:44] <darksydephil> whoa 

[11:44] <darksydephil> twitch updated the dashboard overnight 
[11:44] <darksydephil> it actually added a couple of new things 
[11:44] <darksydephil> you can actually see how many subs you have now lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> also they removed the ability to run ads when you're not streaming, which i always 
wondered about 

[11:45] <darksydephil> we’re talking about the broadcaster dashboard, if you don't broadcast, you don't see it, so 
you wouldn’t notice 

[11:46] <darksydephil> btw new emote is live! 

[11:46] <darksydephil> dspWowdude 

[11:47] <darksydephil> tons of people are probably going to be streaming overwatch today lol 
[11:47] <darksydephil> im definitely getting some lootboxes, Christmas skins ftw 
[11:48] <darksydephil> bethe it is up in the uSA 
[11:48] <darksydephil> but you're not USA, right? 

[11:48] <darksydephil> DeltaForce355 i’m not spending any mor emoney on SFV 
[11:48] <darksydephil> so unless he's completely free, nope 

[11:48] <darksydephil> that game can die. only fgc hardcore even talk about or play it anymore 
[11:48] <darksydephil> i expect mostly mccrees 

[11:49] <darksydephil> especially since the game was like 20 bucks for a week during black friday 

[11:49] <darksydephil> mvc infinite ill play, it actually is looking more like old school vs games such as Xmen 

vs SF, which was my favorite 

[11:49] <darksydephil> so we’ll see. it'll probably still be horribly broken bullshit though 

[11:50] <darksydephil> brb, gonna get drinks adn then start the stream 

[11:50] <darksydephil> the patch is almost done installing 

[11:50] <darksydephil> i hope it doesn’t Popsicolo , that sucked last time 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ugh 

[11:54] <darksydephil> the new layout looks awful on my laptop... 

[11:54] <darksydephil> everything is squished 

[11:54] <darksydephil> dont think they actually messed enough with it lol 




[11:54] <darksydephil> the chat is squashed all the way to the right side of the screen now 

[11:55] <darksydephil> i think ill pop it out 

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok 

[11:55] <darksydephil> lets see how this works 

[11:56] <darksydephil> they'd said symmetra would be improved 

[11:58] <darksydephil> good to see the top story in my APple news feed today is that Kanye West visited Trump 
Tower, because nothing else is going on in the fucking world 
[11:58] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:58] <darksydephil> ok, going to get the stream live now lol 
[12:04] <darksydephil> oh crap i misclicked 
[12:04] <darksydephil> sorry all, ad is playing by acccident 
[12:04] <darksydephil> my fault lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> actually i only see the option to run a 30 second ad now 

[12:05] <darksydephil> thats not good, for longer breaks i like to run the block of ads. they removed it... 

[12:05] <darksydephil> sigh 

[12:07] <darksydephil> but if you’re going on a real break Bammbino , then being limited to ONE 30 second ad 
is ridiculous 

[12:07] <darksydephil> its been 3 minutes and the ability to run an ad hasn’t even returned yet lol, it's greyed out 

[12:08] <darksydephil> testing recording now 

[12:08] <darksydephil> hopefully it fucking works today 

[12:08] <darksydephil> 'if not a quick restard 

[12:08] <darksydephil> restart 

[12:08] <darksydephil> thanks N0 H3R0 ! 

[12:08] <darksydephil> oh good, the same bug just happened 
[12:08] <darksydephil> let me try something 
[12:09] <darksydephil> darn didnt work 

[12:09] <darksydephil> well i have to restart the stream again, seems like a regular occurrence now that OBS 
studio is a piec eof shit lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> stream will quickly restart, brb 
[12:10] <darksydephil> ok testing recording again 

[12:11] <darksydephil> oh yeah? not surprising, if its happening to me its got to be with others too 

[12:11] <darksydephil> ok recording worked again, im seeing the pattern now lol 

[12:11] <darksydephil> first attempt at recording always fails, have to restart obs then it works 

[12:13] <darksydephil> ok i just tweeted that we’r elive 

[12:13] <darksydephil> ill talk in a sec, gonna blow my nose first lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> dspWowdude 

[12:21] <darksydephil> looks like the "new" twitch dashboard is messed up, viewer count isn't updating for me 
unless i freaking refresh the page.... lame 

[12:22] <darksydephil> LOL now twitch says im not online despite my watching my own stream on the 
dashboard 

[12:22] <darksydephil> this new dashboard is pretty buggy lol 
[13:43] <darksydephil> how does the stream look for everyone? 

[13:43] <darksydephil> i just relaized its the first time i streamed this on twitch 
[13:43] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[13:43] <darksydephil> now im just nervous about how the vidoes will look 
[13:43] <darksydephil> guess we’ll see lol 
[14:20] <darksydephil> ok later pharoah 
[14:50] <darksydephil> is the stream working? 

[14:50] <darksydephil> its buffering nonstop on my screen wtf 
[14:50] <darksydephil> ok let me refresh 


#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161213-02 BATMAN EP5.LOG 




[17:35] <darksydephil> stream title updated 

[17:35] <darksydephil> therefore you know what's coming now! 

[18:50] <darksydephil> anybody around? 

[18:50] <darksydephil> cool 

[18:51] <darksydephil> setting up the batman stream now 

[18:51] <darksydephil> ive actually heard its the shortest episode, wtf lol 

[18:55] <darksydephil> so heres the deal 

[18:55] <darksydephil> today playing Overwatch, sadly the videos on YT kind of look shitty 
[18:55] <darksydephil> they're very jumpy and jarring because the framerate is all over the place 
[18:55] <darksydephil> yeah, but im glad i did that today because it was a good test, its not like anybody is going 
to be super angry that th evids don't look so hot 

[18:56] <darksydephil> SO what i think im going to do, moving forward... 

[18:56] <darksydephil> if a game runs at 60fps, i may stream it on YOuTube. that way i can stream/record at the 
same quality and the youtube videos will NOT be affected 

[18:56] <darksydephil> everything else will be on Twitch, and let's face it, the vast majority of games these days 
dont do 60fps 

[18:56] <darksydephil> no, i DID record at 1080/60fps 
[18:56] <darksydephil> BUT 

[18:57] <darksydephil> the issue is, i cannot stream at that quality because of twitch's bandwidth limitations 
[18:57] <darksydephil> and streaming at one quality while recording in another is VERY taxing on my 
computer's CPU 

[18:57] <darksydephil> it works for 30fps games, but not for 60, as we can now see in today's videos 
[18:58] <darksydephil> exactly! 

[18:58] <darksydephil> soooo i guess the decision moving forward will be: if a game is 60fps, do i record/stream 
it at 720p/60fps only, OR do i go back to YouTube to stream it at the full 1080p/60fps.... 

[18:58] <darksydephil> its a tough call 

[18:58] <darksydephil> for example, resident evil 7 

[18:59] <darksydephil> its going to be the first major game where i have to make this decision 
[18:59] <darksydephil> TONS of people will want to see me play it on twitch 

[18:59] <darksydephil> but that would mean lowering the quality of the YT videos to 720p...so i dunno 
[18:59] <darksydephil> for RE7, honestly? i dont think it would matter that much, the game isn’t the best looking 
game at all 

[19:00] <darksydephil> but for all new releases moving forward, it could be a tough call. 

[19:00] <darksydephil> they can. they just don't care 

[19:00] <darksydephil> Twitch business methodology is: make as much money as possible with as little as 
possible 

[19:00] <darksydephil> that's it 

[19:00] <darksydephil> they don't care about the quality of the streams at all 

[19:01] <darksydephil> that's why they changed their entire business methodology from "the best game 
streaming service on the net" to "a place where you can share in the personalities of streamers" lol! 

[19:01] <darksydephil> because they found out that people will open their pockets for people with charisma and 
doing constant shoutouts etc 

[19:02] <darksydephil> yeah, it's a shame BC youtube streaming, overall, is better quality 

[19:02] <darksydephil> but YouTube management are so dumb fuck stupid and douchey, they can't accept that 

they squandered the live streaming opportunity 

[19:02] <darksydephil> youtube gaming! We’ll just make a website and app and hope everyone uses it, despite 
not having any competitive advantage and a far worse chat! sounds like a great idea lol 
[19:03] <darksydephil> oh shit, its after 7. let me get the stream going, my bad lol 

[19:05] <darksydephil> Marie: Twitch says you can only stream content EXCLUSIVE to their platform for 24 
hours 

[19:05] <darksydephil> deep beat me to it lol 

[19:05] <darksydephil> so for example, if i only play RE7 on youtube, then i can play anything else here on 



twitch, but i couldn’t simulcast on both services, or have the on demand videos on both sites at the same time 

[19:06] <darksydephil> thats why amocoru 

[19:06] <darksydephil> they saw it as direct competition 

[19:06] <darksydephil> shit, stream not live yet is it? 

[19:06] <darksydephil> its not going live fo rme but i turned it on 
[19:06] <darksydephil> oh it' slive?!? 

[19:07] <darksydephil> my dashboard isn’t working here 
[19:07] <darksydephil> ok let me refresh 

[19:07] <darksydephil> ok it is working, the dashboard just wasn't working 
[19:07] <darksydephil> this new dashboard has a lot of bugs to work out lol 
[19:08] <darksydephil> ok im going to use the restroom, then ill finish setting up etc 
[19:08] <darksydephil> bandwagoningman : i used xsplit from 2013-2014 

[19:08] <darksydephil> but it didn’t work properly with my capture device when i upgraded after i got the new 
pc etc 

[19:08] <darksydephil> and i dont know if they ever fixed that issue or not. be it woudln't work AT ALL with it 
[19:09] <darksydephil> i probably still have the xsplit subscription be i bought like 3 years during thi shuge 
discount 

[19:09] <darksydephil> ok shit, i have to piss, brb lol 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ok back 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we’re live 

[19:13] <darksydephil> crowd play was too distracting with the CONSTANT up and downvoting 
[19:13] <darksydephil> no idea why they even put it in there be it didn’t amount to anything anyway 
[19:14] <darksydephil> just tweeted that we’re live 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i believe total cost of my internet for both lines combined is just under $400 a month lol 
[19:14] <darksydephil> fucking Comcast 

[19:15] <darksydephil> yup its the only way to avoid the bandwidth caps they've now enforced 

[19:16] <darksydephil> yup and it's them or nothing, no other providers do internet fast enough for streaming 

here, same as in CT where i was always stuck with Cablevision 

[19:17] <darksydephil> keep in mind, my internet is 2 business lines, fastest available here, unlimited data, no 
caps etc and 24/7 customer support 

[19:17] <darksydephil> so its really expensive for a reason 

[19:17] <darksydephil> i NEVER would have gotten my DDoS issue last year resolved if i just had regular 

residential internet, they woudln't have given a shit lol 

[19:18] <darksydephil> because no internet is 100% stable, Skulljackl7 

[19:18] <darksydephil> and FIOS doesn't exist, it was a limited run test that isn't being spread any more 
[19:18] <darksydephil> what im wiating for is the fiber optic internet to spread out of downtown/campus Seattle 
into the surrounding territories, ill be on that shit 
[19:19] <darksydephil> yup 

[19:34] <darksydephil> do not make a listing of blacklisted words 

[19:34] <darksydephil> that will only lead the trolls to find ways around them 

[19:34] <darksydephil> thanks 

[21:13] <darksydephil> yeah i forgot the shoutouts 

[21:13] <darksydephil> ill do them tomorrow i guess 

[21:13] <darksydephil> rx93gundamm , you subbed, so if you don’t like my humor, you must be an idiot lol 
[21:14] <darksydephil> well you constantly talk shit in here, so i’d be surprised 
[21:14] <darksydephil> um, this guy paid to sub to me but just shits on me constantly in the chat 
[21:14] <darksydephil> that's idiotic 

[21:15] <darksydephil> i think he thinks that subbing gives him the right to insult me, but ive already warned 

him once, this is the 2nd time, im not going to be lenient forever 

[21:16] <darksydephil> ok you're all getting confused lol 

[21:16] <darksydephil> enough of this, i need to startuploading 

[21:16] <darksydephil> peace out all! See you for FFXV tomorrow

[19:08] <darksydephil> so theres a hunt for the boss of costlemark? 

[19:08] <darksydephil> right now im thinking of doing more of these legendary hunts since the last one was very 
doable, would have beaten it easily without using Shiva if she hadnt shown up 
[19:08] <darksydephil> and then eventually on to costlemark 

[19:10] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill definitely get that quest before i do costlemark yet 
[19:10] <darksydephil> what woman gives me a key to what? 

[19:11] <darksydephil> a lot of people were sayin ga LOT of stuf earlier and it was very confusing 
[19:11] <darksydephil> it would help if the game would just explain stuff, but nope, of course not 





[19:11] <darksydephil> yes, the locked doors 

[19:11] <darksydephil> so i have to complete costlemark before i can do that? 

[19:12] <darksydephil> be thats literally the only dungeon left 
[19:12] <darksydephil> i could do costlemark though, im level 60 now 
[19:12] <darksydephil> but i might want to do more legendary hunts first 

[19:14] <darksydephil> that woudln’t be a problem as long as they actually put a fucking camp in there unlike the 
sewer dungeon, but this game is incredibly inconsistent 

[19:14] <darksydephil> put camps into the EASIER dungeons and not the harder ones, wtf 

[19:14] <darksydephil> again, it feels so unfinished, like they meant to have a camp in every dungeon and just 

didnt get aroudn to it 

[19:15] <darksydephil> ive got stabbing pain in my throat, delightful, not a sore throat but a part is swollen up 
and hurts like hell 

[19:15] <darksydephil> think im goin gto use that throat spray shit to numb it before we start, just had a hot tea 

and it didnt do anything 

[19:16] <darksydephil> wtf are pitioss ruins 

[19:16] <darksydephil> shotinthedeep how have you NOT heard about how bad health care is and how it makes 

zero sense fo rme to ever see a doctor unless i'm not dying? lol 

[19:16] <darksydephil> oh, i know about the puzzle dungeon 

[19:16] <darksydephil> im doing it, but not now 

[20:41] <darksydephil> this dungeon is fucking boring 

[20:42] <darksydephil> way worse than the others, even the sewers were better 

[20:55] <darksydephil> congrats, you guys were like 40 seconds late lol 

[21:08] <darksydephil> you guys actually said RIGHT when i started this part 

[21:08] <darksydephil> so i chose right 

[21:08] <darksydephil> and now you say it was left lol 

[21:52] <darksydephil> im honestly not too angry, if all i have to do is refight that boss 
[21:52] <darksydephil> be that boss was fing easy lol 

[21:52] <darksydephil> if i had to redo ALL THE FUCKING FLOORS of the dungeon including the red giant 

fights, id lose my shit 

[21:53] <darksydephil> oh really? 

[21:53] <darksydephil> well id already won 
[21:53] <darksydephil> no reason to summon 

[21:54] <darksydephil> yeah seriously, why the fuck would you put that boss after a gauntlet of red giants... thats 
INSANELY STUPID 

[21:54] <darksydephil> like, game designer 101, PROGRESSIVE difficulty 
[21:54] <darksydephil> they didn’t even get that right 

[21:55] <darksydephil> sucks man, ive got such fucking blue balls, wanted to finish that dungeon tonight 

[21:55] <darksydephil> now i have to wait 2-3 days 

[21:56] <darksydephil> ok fair enough 

[21:56] <darksydephil> probably friday or Saturday then 

[21:56] <darksydephil> and then onto bigger fights 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161215-01 LAST GUARDIAN 3RD.LOG 

[11:54] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[11:54] <darksydephil> Icureditwithmybrain seriously? damn its a classic, happy to hear that you've now seen it! 

[11:55] <darksydephil> a Miyazaki anime woul dhae worked perfectly 

[11:56] <darksydephil> there's at least 2 hours left from what everyone saw on youtube 

[11:57] <darksydephil> people who've beaten this game take about 2 hours from the point i’m at, on average, to 
beat it 

[11:57] <darksydephil> so we’ll at least get most of a stream 

[11:57] <darksydephil> plus honestly, my voice sucks, so if we end early, good 

[11:58] <darksydephil> i dunno if tonight im doing dead rising 4 or working on TLG review, i think it depends o 




my voice, a stream may be LESS taxing as doing the voiceovers for a review is a ton of work 

[11:58] <darksydephil> i’m definitely going to download Lost Odyssey but im not going to play it in January 

[11:58] <darksydephil> thats far too much Crash for one year eobardthawn362 lol 

[11:59] <darksydephil> cless i said it would be on my bucket list and would be a great final game to play, yeah, 
but now i just want to play it after hearing the classic FF tunes from FFXV 
[11:59] <darksydephil> just got that itch and january is the perfect time to do it 
[11:59] <darksydephil> along with ocarina of time 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i also want to replay Dark Souls 1 as a legit playthrough, but i dont think ill be able to fit 
it in before RE7. because the year-end series always run long, but we’ll see what happens 
[12:01] <darksydephil> yeah, and i haven't even started on year end stuff yet. ive been crazy busy with these 4 
ongoing games 

[12:01] <darksydephil> so i need to start finishing these up 

[12:02] <darksydephil> i think dead rising will be 2 more sessions, FFXV postgame isn’t going to end anytime 
soon lol 

[12:03] <darksydephil> pokemon im only like 60% through i think 

[12:03] <darksydephil> and hilariously, according to youtube, dspgaming is doing awful this month, one of the 
worst ever apparently lol 

[12:04] <darksydephil> im hoping that the year end series give me a boost of views by the end of the month but 
who knows, may be a f ing stinker overall, so hopefully the twitch revenue will help that 
[12:04] <darksydephil> in comparison, last year i made a ridiculous amount f money in December, this is what 
all YouTUbers are talking about, YouTube massively changed something and now nobody is making money 
anymore 

[12:06] <darksydephil> i seriously need to start convincing people that youtube isn’t going to support me 
anymore, so they NEED to pledge to patreon and/or sub/give bits here, be at this rate, it's a joke 
[12:06] <darksydephil> im on pace to make HALF as much in december this year as i did last year...playing 
FOUR new games. 

[12:07] <darksydephil> i just dont think people take it seriously, is all 

[12:07] <darksydephil> they think im lying or something and that ill be here forever no matter what 
[12:07] <darksydephil> they believe these crazy conspiracies 

[12:08] <darksydephil> well yeah, Megamanntl25 . people won’t pledge or do anything, but then once i’m gone 

there will be a mass yell about how it's a shame i'm gone 

[12:08] <darksydephil> its the ultimate complacency 

[12:08] <darksydephil> especially when everything i do IS technically free 

[12:09] <darksydephil> ok, stream should be live? 

[12:09] <darksydephil> OK cool, and the recording issue is solved already 
[12:09] <darksydephil> it has nothign to do with the detractors and haters 

[12:10] <darksydephil> it has everything to do with the fact that im not making money anymore, just got 
notification my bank account is overdrawn, luckily my machinima payment is literally coming through today 
[12:10] <darksydephil> people think im lying or joking when i say that im in trouble, im not. those "dry" months 
in the summer through September really hurt me. and hteres stuff going n behind the scenes i dont talk about 
[12:11] <darksydephil> then on top of all that ive been sick, it just compiles more and more 
[12:11] <darksydephil> thats why i need to play FF4. i need to play something from my roots that i love and will 
get me feeling good about all this even if things aren't going well financially 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i watched It's a Wonderful Life last nigth and realized that's pretty much my situation 

[12:12] <darksydephil> that you guys have repeatedly helped me and pulled me out of hte fire just like George 

Bailey, but that things get to me a lot, just like they do to George, but then i get a wave of positivity and support 

and keep going be you tell me what i do here is meaningful 

[12:15] <darksydephil> ok swapping over to the laptop, give me a sec lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> im not down, i barely have a voice 

[12:20] <darksydephil> just like yesterday 

[12:20] <darksydephil> lol badge upgrade randomness 

[12:20] <darksydephil> lemon and honey dont do anything, lol. they just flavor hot tea 



[12:21] <darksydephil> what people seem to fail to realize about my pc is that i haven’t built a pc in ten years 
and wouldn’t recognize modern components, the last time i paid someone to build a pc for me, it horribly 
backfired and i got nothing but shit for it. so i bought a premade one, only to get shit for it lol 
[12:22] <darksydephil> there is no ideal situation here, i dont have the know how to build a pc, EVER again, so 
ill always overpay and get something not as good as if it were custom built by a pro 

[12:22] <darksydephil> when i bought this PC, everyone assured me it was powerful enough to both record and 
stream at the same time, as soon as i got it, everyone said it wasn’t lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> i have no "friend" to build a pc for me. there is no "shop" that magically does this service 

[12:23] <darksydephil> this is not a fantasy world lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> this is what people dont seem to understand 

[12:23] <darksydephil> ok im going to say this again 

[12:23] <darksydephil> I AM NOT GOING TO BUILD A PC 

[12:23] <darksydephil> holy fuck people dont get this 

[12:24] <darksydephil> "have a friend build it for you" which i did, years ago, and got an underpowered, 
damanged PC that peopel did nothing but make fun of lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> again, its easy to live in a fantasy world, thats not my reality 

[12:25] <darksydephil> i dont have any money, i cant buy a ps4 pro, im not buying a new computer any time 
soon 

[12:26] <darksydephil> the next necessary equipment ill need is probably a new TV and ps4 pro 

[12:26] <darksydephil> RickGrimesFanl23 don't you remember all of 2015 when i was selling them? lol 

[12:27] <darksydephil> yeah and/or assholes saying they wer einterested but then just wasting my time 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so i stopped for an entire year, might bring it back next year, we'll see 

[12:28] <darksydephil> there is no saving 

[12:28] <darksydephil> i have no money to save 

[12:28] <darksydephil> all money goes direct to bills 

[12:29] <darksydephil> dumb fuck kids 

[12:29] <darksydephil> ok prestream time i guess 

[13:32] <darksydephil> when did i "almost ragequit" exactly? lol 

[13:33] <darksydephil> rush?!?! 

[13:33] <darksydephil> lolol 

[14:19] <darksydephil> a technical giant? i can name 5 recent games that look better than this lol 
[14:20] <darksydephil> this would have been a technical giant 5-10 years ago, not today 
[14:43] <darksydephil> enough of that idiot 
[14:43] <darksydephil> this one too 

[14:43] <darksydephil> i wonder if these morons enjoy talking out of their asses and circle jerking each other 
when im trying to play a game 

[14:44] <darksydephil> insulting my reviews lol. yes, because every review i make, i totally make shit up about 
bugs 

[14:44] <darksydephil> get the fuck out of here 

[14:45] <darksydephil> most people who comments on my reviews say they're pretty damn good, even peopel 
who usually dont like me agree that my reviews are very fair, balanced and well thought out 
[14:45] <darksydephil> so when idiots are going to come in here and say that i make shit up and say theres tons 
of bugs in my reviews, they’re getting the fuck out 

[14:47] <darksydephil> ive cut down massively on rambling lately, if you haven’t watched the last few reviews 
[14:47] <darksydephil> trying to make them more streamlined without losing my critical points 
[14:47] <darksydephil> lol a $100 bit emote? thats insane 

[14:48] <darksydephil> skulljack: theres criticism and then theres just outright lies, its OK to say "you ramble a 
bit too much" but its not okay to say "you constantly call out bugs because you suck at games, they dont exist." 
One is an opinion, while the other is factually wrong 
[14:48] <darksydephil> see? 

[14:48] <darksydephil> johnnysabian says something thats an outright lie 
[14:48] <darksydephil> he gets fucking banned 



[14:48] <darksydephil> its cause and effect lol 

[14:49] <darksydephil> free speech allows you to just spew out incorrect things as facts? really? lol 
[14:50] <darksydephil> um, the entire stream chat was distracted from the game and talking about it here 
[14:50] <darksydephil> so i put an end to it lol 
[14:50] <darksydephil> again, cause and effect 
[14:50] <darksydephil> yeah, exactly 

[14:50] <darksydephil> you can say whatever you want, and then get your ass kicked afterward for it lol 
[14:51] <darksydephil> its like, you have the right to walk into a black neighborhood and say the N word out 
loud constantly, and you also have the right to get your fucking ass kicked immediately for doing it lol 
[14:53] <darksydephil> skulljack, you cannot make statements like that without evidence, lol. i run into TONS 
OF BUGS all the time that others dont. its kind of a running thing 

[15:11] <darksydephil> no alexdaye , i did not. i said i remembered how to use the shield, but not how to 
equip/unequip it which was never needed, two very different things 

[15:28] <darksydephil> if you think any kind of rules or order is naziesque, i suggest you move to a country with 
no organized government, and never attend any streams, ever. 

[15:49] <darksydephil> fucking moron 

[15:54] <darksydephil> yes Teslawasrobbedacl , its my fault the game does whatever it wants and kills me in a 
part i can’t do anything to hold on. you, sir, are a moron. 

[15:56] <darksydephil> another moron lol 

[16:07] <darksydephil> neonbornspartan9 yup, i fully agree, if hte game worked as intended it would have been 

2 hours shorter lol 

[16:26] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[16:26] <darksydephil> OBS had an error and completely restarted! lol 
[16:26] <darksydephil> it gave mea crash error so i closed it and started uploading 
[16:26] <darksydephil> and now it was opened again streaming wtf?! 

[16:26] <darksydephil> there is some weird shit giong on haha 

[16:26] <darksydephil> uh no, this time, all you caught me doing was uploading 

[16:26] <darksydephil> WITH MY PANTS ON 

[16:27] <darksydephil> dspSurpriseddsp is the camera on? 

[16:27] <darksydephil> completely naked, covered in baby oil....just uploading videos! 

[16:28] <darksydephil> nobody watched Monday's batch of TLG so i guess this batch will also go unwatched on 
YT lol 

[16:28] <darksydephil> sigh 

[16:28] <darksydephil> at least its almost over 

[16:30] <darksydephil> jesus that was a hell of a gauntlet you ran lol 

[16:30] <darksydephil> i couldn't play this game in one sitting, id lose it 

[16:30] <darksydephil> yeah ive played around 10 hours right now 

[16:31] <darksydephil> ok folks, see you at 7pm pst for the conclusion! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161215-02 LAST GUARDIAN 4TH.LOG 

[18:59] <darksydephil> hello all 

[18:59] <darksydephil> FYI setting up the stream now 

[18:59] <darksydephil> just gotta add the earlier vids to playlist first 

[19:05] <darksydephil> ok just turned the stream on 

[19:05] <darksydephil> so should be live shortly 

[19:06] <darksydephil> it only has one more area, according to those who've beaten it already, so i should be 
good 

[19:09] <darksydephil> i am not your daddy, and i dont want to be lol 
[19:09] <darksydephil> thanks Silentgeneral ! 

[19:10] <darksydephil> we see ya Skulljack 17 

[19:10] <darksydephil> yes, im that guy that speaks truth about the games he plays instead of blindly kissing ass 
to the big game devs when they fuck up 




[19:11] <darksydephil> ok let me tweet that the stream is live 

[19:12] <darksydephil> Silentgeneral did you cheer earlier today with bits? 

[19:12] <darksydephil> be if you did, i think that Streamlabs can’t read your name or something, it always shows 

up as an invisible name lol 

[19:13] <darksydephil> yea how bizarre 

[19:14] <darksydephil> every time you give bits its just a blank name 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i wonder if its a bug that has certain parameters in a name or something 
[19:14] <darksydephil> nope 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i have no desire to play anything else kingdom hearts until 3 is out 
[19:14] <darksydephil> persona 5 is a definite yes 

[19:15] <darksydephil> Karlis K i certainly did today, except for these glitches that dont list the name 
[19:15] <darksydephil> lets face it, im going to be insanely confused when i play KH3 regardless 
[19:15] <darksydephil> i dont need to suffer through another game lol 
[19:18] <darksydephil> Bammbino i have 2 plans for Christmas 

[19:18] <darksydephil> first on Christmas eve im doing a WWE2kl7 holiday fantasy sims session 
[19:18] <darksydephil> i do it every year, its always nuts, and peopel love it. the live stream should be super fun 
[19:19] <darksydephil> then on Christmas im going to do 1 stream, and its going to be a more "chill" stream 
where im talking with people outside of the gameplay. undecided what games its going to be but maybe 
battlefield, we’ll see 

[19:19] <darksydephil> Rpgmaniac23 i dont HATE it, but i dont feel like it's a necessary game, a person could 
skip this game completely and miss nothing, there have been similar and far better games int he last 10 years that 
have surpassed what this one was going for 
[19:20] <darksydephil> no, i will not 

[19:20] <darksydephil> well exactly, if you wer ea huge fan of team ico, and you've been eagerly awaiting this 
game for 10 years, you'll probably forgive its tons of shortcomings and love it. everyone else? lol 
[19:21] <darksydephil> pokemon will resume once these games start to complete, seeing that TLG ends tongiht, 
pokemon will return next week for sure 

[19:22] <darksydephil> well in order to review FFXV i want to do more postgame stuff, since it seems for those 
who love the gameplay, postgame is a HEAVY chu nk of hte game, it'd be completely unfair to review it before i 
did more of the endgame 

[19:22] <darksydephil> but im going to say sometime this comign week 
[19:23] <darksydephil> wtf was that 
[19:23] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:23] <darksydephil> he seriously typed a huge essay nobody could see? lol 

[19:24] <darksydephil> chapter 13 is not the worst thing in a game, by far. its functional, it just has no place in a 
FF game and that's why it sucks so bad 
[19:24] <darksydephil> time for a cough drop 

[19:25] <darksydephil> right now im on mucinex, robitussin and cough drops lol 
[19:25] <darksydephil> and my throat is still hoarse 

[19:25] <darksydephil> kamranml200 i imagine you don’t live in the USA? if you did, you'd know the answer to 
that lol 

[19:26] <darksydephil> ok then kamranml200 , makes sense lol 

[19:26] <darksydephil> here we don’t just get to go to the doctor, it means hundreds of not thousands of dollars 
in out of pocket costs 

[19:26] <darksydephil> so....we suffer, a lot. 

[21:00] <darksydephil> that's not an excuse for not explaining TO THE PERSON WHO PAID FULL RETAIL 
PRICE wtf is going on lol 

[21:00] <darksydephil> sure, maybe the boy doesn’t know, so explain it to us afterwards 
[21:01] <darksydephil> not "oh well, tough shit" 

[21:01] <darksydephil> and if there's a fucking paid-for DLC to explain, fuck this game even more lol 
[21:01] <darksydephil> yes, and those are weak fucking stories 

[21:02] <darksydephil> it shouldn’t be for anyone who wants to pay full retail price for a game, give me an 



incomplete story with outdated/shoddy gameplay and badly performing graphics, then don’t charge me full price 
[21:02] <darksydephil> for example, INSIDE earlier this year. I had a lot of issue with the plot, but the game 
wasn't $60. so it didn’t really have a huge affect on the overall game 

[21:03] <darksydephil> plot is an integral part of a satisfactory gaming experience in most cases, especially if the 
gaemplay isn’t riveting or addictive, so it HAS to be fully flushed out or else it's just cop out bullshit by the devs 
[21:03] <darksydephil> again, if this were 7 years ago, that gameplay and graphics WOULD have been 
groundbreaking, today, they are not 

[21:05] <darksydephil> that will always be the case, especially when you have a dedicated fanbase for a 
particular game dev 

[21:06] <darksydephil> look at final fantasy xv for example, that game has HUGE amounts of common 
problems that most people admit, but the fans are still saying it's insanely good while others are insanely 
disappointed 

[21:06] <darksydephil> luckily i tend to see these things from both sides of the fence and bring both perspectives 
into my reviews 

[21:08] <darksydephil> one perspective would be of the common gamer, comparing this game to all other 
modern games of recent memory 

[21:08] <darksydephil> the other perspective is from the viewpoint of someone who is a huge fan of 1. team ico 
or 2. more artistic style games 

[21:08] <darksydephil> I actually thing TLG has an audience, its just not a huge one in comparison with 
everything els eout there right now 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161216-01 FFXV 15TH.LOG 

[11:53] <darksydephil> test 

[11:53] <darksydephil> can anyone see this? 

[11:54] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[11:54] <darksydephil> testing 

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok good 

[11:55] <darksydephil> it wasn't working at first 

[11:55] <darksydephil> in fact emotes still aren’t working, my laptop never loads properly 
[11:55] <darksydephil> dspGlitch 
[11:56] <darksydephil> lol 
[11:56] <darksydephil> nice, thanks! 

[11:56] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[11:56] <darksydephil> thraot is STILL fucking swollen and in pain, sigh 
[11:56] <darksydephil> ok give me a sec to get the stream going 
[11:59] <darksydephil> you mean the jabberwock? LOL 

[11:59] <darksydephil> im also going to go to altissia to get that 3x exp hotel for sure, i want to get like 10 levels 
out of this dungeon be it was such a pain in the ass 

[12:00] <darksydephil> oh, i have to fight the boss and some normal mobs again, but i dont have to fight the 
fucking red giants thank god 

[12:00] <darksydephil> actually dont mind fighting the boss, it was easy and tons of exp 

[12:01] <darksydephil> holy fuck 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok gonna do that then lol 

[12:04] <darksydephil> im going to rest at the 30k inn after this dungeon is over 
[12:04] <darksydephil> for sure 
[12:08] <darksydephil> stream live yet? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i turned it on but not showing on my dashboard 
[12:08] <darksydephil> oh there it is 
[12:09] <darksydephil> i refreshed and it went live 
[12:09] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:09] <darksydephil> so my goal is to redo costlemark and find that gem for the quest, which i completely 
forgot about, since i dont have to redo the red giants it shouldn’t be tough at all. then i want to get max exp from 




it, so im going to altissia for the 30k 3x exp hotel 

[12:09] <darksydephil> after that, ill see waht level i am. hoping to be high enough to take on tougher hunts 
[12:10] <darksydephil> and some of the NEW dungeons that'll unlock once i have the final royal arm 
[12:10] <darksydephil> so...a lot still to do, which is good 

[12:10] <darksydephil> yeah im getting it just for the eventual zelda and the new mario, pretty much 
[12:12] <darksydephil> ok im going to tweet that we're live 

[12:16] <darksydephil> there are people who bought a wii u just for rayman legends. Nintendo doesn't give two 
shits lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> theres no way im going to do all of the grinding unlockable dungeons but ill give a few 
of htem a try 

[12:17] <darksydephil> ill definitely keep trying the hunts, and the puzzle dungeon etc 
[12:18] <darksydephil> i bet Gilgamesh is who cut Gladio's face. $20 

[12:18] <darksydephil> and you can't save in the dungeon, right? so you HAVE to do it in one shot or leave the 
ps4 on suspend? lol 

[12:19] <darksydephil> its official that nintendo canceled zelda on the wii u? or just rumor? 

[12:19] <darksydephil> ok i was gonna say, i didnt hear that yet 

[12:20] <darksydephil> well thats true LemonPlaysGames 

[12:20] <darksydephil> because they’re really not rumors, they're leaks 

[12:21] <darksydephil> isnt Chinatown wars like the old school top down GTAs? 

[15:10] <darksydephil> gino, stop spamming links 
[15:10] <darksydephil> thanks 

[15:17] <darksydephil> i was holding summon the entire time FYI 
[15:17] <darksydephil> i just didnt say anything

[12:28] <darksydephil> im a mess today lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> dead rising 4 is already $40 everywhere lol 
[12:35] <darksydephil> MOrBison no, on your balls 
[12:35] <darksydephil> gotta go all in or no thing 

[12:37] <darksydephil> so i got two subs yesterday when i didnt even stream, nice 

[12:38] <darksydephil> thanks bethe2670 for subbing 

[12:41] <darksydephil> no, we’re not getting another pet. why do you ask? 

[12:43] <darksydephil> lol we were just visiting a pet store and buying some xmas presents for Raisin, not in the 
market for a new pet 

[12:43] <darksydephil> those 3 mice were pretty cute though 

[12:45] <darksydephil> well doesn't look like anyboyd is really joining the stream, oh well, guess we'll start 
[12:46] <darksydephil> i wish i could turn it off for prestream 
[12:46] <darksydephil> well i guess i can, hold on lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161219-01 FFXV 16TH.LOG 

[11:48] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:48] <darksydephil> setting up now. feeling a bit better today than i have recently 
[11:50] <darksydephil> yeah they worked alright, cleared out my colon completely 

[11:53] <darksydephil> they're claiming they made it more competitive, which is hilarious becuase they spent 






the greater part of 2016 saying there was nothing wrong with the game, but now they're changing it lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> fuck that game, i used to be heavily into the FGC but now i dont let myself get fooled 

anymore 

[11:54] <darksydephil> im not going to waste more time and money on a poorly developed game 
[11:54] <darksydephil> oh wow, just read that news blue_blur64 congrats! 

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok stream going live momentarily 
[11:57] <darksydephil> thanks N0 H3R0 ! 

[11:57] <darksydephil> HOPEFULLY we’ll get back on track today 
[12:01] <darksydephil> ok so the stream is working? looks/sounds good? 

[12:02] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:02] <darksydephil> Popsicolo , is that how it works now? 

[12:02] <darksydephil> i didnt even know you could do that lol 
[12:02] <darksydephil> ok im looking it up 

[12:03] <darksydephil> theres a base badge for all, then a 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year 

[12:03] <darksydephil> thats pretty cool 

[12:03] <darksydephil> id say give it a go Popsicolo 

[12:04] <darksydephil> as for ideas, theonly thing i can think of is a crown 

[12:04] <darksydephil> no idea otherwise 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ok i just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:07] <darksydephil> so if the nintendo switch rumors are true, it'll be just about 60% as powerful as the ps4 
and xbox one, lol. what a surprise 

[12:08] <darksydephil> it may also run far worse when not docked be they want it to have a long battery life, so 
games will run like shit unless you're at home lol 
[12:08] <darksydephil> what a great idea 

[12:09] <darksydephil> they could not make a shitty portable systme, i guess? 

[12:09] <darksydephil> i mean, just saying, if this info is true, it's once again a kid's toy 
[12:09] <darksydephil> that's why i didnt get hyped at all for it with tha tfirst trailer. 

[12:17] <darksydephil> i cant believe people would be SO gullible as to give capcom even more money for a 
season 2 lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> its the previous model i believe theycallmejimbob 

[12:17] <darksydephil> if you play the living fuck out of the game you can get new characters for free 
[12:17] <darksydephil> everyone else has to pay 

[12:18] <darksydephil> Akuma should have been in the game at launch, why the flaming fuck would anybody 
pay for him now? so damned gullible lol 

[12:19] <darksydephil> far less than any numbered SF before kawinskey 

[12:19] <darksydephil> the difference is, now its "hype" because of live streaming coverage so you think that it's 
good when it isn’t 

[12:19] <darksydephil> hilarious that sales wise, SFV has done terribly, not even close to 1. their sales goals and 
2. SFIV sales 

[12:20] <darksydephil> yet "its the most watched SF in history!" 

[12:20] <darksydephil> yes, because people are stupid. 

[12:20] <darksydephil> you can no longer say that because people WATCH something, it's good, just look at 
PewDiePie. you've now proven against that fact 

[12:21] <darksydephil> in fact i’d say it's quite the opposite these days, the biggest audiences are the dumbest 
peopel flocking to whats popular because it's popular, not because it's good 
[12:21] <darksydephil> hearthstone lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> that game is such ass. it's completely RNG 

[12:22] <darksydephil> there isn't any skill involved besides building the best deck, then its all luck 

[12:24] <darksydephil> ok prestream time 

[15:05] <darksydephil> hey aceshigh 

[15:05] <darksydephil> you stupid gullible dumb fuck 

[15:05] <darksydephil> say goodnight 



[15:12] <darksydephil> its dumb because its a waste of fucking time, artifical wall to let you do stuff you're far 
above level to do 

[15:12] <darksydephil> awful outdated game design 

[15:51] <darksydephil> Christmas isn't in 4 days for anyone on planet earth lol 

[15:52] <darksydephil> the czech republich isn't 2 days ahead of anywhere, thats not how time zones work lol 
[15:59] <darksydephil> it doesn’t matter when you celebrate it, Christmas is actually on dec 25th and always has 
been 

[15:59] <darksydephil> lol

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[11:50] <darksydephil> setting up now, actually just downloading ep2 since it's a separate download that wasn't 
even up last night when i got ep 1 

[11:58] <darksydephil> ok episode finished downloading, so ill get the stream up and running now 

[12:01] <darksydephil> getting the stream going righ tnow 

[12:01] <darksydephil> remember i have to restart it be of hte damn obs issues 

[12:02] <darksydephil> OBS Studio still has the recording error every day when i boot it up and start streaming, 

and it still crashes every day when i close it. it's a very wonky POS lol 

[12:03] <darksydephil> uuugh wtf 

[12:03] <darksydephil> now its giving me errors.... 

[12:03] <darksydephil> sigh 

[12:04] <darksydephil> according to my computer it was running 3 times lol 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ive said 20 times over the last day im not playing any more SFV 
[12:04] <darksydephil> dunno what else i need to do to hammer it into peopels heads 
[12:04] <darksydephil> twitter, prestreams and the like 

[12:04] <darksydephil> the game is a piece of shit and will always be a piece of shit and im done wasting time 
on it 

[12:05] <darksydephil> season 2 will only suck more money out of peopels pockets that capcom doesn't deserve 
[12:05] <darksydephil> and that's their entire goal, but poeple are too fing gullible 
[12:05] <darksydephil> stop playing shit games, ignore the hype from idiots, thanks. 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ok stream should be live now 

[12:07] <darksydephil> so we’re going to re-build my previous TWD playthroughs in the game here 
[12:07] <darksydephil> a viewer actually went back and drew up a listing of ALL of my previous choices in 
TWD 1 and 2 for me to import here today, pretty awesome 
[12:08] <darksydephil> so we’ll do that live before we start 
[12:08] <darksydephil> that was you RickGrimesFanl23 ? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> thanks very much! 

[12:08] <darksydephil> gonna be awesome

[12:14] <darksydephil> lolol 

[12:19] <darksydephil> dark maggot is still around, i see him liking stuff on twitter from time to time, but 
considering i couldn’t use artwork for over a year, not surprised he hasn’t made his way back to doing fanart 
[12:19] <darksydephil> LOL people really like the dspGlitch emote eh? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> good to see everyone here and excited today, makes me feel energized for the stream!

[11:33] <darksydephil> email: darksydephil@hotmail.com 

[11:38] <darksydephil> depends, thats my personal email so i cant guarantee a response 
[11:38] <darksydephil> if theres a forum issue, theres not much i can do. im not the webmaster 
[11:38] <darksydephil> why, what is the issue? 

[11:39] <darksydephil> hey 

[11:40] <darksydephil> gotta use the restroom, brb then ill get the stream set up 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ok back

[11:54] <darksydephil> thanks SD Arch Angel 

[11:54] <darksydephil> ok setting up now, should be live soon 

[11:54] <darksydephil> oh, they've added a twitter feed right on the twitch page now lol 
[11:54] <darksydephil> thats....kind of unnecessary but okay 
[11:56] <darksydephil> yeah it installed yesterday, no idea what it does though 
[11:57] <darksydephil> theres a carnival? 

[11:58] <darksydephil> so im starting to see what the deal is with OBS being so wonky 

[11:58] <darksydephil> it doesn’t close, ever, it crashes, so windows always thinks theres multiple instances open 
lol 

[11:59] <darksydephil> im beginning to wonder if thats where all the trouble started weeks ago with teh audio 
issues 

[11:59] <darksydephil> at any rate, its working now 
[11:59] <darksydephil> so stream should be live if it isnt yet 
[12:00] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:00] <darksydephil> let me refresh my dashboard here 

[12:02] <darksydephil> after loading 4 times, finally got the page loaded lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> yeah yesterday was great viewership wise 

[12:02] <darksydephil> except nobody subbed and very few cheers, so it ended up being a dud streaming day lol 
[12:03] <darksydephil> i think with new releases and such it’ll get bigger 
[12:03] <darksydephil> right now its year end and very slow 

[12:04] <darksydephil> id actually like to replay Dark Souls I. but probably not gonna happen soon as i have 
ALL of the year end series to work on 

[12:04] <darksydephil> i dont even remember the last stream much, the gameplay yes, stream chat not really 

[12:05] <darksydephil> im talking about the last FFXV stream bethe2670 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:07] <darksydephil> there, back to the dashboard then lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> oh really? i was focused on the game 

[12:08] <darksydephil> didnt see any of that 

[12:08] <darksydephil> sadly thats twitch chat for you. a lot of damned nonsense 
[12:09] <darksydephil> great AlexanderRossi 

[12:09] <darksydephil> liked it far more than any of the recent telltale games 
[12:09] <darksydephil> finally back to their roots 
[12:09] <darksydephil> working on the DR4 review tomorrow night 
[12:10] <darksydephil> ive got so much to do right now

[12:14] <darksydephil> RE7 will be the priority in late J anuary for sure 

[12:15] <darksydephil> well the good thing is, it appears you can drop in/out of the VR in RE7 
[12:15] <darksydephil> which is GREAT, you don’t have to commit to a full playthrough with it 
[12:15] <darksydephil> so we’ll see what happens i guess lol 

[12:16] <darksydephil> im up to 116 subscribers! pretty sweet that it keeps growing 
[12:17] <darksydephil> yeah, who knows 

[12:17] <darksydephil> id hope that people are going to sub after the holiday etc. a lot of people told me they 

were going to sub when their next twitch prime thing came around 

[12:18] <darksydephil> sweet thanks lemon 

[12:19] <darksydephil> im starting prestream right now 

[12:19] <darksydephil> this very moment lol

[11:54] <darksydephil> setting up for the stream but nobody seems to have any idea about this holiday die so... 
[11:59] <darksydephil> oh im reading an article 

[11:59] <darksydephil> the holiday pack is only if you bought hte season pass lol 
[11:59] <darksydephil> no idea why people thought it was for everybody but its not 
[12:00] <darksydephil> sooo...fuck that then i guess 
[12:00] <darksydephil> i dunno where the carnival is 
[12:01] <darksydephil> lol yeah 

[12:02] <darksydephil> i just found the free pack and it says the carnival is in January lol 
[12:02] <darksydephil> people were pretty misinformed about this 
[12:03] <darksydephil> ok got the free holiday pack 

[12:05] <darksydephil> always nice to get a ticket for something that doesn’t exist yet 





[12:05] <darksydephil> whats teh point lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> well last night i got hte awesome item from the puzzle dungeon 

[12:06] <darksydephil> SO im going to try a few fights, do a couple more post-game dungeons to try and max 

my levels, then take on the lvl 99 hunts and adamantoise 

[12:06] <darksydephil> once thats doe, thats it, game over, ive done everything 

[12:07] <darksydephil> no idea, someitmes stuff is quick, sometimes not so quick, we'll see 

[12:11] <darksydephil> finally just found a workaround for my OBS crashing issues, now i wont have to restart

[11:48] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:48] <darksydephil> still downloading stuff in wwe here but almost done 
[11:49] <darksydephil> ok skull 

[11:49] <darksydephil> i have about 60 emails in my inbox i havent read yet including bills and important stuff 
so...yeah 

[11:53] <darksydephil> wow im going to have a different arena for EACH match tomorrow 
[11:53] <darksydephil> pretty sweet, theres more created stuff on wwe now than ever 
[11:57] <darksydephil> ok just reached my download quota for today lol 
[11:57] <darksydephil> its time to set up the stream 
[11:59] <darksydephil> lol well twitch is messed up 

[11:59] <darksydephil> it wont load my revenue tab or much of anything else 
[11:59] <darksydephil> good thing i have my dashboards open already 
[12:03] <darksydephil> are you kidding? 

[12:03] <darksydephil> DR4 is an obviously rushed game with a terrible story and not much to do besides chop 
the shit out of stuff, its mindless fun but its still mindless and completely forgettable 

[12:04] <darksydephil> the last guardian at least had some nice execution attempts and was somewhat unique for 

the time, overall you'll remember it far better as a gaming experience 

[12:04] <darksydephil> both games are insanely overpriced but DR4 is a huge ripoff IMO 

[12:04] <darksydephil> just because i liked a game for being chill fun doesn't mean its a good game lol 

[12:04] <darksydephil> thats like saying Stardew Valley is the best game ever made be its easy and chill 

[12:05] <darksydephil> thats not how you objectively review a game 

[12:05] <darksydephil> and thats whats missing from most mainstream reviewers, they dont get the difference 
[12:05] <darksydephil> Just updated the title of the stream 

[12:06] <darksydephil> SaintAnti you can't objectively review a game based on only on enjoyment, its 
impossible as differen people have different tastes, but you can objectively rate games on facts 
[12:06] <darksydephil> enough of that 

[12:07] <darksydephil> everyone who bothers me with SFV talk gets a timeout today 
[12:07] <darksydephil> at this point, it's intentional trolling 

[12:07] <darksydephil> so everyone can hear the 3ds and see the stream looks good? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> SaintAnti did you actually watch the reviews or just hear the scores? sounds like the 

latter, my reviews are very detailed and explain the different 

[12:08] <darksydephil> differnce 

[12:09] <darksydephil> where are my headphones lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> i just realized i need them today 

[12:11] <darksydephil> ok gonna tweet that we’re live 

[12:12] <darksydephil> simpletons love short reviews, not much else to say there, if you can’t take competent 
thought you just want to be fed a number score

Friday the 13th beta 

[12:18] <darksydephil> quickest it could arrive was late next week

[12:08] <darksydephil> gonna quickly get some last minute stuff and then get the steram going 
[12:08] <darksydephil> i hope everything works lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> yeah thats kind of the point of tomorrow, most of hte stream will be me talking with 
stream chatters 

[12:13] <darksydephil> ugh its not letting me use custom arenas...hold on 

[12:13] <darksydephil> stupid fing game, they changed it AGAIN this year apparently 

[12:18] <darksydephil> i seriously cant find how to change the fucking arena.... 

[12:18] <darksydephil> wtf did they do with this game this year, sigh 

[12:20] <darksydephil> yeah this makes no sense at all 

[12:21] <darksydephil> so you can download and create arenas 

[12:21] <darksydephil> but i dont see ANYWHERE you can actually select them 

[12:21] <darksydephil> it only shows the pre-made WWE arenas 

[12:21] <darksydephil> this is fing stupid, i can select match type, title, but not arena 

[12:22] <darksydephil> no kidding, but they don't show up lol 

[12:23] <darksydephil> ive got 6 custom Christmas arenas here 

[12:23] <darksydephil> and i can’t select them anywhere 

[12:23] <darksydephil> no teven in universe, in universe i can’t figure out how to even change a PPV 
[12:23] <darksydephil> this thing is a fucking mess 
[12:25] <darksydephil> how the hell do you create a show? 

[12:25] <darksydephil> the universe mode only has existing shows and i see no option to change anything about 
hte show besides the matches 
[12:26] <darksydephil> holy crap 




[12:26] <darksydephil> ok i see it 
[12:26] <darksydephil> wow.... 

[12:26] <darksydephil> they really messed htis game up 
[12:34] <darksydephil> ok almost got this figured out 
[12:34] <darksydephil> jesus its complicated now 

[12:35] <darksydephil> ok show created, once i figure out how to get this into universe we’re good to go 
[12:37] <darksydephil> ok simulating until december.... 

[12:37] <darksydephil> then i believe i change the show from here... i think lol 
[12:43] <darksydephil> i still dont know if this is fucking working lol 
[12:43] <darksydephil> if i do, the entire thing gets fucked up 

[12:43] <darksydephil> because you cant UNDO stuff in universe mode one its simined lol 
[12:43] <darksydephil> this game sucks 

[12:44] <darksydephil> you can't even delete the stupid promos they put into the ppvs 

[12:44] <darksydephil> which are completely pointless if you're simming a ppv, they're for developing your 

damn created character not sims 

[12:44] <darksydephil> these guys are idiots 

[12:47] <darksydephil> ive been sitting here for a half hour and still have no idea if this is going to work lol 
[12:47] <darksydephil> thats how bad this game is now 
[12:47] <darksydephil> such a mess 

[12:48] <darksydephil> im pretty sure im stuck with only 1 arena the entire hting too 

[12:48] <darksydephil> no way to change them at all 

[12:50] <darksydephil> ok i mjust going to do 1 arena, i give up on the rest 

[12:50] <darksydephil> setting up all the matches right now 

[12:52] <darksydephil> seriously, how about the two of you start acting your age 

[12:52] <darksydephil> i dont need this shit, so get over it or leave 

[12:55] <darksydephil> im almost ready to go

[12:20] <darksydephil> breath of the wild takes place entirely inside a toilet while Link is taking a dump 
between boss fights in the 3DO Zelda game

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161228-01 FFXV 20TH.LOG 

[11:40] <darksydephil> test 
[11:44] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> reading the comments on my FFXV review, interesting mix 

[11:44] <darksydephil> some people know how to disagree respectfully, others just show their amazing 

immaturity 

[11:45] <darksydephil> i also love the people that say the game was in development for 3 years, not 10, which is 
blatantly factually incorrect lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> I would never play a game for 50 hours that I Felt was a 6 out of 10 lol 

[11:52] <darksydephil> i dont get how its confusing when ive played FFXV more than any other game this year 

besides maybe overwatch 

[11:58] <darksydephil> I hope people show up for today's stream, since the weekend its been a VERY slow week 
[11:59] <darksydephil> i dont understand youtubes related channels system at all anymor 
[11:59] <darksydephil> why is it saying that reviewtechusa, the radbrad and digital foundry are similar to 
KOgaming...lol 

[11:59] <darksydephil> none of them review games 
[12:00] <darksydephil> yup 

[12:00] <darksydephil> still happens eery time a video si uploaded 

[12:01] <darksydephil> thecowboyboyfromhell213 i just worked 4 hours last night to review ffxv. no, i haven’t 
started the year end stuff yet 

[12:03] <darksydephil> viewers are nice, but ultimately its about participation, i.e how many people sub and 
cheer etc 

[12:03] <darksydephil> its not like youtube here where ad revenue is what makes it profitable 

[12:04] <darksydephil> thecowboyboyfromhell213 : twitter.com/theycalhnedsp is the answer to all of your 

questions, its why i post up a schedule every night 

[12:06] <darksydephil> ok lets get this stream started 

[12:08] <darksydephil> oh my god

[12:16] <darksydephil> fingers crossed everyone lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:29] <darksydephil> the story in ffl3 was also shit 

[12:29] <darksydephil> it seems that the stories in FF are now less of a focus 

[12:30] <darksydephil> i have no idea how that happened but it seems to be true 

[12:31] <darksydephil> this is why i cant wait to play ff4. the story is exceptionally good in that one 

[12:33] <darksydephil> how are they unique? 

[13:20] <darksydephil> you only pay mor emoney if you damaged the car or exceeded the mileage limitations on 
a lease lol 

[13:20] <darksydephil> neither of which we've done, we barely drive 

[13:34] <darksydephil> ive been talkign to the chat all stream so far lol 

[14:36] <darksydephil> i never found a demonwall lol 

[14:36] <darksydephil> why do they cryptically hide the good shit 

[14:42] <darksydephil> you want to wait for more loading to return to the car? lol 

[16:16] <darksydephil> ManyPeregrine81 if i dont make money doing this, i can't KEEP doing this, logical 
adults understand this 

[16:16] <darksydephil> so yeah, it is about views and profit overall 
[16:16] <darksydephil> wake up 
[16:23] <darksydephil> enough of him 

[16:27] <darksydephil> i hope he keeps making new accounts, its fun to keep banning that guy 
[16:27] <darksydephil> lol 

[16:32] <darksydephil> see you guys don’t understand, which is fine 

[16:33] <darksydephil> if i went and got another job outside of YT/streaming, id have to significantly cut back 
on what i put out here 

[16:33] <darksydephil> and FYI, whatever i’d make at any entry level job would not cover the losses 
[16:33] <darksydephil> so its like, go get another job and make less...it's counter productuve 
[16:33] <darksydephil> productive 
[16:33] <darksydephil> ive thought about this tons lol 

[16:34] <darksydephil> nah a game over a year on hiatus is dead, plus i deleted it ages ago 
[16:41] <darksydephil> i could never do security, i cant be on my feet all day long

[11:48] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:50] <darksydephil> me, i love this game 
[11:50] <darksydephil> just hope we dont suck 
[11:50] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:51] <darksydephil> not game of the year, but it’d pretty much a shoe in for a spot in the top 10 
[12:12] <darksydephil> finally got the twitch dashbaord to load properly! 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ok im going to start setting up the party 
[12:18] <darksydephil> ok stream is starting up now 

[12:43] <darksydephil> LOL this is twitch's stemming limit, of course its pixellated 
[12:43] <darksydephil> its shit 

[12:50] <darksydephil> FYI video quality is fine on my end, as ive said, its twitch stream quality being so damn 
low for this game 

[13:24] <darksydephil> walk away? i stayed in fucking place lolol 
[13:24] <darksydephil> stop talking out of your butt 




[13:34] <darksydephil> mccree shoudln't exist, he’s insanely stupid 

[13:35] <darksydephil> mccree does fucking sniper damage and has sniper range with a handgun thats faster 
than a sniper, gets instant reload and instant 6 shots 
[13:35] <darksydephil> its fucking stupidity 

[13:36] <darksydephil> and he shoots 500 times faster than widowmaker lol 

[13:36] <darksydephil> why do you think he’s used so much and widowmaker so little? come on use your heads 
[13:36] <darksydephil> because soldier is full auto 
[13:36] <darksydephil> thats why lol 

[13:43] <darksydephil> because twitch stream quality sucks and always has lol 
[13:43] <darksydephil> its why i left 

[13:44] <darksydephil> if it freezes on source, your connection isn’t good enough 

[13:53] <darksydephil> Tracer is not a lesbian. She’s asexual, because she’s a character in an FPS with no sex in 
it. lol 

[13:54] <darksydephil> D.Va is asexual, lol. these are characters in an FPS 
[13:55] <darksydephil> Tracer cannot be a lesbian 

[13:55] <darksydephil> because there is no sexual attraction in Overwatch, it’s a shooter game 

[13:55] <darksydephil> if Overwatch was a dating game or a sex game, then she’d have a sexual orientation lol 

[14:17] <darksydephil> break time 

[14:28] <darksydephil> ok we’re trying to set up 2nd session now 

[14:28] <darksydephil> guy who is supposed to join is playing bloodborne lol 

[14:31] <darksydephil> well this guy wont stop playing bloodborne so im inviting someone else 

[14:32] <darksydephil> well his name is armourlight but he had a 2nd account fo overwatch 

[14:32] <darksydephil> i kept sending him invites but he never accepted so...whatever lol 

[14:35] <darksydephil> im not awful, im just not good either lol 

[14:35] <darksydephil> i dont play enough to be 

[15:22] <darksydephil> im streaming at the bitrate limit that twitch allows, if your stream quality is bad either 

your internet sucks or twitch sucks, nothing i can do about it sadly 

[15:22] <darksydephil> sounds like it 

[15:30] <darksydephil> 500 bits is 5 bucks 

[15:30] <darksydephil> each bit is a penny 

[15:40] <darksydephil> YouTube.com/kogamingl 

[15:40] <darksydephil> thats the channel 

[15:54] <darksydephil> the best average player ever! lol 

[16:09] <darksydephil> WWE Slam Crate: entire box of leftover Wade Barrett and Alberto Del Rio shirts

[11:58] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:58] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[11:58] <darksydephil> should be live soon 

[11:59] <darksydephil> today is the 1 month anniversary of my return to twitch! 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i must talk about this on prestream 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ok stream going live ina sec 
[12:06] <darksydephil> hmm 

[12:06] <darksydephil> so ive been thinking about the january patreon goal 

[12:07] <darksydephil> i wanted to do a patrons choice playthrough again as the goal, but then i remembered, 
last time i did that was the summer and that was the month i didnt hit hte goal lol 

[12:07] <darksydephil> so now i dunno. people seemed to love patrons choice until that one dead summer month 

[12:07] <darksydephil> nah, rock band is dead, nobody is gonna care about that again lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> the throat is getting better slightly every day 

[12:17] <darksydephil> but it still gets tired/hoarse by the end of the stream 

[12:18] <darksydephil> Rousey says she doesnt even want to fight anymore, she wants to act lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> too bad she doesn’t realize the only reason she got acting roles is because she fights 




[12:19] <darksydephil> sadly ive determined nobody is going to watch another FF game right now 

[12:19] <darksydephil> especially just after ffxv and with other niche stuff going on like zelda 

[12:20] <darksydephil> to play it later 

[12:20] <darksydephil> yeah, but pokemon is almost done 

[12:20] <darksydephil> ive been told 2, 3 streams tops and its over 

[12:21] <darksydephil> yeah, autism isn’t a joke 

[12:21] <darksydephil> bye 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20161231-01 PATREON MP EVENT 3RD.LOG

[11:43] <darksydephil> yeah sadly people that buy into the hype got their balls crushed again last night and felt 
pretty butthurt 

[11:44] <darksydephil> so it looks like we’ll have a fully lobby for overwatch, but only 2-3 people for BF1 today 

[11:44] <darksydephil> oh well, i tried lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the restroom 

[11:55] <darksydephil> ok time to set up the stream, get the fanart etc going 
[11:57] <darksydephil> also today im going to try and capture at a higher bitrate 

[11:57] <darksydephil> since i captured at 3500kbpt for youtube on thursday and the videos turned out awful 

[11:57] <darksydephil> marie we'll see, i think overwatch is full though 

[12:15] <darksydephil> ok setting up the first lobby now 

[12:26] <darksydephil> ok stream just went live

[12:27] <darksydephil> bit twhoa wtf was that 

[12:27] <darksydephil> stream is corrupting lol 

[12:27] <darksydephil> i think twitch may be a bit messed up today 

[12:28] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:31] <darksydephil> tigerpowered im down for that 

[13:21] <darksydephil> theres seriously no way to stream this game on twitch and make it look good without 
preferential treatment lol 

[13:21] <darksydephil> 3500kbps is so ass for 60fps games 

[13:28] <darksydephil> according to streamlabs there have been no subs and cheers, wtf are you talking about? 
lol 

[13:28] <darksydephil> i just did 

[13:29] <darksydephil> call me an idiot, goodbye, dont care if you’re sub, you dont get to blatantly insult me 
[13:30] <darksydephil> i dont care what he was lol. literally sitting here talking shit, he can fuck off 
[13:43] <darksydephil> i love how everyone talks about damage dropoff with mccree, yet he still kills pharah 
and most charcaters from far range anyway lol 

[14:36] <darksydephil> anybody else want to play BF1 with us or will it just be us 3? 

[14:37] <darksydephil> yeah ive gotten nothing today, no cheers nad no subs 
[14:37] <darksydephil> so no shout outs either 
[14:37] <darksydephil> oh wait, someone subbed during break 
[14:37] <darksydephil> ok ill shout that out at the end of stream then 
[14:37] <darksydephil> nice thanks retro! 

[14:37] <darksydephil> and you someone 

[14:38] <darksydephil> if that guy gets on everyones nerves again, ill perm ban him 
[14:38] <darksydephil> i see him causin trouble in here 

[14:39] <darksydephil> codeyaha he’s shitting on my review style and then hes purposely trolling, asking me to 
play SFV which 1. i said im never playing again and 2. during a patron event stream which he knows i cant swap 
games 




[14:39] <darksydephil> basically, he's a fucking idiot 
[14:39] <darksydephil> nad idiots dont get free reign in here 
[14:40] <darksydephil> trying to get set up here 
[14:40] <darksydephil> but a player isn't responding, sigh 
[14:40] <darksydephil> now it may just be me and 1 person lol 

[14:40] <darksydephil> i have no idea why everyone wants overwatch and nobody wanted any other games 

[14:40] <darksydephil> i offered 7 lol 

[14:41] <darksydephil> goodbye to another idiot 

[16:08] <darksydephil> why do idiots keep saying bloodborne die? i dont own the game, i dont have any save 

data, its literally impossible, but dummies keep saying it 

[16:13] <darksydephil> i havent played this game enouh to know any maps lol 

[16:13] <darksydephil> i only played it twice and then these patron sessions 

[16:17] <darksydephil> theres nothing scary about the game gino, dont even fucking start
