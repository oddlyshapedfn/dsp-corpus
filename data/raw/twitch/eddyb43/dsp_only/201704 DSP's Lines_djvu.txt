[11:16] <darksydephil> I just loved the wording 

[11:17] <darksydephil> "DSP Swallows a hot load!" adn it's me eating hot pizza lol 

[11:17] <darksydephil> the people who downvoted were closet homos, not okay with their own sexuality haha

[11:08] <darksydephil> wow 

[11:08] <darksydephil> speedtest errored out, woudln’t even work 
[11:08] <darksydephil> the internet was on and off last night as well 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i was watching wwe network and it crappe dout, so i watched a blu ray, then it was back 
by the time the movie ended 





[11:12] <darksydephil> damn that picture wont even load fo rme lol 

[11:13] <darksydephil> if this doesn't resolve in like 30 minutes, looks like no stream today, which sucks ass

[11:16] <darksydephil> Test 

[11:16] <darksydephil> Ok on my phone again 

[11:17] <darksydephil> Can you lonk the pic again? 

[11:17] <darksydephil> LOL oh lord 

[11:18] <darksydephil> Lol welp internet completely died on the pc now 

[11:20] <darksydephil> Es encelor, its both of my internet lines as well. So not a ddos or anything 

[11:22] <darksydephil> Kind of messed up to not air what your scheduled to do and loop the same thing for 4 

hours though 

[11:23] <darksydephil> I can understand that people were upset 

[11:24] <darksydephil> The internet better work this fucking week 

[11:25] <darksydephil> If the internet doesnt work within an hour ill call Comcast 

[11:27] <darksydephil> The Comcast twitter account is checking on issues in the area right now 

[11:28] <darksydephil> Its kind of hard to stream with no internet bethe lol 

[11:31] <darksydephil> Blue blur that gsme sounds just like ff brave exvius 

[11:31] <darksydephil> Nhell nonwolf, cablevision back on the east coast was far worse 

[11:32] <darksydephil> They were the worst, couldnt figure out jack shit 

[11:33] <darksydephil> I dunno how i just hit halfway in danganronpa when ive completed 4 of 6 total chapters 
lol 

[11:35] <darksydephil> Pretty much all isps are throttling internet unless you pay for a business line 
[11:36] <darksydephil> This isnt throttling lol, it just plain doesnt work 

[11:37] <darksydephil> They cant throttle a business line, be youre contractually paying more to get the higher 
speeds. If they throttled you could sue 

[11:40] <darksydephil> Ok i think the internet might be back now 

[11:41] <darksydephil> Chairman Mao says: if internet out for 30 minutes? SUE THE ISP!!! 

[11:43] <darksydephil> internet seems back 

[11:43] <darksydephil> let me run a speed test 

[11:43] <darksydephil> speed test is working now 

[11:44] <darksydephil> speed test was successful 

[11:45] <darksydephil> nope, im downloading persona 5 tonight 

[11:45] <darksydephil> along with doing a ton of other stuff inc luding setting up my teespring again 
[11:46] <darksydephil> ok ill start setting up the stream 
[11:48] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[11:49] <darksydephil> Went step by step according to the instructions on the cup "he didn’t make the cup 
noodles right!" 

[11:49] <darksydephil> more like, people have made up their own ways to do it that they believe are better 

[11:50] <darksydephil> the water was boiling, it was right out of the coffeeemaker lol 

[11:50] <darksydephil> and it says nothing about replacing the lid on the package 

[11:50] <darksydephil> some people can’t accept that cup noodles suck ass lol 

[11:53] <darksydephil> ok folks, stream is starting momentarily 

[11:53] <darksydephil> fingers crossed 

[11:53] <darksydephil> btw did anyone cheer this morning? be nothing is pinned up

[11:56] <darksydephil> i ate some of them 

[11:56] <darksydephil> no way i was eating both of those salty bombs at once

[11:58] <darksydephil> internet is completely crapping out 

[11:58] <darksydephil> again 

[11:59] <darksydephil> and it says theres known issues in the area 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ive already done tons of streams of ME andromeda with stream chat interaction 
[12:00] <darksydephil> not going to change that now 
[12:01] <darksydephil> thats kind of the point lo 

[12:01] <darksydephil> yeah i think i may have to do more danganronpa today, sigh 

[12:04] <darksydephil> yeah my upload speed is supposed to be 20mbps and righ tnow its only 7 

[12:04] <darksydephil> its obvious they're working on something right now 

[12:04] <darksydephil> google fiber is only for those near google or at the one university 

[12:06] <darksydephil> centurylink is a joke 

[12:06] <darksydephil> they're slow as fuck lol 

[12:07] <darksydephil> they claim to have fiber but its slower than cable modem service 
[12:07] <darksydephil> theres nothing good availble here but Comcast, thats it 

[12:07] <darksydephil> ok so apparently Comcast is going to come visit today in the next 2 hours or so. so say 
the comcast support twitter 
[12:10] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:10] <darksydephil> well comcast is coming out here 
[12:10] <darksydephil> within 2 hours supposedly 
[12:10] <darksydephil> so we’ll see how that goes 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i doubt they'll find anything, because its never ever in the house. EVER, not once ever 
has that ever been the issue 
[12:12] <darksydephil> ok folks

[18:58] <darksydephil> adding the 1st batch of vids to playlis tnad then i'll be live with the new stream 
[19:00] <darksydephil> so daily more and more full time youtubers are saying they're forced to quit be ad 
revenue has plummeted so much since February, its incredibly sad actually 
[19:00] <darksydephil> someone just sent me another video and im seeing these almost daily now 
[19:04] <darksydephil> late? 

[19:04] <darksydephil> im here and going live momentarily 
[19:05] <darksydephil> whoa obs crashed 
[19:05] <darksydephil> hold up lol 

[19:06] <darksydephil> well the stream went down again hah 
[19:06] <darksydephil> obs had an issue, i just restarted

[19:10] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet that we've live then

[21:40] <darksydephil> howl at the last possible second 

[21:40] <darksydephil> cheering sniper hahaha 

[21:43] <darksydephil> goodnight all! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170406-01 PERSONA 5 5TH.LOG 

[11:06] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:07] <darksydephil> thanks! 

[11:07] <darksydephil> i got a 500 bit cheer at 7am lol 
[11:07] <darksydephil> sweet 

[11:09] <darksydephil> you can only write off the cost of an office if the room is used exclusively for business 
purposes 

[11:09] <darksydephil> in my case, i literally only come in here for work so im good 
[11:09] <darksydephil> that's correct errnoent 

[11:09] <darksydephil> square footage, cost of the business, income vs what you put out etc 

[11:10] <darksydephil> if done correctly then everythign you spend on the business can be written off and the 

room is a huge thing, if not done correctly you get audited lol 

[11:10] <darksydephil> nah im good, i already spoke to my tax attorney and if i dont get the info fast enough he’ 
going to get me an extension 

[11:13] <darksydephil> no, we have high sales tax here, so you pay high taxes if you choose to spend money, 
which is the RIGHT way to go about it 

[11:13] <darksydephil> in Connecticut you get not only high sales tax but state income tax as well, they literally 
rob you and the state is fucking terrible at spending the money they take from you 
[11:13] <darksydephil> AND high property tax too 
[11:14] <darksydephil> um, fuck no they dont! 

[11:14] <darksydephil> the roads are awful 
[11:14] <darksydephil> all in disrepair 

[11:15] <darksydephil> goldencolts, its not rich at all. a few rich people live there and drive the whole fucking 
economy up into a bracket where everyone pays insane taxes because of those few rich jerks 
[11:15] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up 

[11:17] <darksydephil> we’re probably going to look to buy a used car 

[11:17] <darksydephil> the reason we leased the bmw twice was because i wasn't sure i would be able to always 
afford it. and good thing thats what we did be look at the siituation now lol 

[11:18] <darksydephil> hybrids are out of the question, they cost far too much and we dont drive enough to get 





the fuel efficiency benefits, if we drove on teh highway all the time that would be a different story but everything 
is very close by to us 

[11:19] <darksydephil> honestly what we get will depend on what's around here available, so we have to start 
looking shortly 

[11:19] <darksydephil> we only have about 2.5 months left 

[11:20] <darksydephil> most car repair shops do basic maintenance on the cheap as well 
[11:20] <darksydephil> as long as your car is common and parts are easily available 
[11:21] <darksydephil> hows the stream? working for all? 

[11:22] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet htat we’re live 
[11:23] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 
[11:24] <darksydephil> thanks mythstorm 

[11:26] <darksydephil> yeah it sucks how unreliable public transit is here except for outside of large cities 

[11:26] <darksydephil> Leanna tried taking the bus for 3 months when she went to driving school, no 

exaggeration, it was late/broken down half he time 

[21:24] <darksydephil> whoa! Thanks Austin 

[21:24] <darksydephil> first after hours big cheer lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170407-01 PERSONA 5 6TH.LOG 

[11:00] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:01] <darksydephil> hows it goin all? 

[11:01] <darksydephil> im setting up right now, more Persona 5 today as it won the poll, so ME is tomorrow 
[11:04] <darksydephil> whoa 

[11:04] <darksydephil> i dropped from over 270 subs to 256 today... 

[11:04] <darksydephil> so i guess a LOT of peopels subs expired 
[11:05] <darksydephil> ok turning on the stream 

[11:07] <darksydephil> so the good news is that twitch streaming has been very profitable so far this week and i 
hope to keep it at that level all month 

[11:07] <darksydephil> the bad news is, even with the premiere of Persona 5, youtube was awful lol. it went up 
ever so slightly 

[11:08] <darksydephil> youtube is pretty much dead at this point 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i see almost no reason to focus on anything over there, imagine if id sunk all of my time 
into KOGaming...id be super fed right now 

[11:10] <darksydephil> yeah it seems that the only way to keep afloat doing this kind of job now is with massive 
crowdfunding and/or moving to Twitch anda streaming focus, unless you're already on top on youtube, its 
impossible to keep going 

[11:10] <darksydephil> chances are you guys are following channels that have a huge following, in which case 
they probably went from making massive money to just okay money 
[11:11] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[11:12] <darksydephil> let me put it this way. if a YT channel is making anywhere from 100k-500k total views a 
day, chances are they're not effected too badly by this 

[11:12] <darksydephil> right now on average im more in the 60k range so yeah, im definitely one of those that 
had to change to survive 

[11:13] <darksydephil> ok im going to tweet that we're live 
[11:16] <darksydephil> ok at the laptop now 

[11:16] <darksydephil> looks like everything is working so ill start in a sec here 

[11:17] <darksydephil> you guys forget the series was actually called POORLY cooking with the king lol

bits will show up on screen again 

[11:05] <darksydephil> yeah i got all the hard work done, may need to send the accountant additional info but it 
took about 3.5 hours, not too bad 

[11:06] <darksydephil> yup had to go through every credit card, paypal transaction etc to find sbusiness related 
stuff and WTF, am i glad i did as i had some random charges on pretty much every account that were business 
related 

[11:09] <darksydephil> yeah this should be interesting

[11:16] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet out that we’re live

[11:19] <darksydephil> not a big return, but a small return applied to next year's taxes 
[11:19] <darksydephil> which is awesome, sometimes i actually owe money 
[11:20] <darksydephil> and honestly, i dont have any to give them lol

[10:56] <darksydephil> well errnoent nothing is really going to change here, due to finances etc we're in no 
position to plan a wedding now 

[10:57] <darksydephil> LOL Youtube ad revenue is a mess now 

[10:57] <darksydephil> so on Saturday my views shot up, not surprising right? it was the weekend and people got 

caught up on persona and otehr stuff 

[10:58] <darksydephil> well ad revenue went DOWN 

[10:58] <darksydephil> which means because more people watched there weren’t enough ads to go around 
[10:58] <darksydephil> youtube is a joke now 

[11:05] <darksydephil> well just cleaned up the comments on my week in preview, a dozen idiots purged and the 
vid seems fine now 

[11:06] <darksydephil> whats hilarious is i blatantly explain everything about the engagement in that video, but 
a ton of idiots will ignore the video and still make shit up 
[11:07] <darksydephil> nobody cares, lol

[11:07] <darksydephil> everyone has already streamed/uploaded this boss 
[11:07] <darksydephil> and nobody had anything done to them 

[11:07] <darksydephil> ive had people spamming atlus's twitter account with every video fo P5 ive uploaded so 
far telling them to take me down 

[11:07] <darksydephil> thats not even an exaggeration mind you 
[11:07] <darksydephil> ive seen the tweets 

[11:09] <darksydephil> i proposed like every normal human: we mutually agreed to get married ages ago, looked 

at rings together, i picke done and told her id gotten it, we were waiting to take a trip for me to propose and it 

didnt happen so i just gave her the ring instead of waiting, you know, REALITY, unlike the overdramatic, 

unrealistic bullshit you see in movies and on tv 

[11:11] <darksydephil> the john cena proposal was fake, you know 

[11:11] <darksydephil> they'd been engaged for a while already 

[11:12] <darksydephil> i hate to say this, but overdramatic proposals and expensive rings are totally for suckers. 

Leanna purposely told me she didnt want an expensive ring because they’re so cliche and literally worthless, not 

worth the insane amount of money put into it 

[11:13] <darksydephil> diamonds aren’t valuable at all 

[11:13] <darksydephil> its a complete scam, a cntrolled market 

[11:14] <darksydephil> no, i purposely didnt theycallmejimbob 

[11:14] <darksydephil> im NOT John Cena lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i didnt stage the fucking thing for money 

[11:15] <darksydephil> going to run a test here 

[11:15] <darksydephil> i think i have the p5 stuff up bu ti wnat to check 

[11:15] <darksydephil> shit 

[11:15] <darksydephil> its not working 

[11:16] <darksydephil> wtf 

[11:16] <darksydephil> the on screen notifications arent working 
[11:16] <darksydephil> .... 

[11:17] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[11:17] <darksydephil> i have absolutely no idea why the messages aren’t working, wtf 
[11:18] <darksydephil> its set up for 250 buts 
[11:18] <darksydephil> bits 

[11:18] <darksydephil> but im running the test stuff and nothing is happening 
[11:19] <darksydephil> yeah, NONE Of the on screen notifications are working today 
[11:19] <darksydephil> i have no idea why not 

[11:19] <darksydephil> i just tried the ones for p5 and ofr ME andromeda and nothing is showing up sigh 
[11:20] <darksydephil> i dont know how muxy works, it could be server based 
[11:20] <darksydephil> i wish people would stop talking about alex jones though and focus lol 
[11:21] <darksydephil> id like to get the stream working 

[11:22] <darksydephil> MythStorm24 there is a manual test trigger that ive been trying and its not working 
[11:22] <darksydephil> so either it could bet that the test is broken or the entire thing doesn't work 
[11:22] <darksydephil> we wont know unless osmeone subs etc 

[11:33] <darksydephil> i dont think this is gion to work btw, that muxy message was 40 minutes ago and they 
thought they were back up and running apparently 
[11:34] <darksydephil> aha! 

[11:34] <darksydephil> i got it to work 

[11:34] <darksydephil> ill restart the stream now 

[11:48] <darksydephil> fuck

[19:06] <darksydephil> hello everyone 





[19:07] <darksydephil> im setting up the ME stream right now, shouldn’t take long 
[19:11] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up! 

[19:15] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[19:16] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[19:16] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we're live 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170411-01 YOOKA-LAYLEE 1ST.LOG 

[11:03] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:04] <darksydephil> doing the final tweaks right now before we start 
[11:05] <darksydephil> is this game as tough as banjo kazooie? 

[11:05] <darksydephil> as in, do you have to collect every item to unlock all stages 

[11:06] <darksydephil> GOOD, the on screen notifications are working today 

[11:06] <darksydephil> no tech issues so far lol 

[11:12] <darksydephil> ok stream should be going live in a sec 

[11:13] <darksydephil> apparently im almost done with ME Andromeda 

[11:13] <darksydephil> which came as news to me, ive barely played the story and i was told last night theres 
less than 2 hours left lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> apparently the actual story o fhte game is short as hell 
[11:14] <darksydephil> its just the tons of side content that make it long 
[11:15] <darksydephil> Overwatch is old news dude 

[11:15] <darksydephil> like, i still like the game, but most have moved on at this point 
[11:16] <darksydephil> ok resetting top cheer 
[11:17] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:17] <darksydephil> ok cool,l ill tweet that we're live 

[11:17] <darksydephil> for the record, i really dont know who jontron is nor do i care, therefore the 
"controversy" around this game is null and void for me, a non-issue 
[11:19] <darksydephil> this is why i dont give my political views lol 

[11:19] <darksydephil> i know people take that shit to heart, so seriously, they'll boycott your stuff if htey dont 
agree 100% in line with you 

[11:20] <darksydephil> im' not conservative or liberal, im me. i refuse to identify with a generatlized line of 
thinking because im not that simple minded lol. and that's all ill say before a fight erupts here over politics 
[11:21] <darksydephil> yes, its time for games, not politics 

[11:21] <darksydephil> YouTubers and let's players need to realize they're not political figureheads who need to 
stand on a soapbox spouting shit, they're not any more important than anyone else, and they’d best do well to 
learn that or else they'll all end up like jontron 
[11:22] <darksydephil> that is 100% true Zahvone 
[11:22] <darksydephil> and that's SAD 

[11:22] <darksydephil> because rational thought is based on intake of many different perspective and opinions 

[11:23] <darksydephil> you can’t figure out something without seeing it from different angles 

[11:23] <darksydephil> and when you refuse to accept half the perspectives you become ignorant 

[11:24] <darksydephil> ok im gonna start prestream and let's not turn this into politichat lol 

[16:09] <darksydephil> howl, its not that man. im really appreciative that you cheered! 

[16:09] <darksydephil> but you saw what happened, others who may have jumped into the top cheer game were 
basically turned off by it 

[16:09] <darksydephil> i think the best way to do it is to just keep going wtih the top cheer stuff and not trying to 
blow everyone out of the water 

[16:11] <darksydephil> stuart maybe not. because chances are, deep was going to spend those bits anyway over 
time, but other people stopped cheering when they saw that bomb drop lol 

[16:14] <darksydephil> well people are saying I spent $1-10k on Leanna's engagement ring when I blatantly 
explained on camera that it was only $200, so I’m sure people will say stupid shit about Persona as well 
Bammbino. They're just THAT dumb 

[16:15] <darksydephil> yeah they’re incredibly stupid, also saying that i’m "stealing" everyone’s money for a 




wedding and don’t need it. hwen i said, ON CAMERA, we're not getting married until i’m out of the financial 
shithole 

[16:16] <darksydephil> yes most people were very supportive so that was nice 

[16:17] <darksydephil> the entire SOK podcast this week will probably be wild, rampant, insulting speculation 
about he engagaement 

[16:17] <darksydephil> thats all they fucking do anyway lol 
[16:18] <darksydephil> bammbino is pretty much right 

[16:18] <darksydephil> when i started doing YT full time i sacrificed a ton of stuff

[18:59] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[18:59] <darksydephil> youtube had a bunch of errors apparently 

[18:59] <darksydephil> fixing that now

[19:03] <darksydephil> ok setting up now, should be live shortly 
[19:06] <darksydephil> i doubt we’ll have many viewers tonight 
[19:06] <darksydephil> but we’ll see! 

[19:08] <darksydephil> so far its pretty interesting honestly, never expected a really retro-feeling game like this 
to have modernized graphics etc 
[19:08] <darksydephil> and holy shit 

[19:08] <darksydephil> i just spent 4 hours in the first area and didnt figure everything out lol 
[19:08] <darksydephil> someone gave me a clue ina comment on stuff i missed 

[19:09] <darksydephil> in tekken i usually use paul, king and any other grapplers, wang, and a few others 

[19:09] <darksydephil> yeah i always messed with nina/ana 

[19:10] <darksydephil> people can't wait for another taste of wang 

[19:10] <darksydephil> yeah i dont think wang is in it actually lol 

[19:10] <darksydephil> too many new stupid characters 

[19:11] <darksydephil> the next few months are going to be VERY fighter-centric, which is good and bad. if you 
love fighters, you'll get a ton of fun stuff, but a lot of my viewers dont...so yeah lo 

[19:11] <darksydephil> yup. i gotta update my game release calender this week as i dont know what else is even 
out in may besides in justice 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ok let me head over to the loveseat and ill start talking

[11:07] <darksydephil> hello all! 

[11:09] <darksydephil> i'm pretty sure bioware is losing a ton of cred with gamers after andromeda, so if they're 
making a game like that, they're just continuing down that toilet path 
[11:13] <darksydephil> ok stream is giong live! 

[11:13] <darksydephil> the first release of Destiny was far worse than Borderlands 
[11:13] <darksydephil> but everyone seems to agree that the expansions made it better 
[11:15] <darksydephil> no way im playing another yakuza this year lol 
[11:18] <darksydephil> testing 

[11:18] <darksydephil> ok good stream chat is working

[11:04] <darksydephil> since it seems i can beat the game in 2 hours 

[11:04] <darksydephil> so it should be interesting, seems the side content is the glitchest shit 

[11:06] <darksydephil> i cant believe this game is almost over 

[11:06] <darksydephil> it honestly feels like i didnt do anything lol 

[ 11:07] <darksydephil> yeah ME 1 is actually a pretty short game if you dont die much 

[11:07] <darksydephil> but it was the first in a series, and they were doing something totally new/different

then just quietly stopped enforcing it after like 2-3 monts

[11:06] <darksydephil> thats how i noticed, it said "sign in to psn" 

[11:07] <darksydephil> it was in rest mode 
[11:07] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:09] <darksydephil> ok console finished, let me check it 
[11:10] <darksydephil> ok looks good 

[11:10] <darksydephil> let me get stuff finalized nad running! 

[11:12] <darksydephil> LOL i just got an email from EA, "please fill out this survey about mass effect 
andromeda" 

[11:14] <darksydephil> dr zombius made a new animation for subs, but its a generic one (not game specific) so 
we wont’ see it today 

[11:14] <darksydephil> ok stream is going live 
[11:16] <darksydephil> no, he killed himself 
[11:16] <darksydephil> so he got off way too easy 
[11:19] <darksydephil> ok cheer leader reset! 

[11:19] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab some drinks before we start 
[11:25] <darksydephil> ok back 

[11:25] <darksydephil> ill blow my nose and then we'll get started

[11:08] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:09] <darksydephil> wow, a whopping 500 people are playingYooka Laylee on twitch right now lol 
[11:09] <darksydephil> so twitch announced those new sub options publicly? 

[11:10] <darksydephil> they sent me a video with details about an upcoming beta but said "do not disclose any 
info to anyone" 

[11:10] <darksydephil> so someone posted it up despite the email saying not to lol. not surprising 

[11:10] <darksydephil> i mean, theres no legal ramifications to keep it private, that was just really dumb of them 

[11:11] <darksydephil> the email didnt even really explain how the higher subs benefit the viewer either, it was 






confusing 

[11:11] <darksydephil> im assuming a special set of emotes and/or badges 
[11:12] <darksydephil> resetting the top cheer 
[11:13] <darksydephil> id expect today to be a slow stream lol 
[11:14] <darksydephil> yes i did 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i believe i set it up that very same night 
[11:16] <darksydephil> ok gonna turn on the stream now 
[11:17] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:17] <darksydephil> lol just tested it, it works 

[11:18] <darksydephil> i think the biggest improvement twitch is doing is the ability to gift a sub 
[11:18] <darksydephil> so someone who's feeling generous can buy subs for other chatter/sviewers etc 
[11:19] <darksydephil> people have always wanted that and they're finally going to implement it 
[11:19] <darksydephil> i dont see how the new higher costing subs are going to work though, pretty confusing 
[11:20] <darksydephil> fuck no lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170420 ASK THE KING, NO STREAM.LOG 

[12:48] <darksydephil> no stream today! 

[12:48] <darksydephil> working on ask the king 

[19:19] <darksydephil> i dont archive the live streams here as i upload them to youtube 
[19:19] <darksydephil> you can find the playthrough here http://www.youtube.com/dspgaming 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170421-01 PERSONA 5 13TH (7-7 ATLUS HIATUS).LOG 

[11:10] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:13] <darksydephil> i never said that mobile gaming is better than 3ds/vita. i said that its more dominant and 
the way the market is heading, people in general don't care about the quality of mobile games, just that they're 
accessible and free 

[11:14] <darksydephil> that's correct, that doesn’t make them less popular, they're far more popular than "real" 
games on 3ds and vita now 

[11:16] <darksydephil> hopefully we get a good turnout since this is the "final" stream for a while 
[11:17] <darksydephil> that's right, risk my livelihood, sounds like a great idea lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> there are multiple instances of people being suspended for streaming after 7/7 and also 
having teir youtube channels getting striken with copyright strikes 

[11:21] <darksydephil> just because some people "got away with it" doesn’t make me immune 
[11:22] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:23] <darksydephil> urn....is the stream working? nobody responded 

[11:23] <darksydephil> ok thanks lol 

[11:23] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we're live then 

[11:27] <darksydephil> nope going to start talking right now 

[16:02] <darksydephil> thanks everyone for a great final stream! 

[16:02] <darksydephil> this really sucks, id love to keep playing 
[16:03] <darksydephil> nice MythStorm24 ! 

[16:03] <darksydephil> yeah i hope so KushiYakitori 

[16:04] <darksydephil> yeah danganronpa will resume probably in a week or so 
[16:04] <darksydephil> and i'lll balance that with new releases 

[16:05] <darksydephil> well we'll see. i certainly dont want to do an overload, the games are very long as well 
[16:07] <darksydephil> yeah the collection was parts 1 and 2 so makes sense to eventually play 2 
[16:07] <darksydephil> and supposedly im getting 3 for free as well, although im not allowed to play it right 
away lol 

[16:08] <darksydephil> no 

[16:08] <darksydephil> spike chunsoft/MIS USA contacted me and thanked me for playing the first game, said 
they thought it was excellent quality and helped promote their game so they're going to give me part 3 for free 
[16:10] <darksydephil> i dunno 





[16:10] <darksydephil> sadly konami is claiming all of my MGS playthroughs 

[16:10] <darksydephil> so its probably not gonna work out 

[16:11] <darksydephil> unless i find a managed partnership 

[16:12] <darksydephil> fullscreen is bad, low rev share compared to other partners 

[16:12] <darksydephil> and they dont offer managed partnership from what i can tell 

[16:13] <darksydephil> not really, all networks pretty much have the same exact benefits 

[16:14] <darksydephil> as in, some form of support line, possible promotion on their stuff (which never does 

anything), music partnerships (which they all have), usually nothing solid like free games or product campaigns 

which is what you really need to make money

[11:04] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:04] <darksydephil> what the heck are you talking about lol 

[11:06] <darksydephil> its the idiots streaming early despite the fact they're not supposed to 

[11:07] <darksydephil> you can’t help it anymore, it'll happen forever as long as game companies provide copies 

early and continue to support the insane practice of early reviews 

[11:09] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 

[11:09] <darksydephil> we’ll be running shortly 

[11:11] <darksydephil> ok going live now

[11:20] <darksydephil> Kappa 
[11:20] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> lol the twitch dashboard is such a buggy mess 

[11:21] <darksydephil> it was telling me i was stemming far too high of a bitrate, so i refreshed and now it says 
"excellent!" 

[11:22] <darksydephil> ok prestream time 
[11:22] <darksydephil> damn it 

[11:23] <darksydephil> my nose started running just as i was gonna talk 
[11:23] <darksydephil> one sec lol 
[11:23] <darksydephil> ok back 
[11:23] <darksydephil> here we go 

[15:40] <darksydephil> i think my computer just crashed lolol 
[15:41] <darksydephil> yeah wtf 

[15:41] <darksydephil> this is a REALLY bizarre windows error they 
[15:41] <darksydephil> then 

[15:41] <darksydephil> windows drivers must have crashed 
[15:41] <darksydephil> i have to restart the stream i think lol 
[15:42] <darksydephil> im restarting the stream now 
[15:42] <darksydephil> lol 

[15:42] <darksydephil> its a windows issue, drivers must have completely crashed 

[15:43] <darksydephil> ok restarting now lol 

[15:43] <darksydephil> we have like 15 minutes left on stream! 

[15:43] <darksydephil> not giving up yet

[11:02] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:03] <darksydephil> no idea YaCherdy becuase i dunno whats actually in that final tower 

[11:04] <darksydephil> no, im going to finish up the stuff in the final world and maybe even backtrack a bit now 

that i have all of the powers 

[11:06] <darksydephil> ok stream will be live shortly 
[11:08] <darksydephil> we're down to 218 subs :( 

[11:08] <darksydephil> the lack of new releases this month really killed it 
[11:08] <darksydephil> hopefully next month we boost up again 
[11:14] <darksydephil> stream working for all? 

[11:15] <darksydephil> ok cool, time to twee that we’re live 

[11:18] <darksydephil> thanks tantamounter for the first cheer of the day! 

[11:18] <darksydephil> i didnt 
[11:18] <darksydephil> it did it by itself 

[11:19] <darksydephil> i guess a dashboard update figured it out 
[11:20] <darksydephil> why would i replay it? 

[11:20] <darksydephil> i did all of the meaningful content 
[11:20] <darksydephil> ok prestream time 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170425-01 OUTLAST 2 1ST.LOG 

[11:03] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:05] <darksydephil> looks like ive got some last minute stuff to set up 
[11:05] <darksydephil> so give me a sec 

[11:08] <darksydephil> apparently twitch changed a bunch of stuff overnight 
[11:08] <darksydephil> they enabled the $9.99 and $24.99 subs 

[11:08] <darksydephil> they added a ton of new emotes, so i can now add like 4-5 new ones including ones just 
for those premium sub tiers 

[11:09] <darksydephil> and everyone is complaining about this new english only chat thing, i have no idea what 
that is though lol 

[11:09] <darksydephil> it didn’t seem to affect me on pc 
[11:15] <darksydephil> stream will be live shortly! 

[11:16] <darksydephil> wrong, lol 

[11:16] <darksydephil> the game takes 5 hours to beat if you rush through it, skipping all lore and never fail. i.e. 
a speedrun 

[11:16] <darksydephil> im tired of people speedrunning games like this and saying they're too short, no, you're 

just a moron trying to be negative 

[11:17] <darksydephil> stream starts momentarily 

[11:18] <darksydephil> so since this game runs at 60fps, im playing at 720p res just like i did with resident evil 7 

[11:18] <darksydephil> nobody seemed to have an issue with that so, yeah 

[11:21] <darksydephil> yeesh, my laptop is running like molasses today 

[11:21] <darksydephil> needs a restart badly later tonight 

[11:21] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna grab some drinks 

[11:24] <darksydephil> didnt get any fan art for outlast 2 

[11:25] <darksydephil> but we've got new popup messages for cheers, subs and tips 

[11:26] <darksydephil> because im not playing this on ps4 

[11:26] <darksydephil> it wasn't available online 

[11:26] <darksydephil> on psn that is 

[11:26] <darksydephil> only xbox one 

[11:27] <darksydephil> ok prestream starts in a sec 

[11:27] <darksydephil> i forgot to tweet that we're live lol 





[11:27] <darksydephil> oops 
[16:15] <darksydephil> no 

[16:15] <darksydephil> the goal was hidden in a side room that's not obvious to find 
[16:15] <darksydephil> that was the problem 

[16:16] <darksydephil> it wasn't even in the path that's obvious to tak ethrough that area 
[16:16] <darksydephil> that one segment was awful lol 
[16:17] <darksydephil> that's part of the problem though 

[16:18] <darksydephil> if you have a crazy insta-kill woman chasing you, how can you be expected to fully 
explore every single area 

[16:18] <darksydephil> the answer: you can’t, you'd would have had to get lucky and stumble upon that door 
before you ever found the hook 

[16:18] <darksydephil> that's awful game design, the game should have put you at that door first, THEN off to 
find the hook. 

[16:19] <darksydephil> to be fair, there were a few things in Outlast 1 I got stuck on, but not for more than a few 
minutes since the maps were all indoors, so even getting confused it didn't take long to figure out 
[16:20] <darksydephil> but now you're in an open world...some people might take a hour to figure out that 
puzzle lol 

[16:22] <darksydephil> yeah, i guarantee i wouldn’t have even raised it as a negative point if i’d been lucky 
enough to stumble upon that grating/door first and KNEW that's where to go back to 
[16:23] <darksydephil> but that's the game devs job: to guide you there first, they didn’t at all, in fact the 
placement of the woman led me in the other direction lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170425-02 OUTLAST 2 2ND.LOG 

[18:50] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[18:51] <darksydephil> yeah but that last video is 30 minutes long, because its a god awful "puzzle" they did a 
bad job on 

[18:52] <darksydephil> its just my old Resident Evil shirt Derich, nothing special lol 
[18:52] <darksydephil> yeah I have no idea how much longer is in the game 
[18:52] <darksydephil> we may finish it right now on stream 
[18:53] <darksydephil> evening ratchefanl2 

[18:53] <darksydephil> actually, you know what? BRB, gonna swap the batteries in my xbox one controller 
[18:53] <darksydephil> just to be safe lol 

[18:57] <darksydephil> i saw a playthrough on YT, full game, at like 5 hours 18 minutes but it was pretty much 
a speedrun knowing what to do 

[18:57] <darksydephil> it was made purposely to make the game look short lol. didnt read any logs or anything 
[19:00] <darksydephil> ok getting set up right now 
[19:00] <darksydephil> allow me to reset top cheer.... 

[19:00] <darksydephil> thanks howl for that earlier! 

[19:01] <darksydephil> btw i just withdrew my tips paypal, a nice chunk to help with these bills this week, pretty 
awesome 

[19:03] <darksydephil> commercial? 

[19:03] <darksydephil> WTF is that ??? 

[19:03] <darksydephil> LOLOL 

[19:03] <darksydephil> ok thats coming THROUGH my xbox one 

[19:03] <darksydephil> i thi nk 

[19:04] <darksydephil> what the fuck 

[19:04] <darksydephil> okay i took care of it hahahah 

[19:04] <darksydephil> somehow there were background popups on my pc, no idea where they even came from 
[19:04] <darksydephil> those weren't porn ads, that was for a car or something, weird 
[19:05] <darksydephil> i did just log into email a few places and paypal, maybe those assholes actually 
employed popup window ads 
[19:05] <darksydephil> ok 




[19:05] <darksydephil> let me tweet that we're live, then we'll chat a bit, then we'll start 


-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170426-01 OUTLAST 2 3RD FINALE & EDITH FINCH 1ST.LOG 

[11:05] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:06] <darksydephil> setting up now! 

[11:07] <darksydephil> should be live shortly 

[11:08] <darksydephil> im sure it does 

[11:10] <darksydephil> ok thanks howl 

[11:10] <darksydephil> thats pretty much what i figured 

[11:10] <darksydephil> you can’t beat this in 5 hours unless you already know the solution to everything and you 
skip ALL the lore 

[11:11] <darksydephil> im pretty sure you can do that with every game ever and beat them quickly lol 
[11:11] <darksydephil> but no, instead let's talk shit about outlast 2 and say it's short 
[11:12] <darksydephil> its not a matter of getting stuck 

[11:12] <darksydephil> even getting stuck, ive only extended the length of my playthrough by maybe an hour 
[11:12] <darksydephil> the point is, it takes time to solve puzzles, explore, and read the lore 
[11:13] <darksydephil> if you're playing a survival horror game and purposely skipping all the logs that tell the 
story, you're playing it very wrong 

[11:14] <darksydephil> well the first game’s story was a lot more simple but also kind of just thrown at you. 95% 
of the story was mistreatment/experimentation on patients, then all of a sudden the last hour is like GHOSTS!!! 
[11:15] <darksydephil> this game so far, its very tough to figure out what's going on. its not coherent since you 
have two plotlines going on: the christians/heretics and then the school/suicide one from the past 
[11:16] <darksydephil> yeah didnt the protagonist of Outlast get possessed by the Wallrider at the end? 

[11:17] <darksydephil> i wonder if Outlast 1 and 2 will tie together, don't spoil if you know though, let's find out 
together here on stream 

[11:18] <darksydephil> ok stream working well? 

[11:19] <darksydephil> stream is working then? okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:19] <darksydephil> im chatting with you all here, of course im not talking yet 

[11:20] <darksydephil> ok moving over to the loveseat now 

[11:20] <darksydephil> gotta get some of my v8 in me before we start lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> ugh. of all the v8 drinks, its kiwi melon that tastes most like veggies lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> its pretty weird 

[15:09] <darksydephil> okay 

[15:09] <darksydephil> stream SHOULD be back for you guys now 

[15:09] <darksydephil> okay cool 

[15:09] <darksydephil> ill head back to the couch lol

[11:07] <darksydephil> another multi-game stream. 3 of these this week, well technically the yooka-laylee one 
was q&a 

[11:09] <darksydephil> i hope there are more wacky deaths 
[11:09] <darksydephil> jumping off a swing into the ocean was pretty funny 
[11:10] <darksydephil> i made an entire video on this last night worldwarl4s 
[11:10] <darksydephil> check my vlogging channel 

[11:11] <darksydephil> ok brb gonna grab drinks, then i’ll tweet that we’re live

[11:17] <darksydephil> im good, just getting set up here 

[11:17] <darksydephil> looking forward to a fun stream 

[11:17] <darksydephil> im about 45 minute sinto this game 





[11:17] <darksydephil> and ive heard its only like 2 hours long 
[11:17] <darksydephil> yeah its incredibly short apparently 

[11:18] <darksydephil> if you were to omit all scenes in kane & lynch 2 that were just the protagonists running 
around naked, this game is longer 
[12:05] <darksydephil> test

[11:03] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:03] <darksydephil> huh? 

[11:06] <darksydephil> so this game today is apparently another short indie 

[11:06] <darksydephil> only about 4 hours long 

[11:07] <darksydephil> so we may finish it all in one sitting 

[11:08] <darksydephil> the stream title is correct? 

[11:08] <darksydephil> did you try refreshing 
[11:08] <darksydephil> ok great 

[11:10] <darksydephil> i should be able to share that by tomorrow OmegajOker 
[11:10] <darksydephil> we’ll see 

[11:11] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna grab drinks, then i’ll tweet that we're live 
[11:13] <darksydephil> ok time to reset top cheer 
[11:14] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:14] <darksydephil> no sound?! 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i heard the dashboard theme 
[11:15] <darksydephil> there's sound akio fyi 
[11:17] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[11:18] <darksydephil> i apparently was already verified, it doesn't mean anything on twitch lol 
[11:20] <darksydephil> so i enabled the ability to do sales of games through amazon a month ago, nothing ever 
happened with it, then i get an email "you should enable games sales for extra profit." i checked partner settings 
and it's enabled, so apparently it doesn't work lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> i dont even know HOW it's supposed to work, like will an ad for whatever game i'm 
playing pop up during a stream so you can buy the game on amazon? i have no idea 
[11:22] <darksydephil> lol great 

[11:22] <darksydephil> i bet some people would actually use it 

[11:22] <darksydephil> people tell me all the time they get games be they see my streams/vids of a game they 
didn’t know about 

[11:23] <darksydephil> ok everybody ready for prestream?
