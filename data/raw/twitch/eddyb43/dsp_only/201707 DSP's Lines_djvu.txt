[12:33] <darksydephil> okay

[12:34] <darksydephil> got some fanart, nice 

[12:37] <darksydephil> ive got good Patreon news today, sweet 

[12:43] <darksydephil> why do i need a death counter for a game made for quick and easy deaths, this isn’t dark 
souls 

[12:44] <darksydephil> exactly, in a game wehre theresr potential to die a million times in a very short period, 
theres no point in a death counter, more of a hassle than anything else to have to constantly update it 
[12:44] <darksydephil> and ill forget anyway 
[12:44] <darksydephil> okay so stream is working fine? 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live then 

[12:47] <darksydephil> call me daddy again and you'll enjoy a nice timeout lol 
[12:47] <darksydephil> that shit is creepy man 

[12:48] <darksydephil> im pretty sure no streamer would enjoy being called daddy by their viewing audience lol 

[12:48] <darksydephil> im pretty sure im no father figure! holy crap 

[12:49] <darksydephil> so this collection was $40 

[12:49] <darksydephil> hopefully people like it and it gets some traction 

[12:50] <darksydephil> wait its only 30fps?? seriously 1?!?! 

[12:50] <darksydephil> i fucking though tit was 60 
[12:50] <darksydephil> shit 

[12:50] <darksydephil> i gotta restart the stream then 
[12:50] <darksydephil> its set up wrong 
[12:50] <darksydephil> i was told it was 60 lol 
[12:50] <darksydephil> ok brb gonna restart 

[12:53] <darksydephil> i guess he thought i was joking or something 
[12:54] <darksydephil> okay stream should be back at 1080p/30fps now 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170702-01 CRASH 3 2ND.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> hello al 
[12:29] <darksydephil> all 

[12:29] <darksydephil> wow first line i type is a typo lol 

[12:30] <darksydephil> yeah yesterday someone tipped me and called me Dave so it's a running joke now 
[12:31] <darksydephil> hotsauceistoohot: drinking an energy drink at noon doesn't keep me up at 2am. just 
saying, that pretty much defies science 

[12:32] <darksydephil> hotsauceistoohot again, ill say it: you don’t understand basic science, please stop now. 
[12:32] <darksydephil> it's like arguing with a flat earther. 

[12:33] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> we’re already got some muttonheads here today i see 
[12:34] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:35] <darksydephil> ok brb grabbing drinks 

[12:39] <darksydephil> anyone else want to spew some nonsense before we get started? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i figure we’ll make it easy on the mods by just banning your dumb asses now lol 
[12:41] <darksydephil> hotsauceistoohot ive talked about this topic numerous times with full explanations why, 
you just didn’t listen or weren’t around and im not going to fully repeat myself just for you 
[12:42] <darksydephil> as it is my schedule is working for now so i have no idea how this is your concern either 
[12:42] <darksydephil> so how about you just sit back, enjoy the stream and stop being so intrusive? 

[19:56] <darksydephil> what an idiot

normal enemy you have to avoid lol

[12:38] <darksydephil> we’ll see, i want to play every stage at least once but im not going to spend tons of hours 

redoing the same shit over and over 

[12:40] <darksydephil> um, pasta is actually supposed to be cooked al dente at all times, but I actually 
overcooked it a bit more than that, so you fail xthewrath93x

[12:32] <darksydephil> ollyorange : becuase i dont have money to blow 

[12:34] <darksydephil> i have no idea what the dies cost, but i can put any funds to better use than to play a 
character once and never again 

[12:35] <darksydephil> im only playing as batman and aquaman today, maybe darkseid, be thats all i can 
remember lol. can’t even really remember darkseid 
[12:37] <darksydephil> okay stream working?

[19:21] <darksydephil> its always like that with fighting games 

[19:22] <darksydephil> yup stupid "stream monster" idiots gotta come on and shit all over the place 
[19:25] <darksydephil> its part fact, part act. like im not THAT ANGRY most of the time if i lose, i realize 
online play is shit 

[19:25] <darksydephil> but i let that innate anger just explode and people react to it lol 

[19:25] <darksydephil> most people wont’ do that on a stream because they want people to come back and watch 
them constantly play that same game to make money etc 

[19:26] <darksydephil> i dont care, because i dont only play one kind of game, i can shit on USF2 tonight and 
play it again in a week 

[19:26] <darksydephil> if i ONLY plays USF2 and shat on it constantly, that wouldn’t work lol 

[19:26] <darksydephil> you do notice though, i will quit games i hate, like SFV. i’m never playing that piece of 

shit again 

[19:29] <darksydephil> ive been covering fighting games since the launch of SFIV. and ive never changed, its 
the viewing audience that did 

[19:29] <darksydephil> i won’t suck a game dev's dick over a game to get more people to watch lol 
[19:30] <darksydephil> it was like 300 idiots from 4chan coming in here 
[19:30] <darksydephil> they didn’t even understand fighting games lol 
[19:30] <darksydephil> the dregs of society 

[19:34] <darksydephil> holy fuck, i can do all the gief combos now 
[19:34] <darksydephil> lol

[12:26] <darksydephil> um, this isn't a redemption run 

[12:26] <darksydephil> so stop this shit already, because im not gonna have drama-filled debates 
[12:26] <darksydephil> im here to play a game and have fun, and the only guarantee is no dick lightningin spam 
[12:27] <darksydephil> anybody bitching about stream chat interaction in a stream where ive been massively 
interacting with chat since March can be shown the door right now lol

[12:31] <darksydephil> wow apparently 2 people subbed at like 9 in the morning 
[12:31] <darksydephil> nice! 

[12:33] <darksydephil> ok got some fanart to add and then we’ll get started 

[12:34] <darksydephil> ratchefanl2 : closet homosexuals probably, can't fess up to their own sexuality, ashamed 
of it. Men who are confident in their sexuality don’t care if other guys are shirtless 

[12:34] <darksydephil> i mean fuck, i watch wrestling every week and im not triggered by dozens of shirtless 
guys 

[12:35] <darksydephil> okay stream starting now 
[12:36] <darksydephil> 4 thousand pixels you can't see 

[12:37] <darksydephil> i like how Dead ambrose went off script on commentary this week and tore into teh 





Great Balls of Fire ppv name, he was like "who the hell named it that? it's it the stupidest thing ever?" and the 

other commentators were dead silent 

[12:37] <darksydephil> DEAN ambrose, not dead 

[12:38] <darksydephil> no games today, it's only serious business 

[12:39] <darksydephil> if your first comment is a bitch comment, you can enjoy a time out lol 

[12:40] <darksydephil> im trying to remember, this is the one with the giant dead king you fight, right? dont 

remember if he was optional or not 

[12:41] <darksydephil> i do remember this one has a bajillion fucking skeletons and tons of optional orders you 
can complete it in 

[12:41] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:41] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:48] <darksydephil> it stands for Kicked Out of stream chat for being a worthless turd 

[15:29] <darksydephil> im back 

[15:29] <darksydephil> enjoy the ban nexx lol 

[17:21] <darksydephil> i love it when you braindead trolling idiots show up for dark souls streams 
[17:21] <darksydephil> the only downside is we get legitimately nice people who get turned off by the morons 
[17:21] <darksydephil> and i can't moderate because im playing the game 
[17:22] <darksydephil> yeah i saw that Zordon666 

[17:22] <darksydephil> the guy was just being nice and the fuckwads didn't like that one bit 
[17:22] <darksydephil> hopefully he’ll come back 

[17:23] <darksydephil> okay time to upload these videos, see you guys tonight 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170705-02 DARK SOULS 2 SCHOLAR 2ND.LOG

[19:39] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[19:40] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet 

[19:41] <darksydephil> yeah someone on stream earlier was saying hter ewas an audio delay, but i checked the 
vids and they're fine 

[19:41] <darksydephil> so any delay must have been a twitch issue 
[22:01] <darksydephil> great stream folks! tons of progress 
[22:01] <darksydephil> i seriously hope theres a bonfire here lol 
[22:01] <darksydephil> okay well, a shortcut back works too 
[22:01] <darksydephil> hopefully its close, 

[22:01] <darksydephil> yeah that would pretty much erase my progress mouse lol 
[22:01] <darksydephil> no thanks 

[22:02] <darksydephil> okay see you all tomorrow, thanks for a great night stream 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170706-01 DARK SOULS 2 SCHOLAR 3RD.LOG 

[12:30] <darksydephil> hello folks 
[12:30] <darksydephil> stream going live now 
[12:32] <darksydephil> hope i can get power stance today 
[12:32] <darksydephil> guess we’ll see 

[12:33] <darksydephil> DreamVoyagerF : yes. Happy Birthday Mr Lion 
[12:35] <darksydephil> whoa! 

[12:35] <darksydephil> thanks MsMonique ! We didnt even start yet haha 
[12:35] <darksydephil> last giant is dead, so is the dragonrider 
[12:36] <darksydephil> right now im in the stupid shipyard area that sucks ass 
[12:36] <darksydephil> i seriously hate this area from the first game 
[12:36] <darksydephil> and i only have one estus left lol 
[12:36] <darksydephil> using a torch means no shield 





[12:37] <darksydephil> ill probably give it a shot if it doesn’t majorly interfere with other stuff 
[12:37] <darksydephil> i.e. if it releases before my time off. if during, theres pretty much no point 
[12:37] <darksydephil> okay stream working everyone? 

[12:37] <darksydephil> cool let me tweet 

[12:44] <darksydephil> theres an animated salt emote? lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> i didnt even know you could make animated emotes 

[12:44] <darksydephil> derich it sure sounds that way 

[12:45] <darksydephil> i guess you can tell theres hype when we’re getting in good cheers and i haven’t said a 
word yet lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> later Derich 

[17:05] <darksydephil> there is no rule to any of this shit, it's all an "honor code" by online idiots who think it 
actually makes them have a bigger dick if they artificially increase dificulty in something 
[17:05] <darksydephil> luckily i dont give a shit about appeasing those said idiots 
[17:06] <darksydephil> EricEEricson : its not hard to unplug the ethernet cable 

[17:07] <darksydephil> by the way, im pretty close to finding the blacksmith that makes the boss weapons, aren’t 
i? 

[17:08] <darksydephil> i remember it being in this area be those bugs are coming up 

[17:08] <darksydephil> I BETTER NOT GET HER FUCKING KILLED THIS TIMEi also better not kill the old 
man in the chair so i can fight darklurker lol 

[17:09] <darksydephil> Zahvone pink lemonade was my fave flavor, also fruit punch and the lemon lime one. i 
hated the blue one 

[17:09] <darksydephil> and watermelon too, tasted fake 

[17:10] <darksydephil> i dunno, i only had the pink before 

[17:11] <darksydephil> igoturcorona i might see it during my time off actually 

[17:17] <darksydephil> i think theres an option you have to turn off 

[17:17] <darksydephil> about Vodcasting 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170706-02 CRASH 3 4TH.LOG 

[19:26] <darksydephil> yo 

[19:26] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[19:26] <darksydephil> actually doing the dsii vids playlist first, then starting this tream 
[19:26] <darksydephil> stream 

[19:27] <darksydephil> dude twitter is astoundingly fun right now 

[19:27] <darksydephil> its like every braindead idiot is crying in unison 

[19:27] <darksydephil> its cool Derich 

[19:30] <darksydephil> probably once the sub expires 

[19:31] <darksydephil> they've mass reported me a ton of times 

[19:32] <darksydephil> im not breaking any rules of anything so its just more wasted time, Twitch just blows it 
off 

[19:32] <darksydephil> that....is some name isukfartsoutofaskunksass 
[19:32] <darksydephil> just some leftovers Derich, nothing special 
[19:32] <darksydephil> Zahvone copyright of what? 

[19:33] <darksydephil> yeah i own it and am renewing it, but its a moot point, if anybody else tried to get it, they 
have to provide a long running history of making gameplay videos and being called darksydephil, which they 
can’t 

[19:34] <darksydephil> even if they paid to get the trademark, if they tried to do anything legally with it, they'd 
be stripped of it lol 

[19:35] <darksydephil> exactly Zahvone. it would be utterly useless, they'd actually pay a minimum of $500 or 
more to get a trademark they'd lose the instant they tried to do anything with it, because it can't be upheld in a 
court of law 

[19:37] <darksydephil> ok starting up stream now 
[19:41] <darksydephil> okay, stream working? 




[19:42] <darksydephil> ok great, tweeting it out now 

[19:44] <darksydephil> you wont get a straight answer from this chat lol 

[19:44] <darksydephil> I'm actually Muppet Man, which explains a lot 

[19:45] <darksydephil> ShyGuysaysHi i dont play full games outside of work, just some mobile game stuff on 
iphone

or something 

[12:45] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[12:46] <darksydephil> i remember something in that misty part of the woods, an NPC that gives a quest for 
something great and sells good shit, but i didnt find them yet 

[12:46] <darksydephil> the problem is you can't target the fuckers, and my build doesn't have big sweeping 
strikes to hit them 

[17:02] <darksydephil> ok everyone 
[17:03] <darksydephil> dont go anywhere folks

[20:07] <darksydephil> ok is the stream name correct now?

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170708-01 DARK SOULS 2 SCHOLAR 6TH.LOG

[12:39] <darksydephil> would have been nice to fall asleep before around 6:30am when i finally passed out 
[12:41] <darksydephil> the only update i have Nich2440 is exactly what you’d expect from youtube, and ill talk 
about it as the stream starts 

[12:42] <darksydephil> this has nothing to do with pent up energy, come on now 

[12:42] <darksydephil> its obviously a stress related issue 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay starting up the stream 

[12:45] <darksydephil> hopefully we have mods today 

[12:45] <darksydephil> i predict tons of trolling after last night 

[12:46] <darksydephil> may have to go sub only if it gets bad enough 

[12:46] <darksydephil> thanks gamemaster2003isdead 

[12:46] <darksydephil> ok brb gonna grab drinks 

[12:57] <darksydephil> Goldencolts : were you here last night?

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170709-01 DARK SOULS 2 SCHOLAR 7TH.LOG 

[11:24] <darksydephil> settting up 
[11:24] <darksydephil> of course! 

[11:24] <darksydephil> wait a minute 

[11:25] <darksydephil> did i already get a 2400 cheer? wow! 

[11:25] <darksydephil> well we have good news and bad news today, ill discuss on prestream 
[11:29] <darksydephil> nice, i got new fanart! 

[11:30] <darksydephil> yes 

[11:32] <darksydephil> blue_blur64 : monetization, no. but id lose my partnership and be banned from any 
others, so its just as bad 

[11:32] <darksydephil> id have to wait until like, October to be repartnered 

[11:34] <darksydephil> wow even MORE fanart 

[11:34] <darksydephil> i just added it 

[11:35] <darksydephil> 2 new fanarts today 

[11:37] <darksydephil> actually stuart my pc can stream 1080p/60fps but i can’t both capture AND stream 
simultaneously without massive frame drops, i think what most Twitch streamers do is just auto-archive the 





streams and dump them raw onto youtube, but i dont do that, i split into parts etc 
[11:37] <darksydephil> stream working fore verone? 

[11:37] <darksydephil> wtf 

[11:38] <darksydephil> lets try that again 

[11:38] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:39] <darksydephil> stuart: youtube lets you stream at unlimited bandwidth, so i could stream at 9k AND 
record at 9k quality. Twitch only allows 6k, so forcing the CPU to encode at two completely different bitrates 
simultaneously is what kills it 

[11:44] <darksydephil> your bowels had better be ready! lol 
[18:08] <darksydephil> hold up 
[18:08] <darksydephil> guess what all? 

[18:08] <darksydephil> got a new response from Curse 

[18:08] <darksydephil> after showing them all the info and that the claims came from a gmail account, they 
believe the claims are 100% bogus too 

[18:09] <darksydephil> they said to file counter notifications, but also keep following up with ROckstar to see if 
they'll intervene 

[18:09] <darksydephil> but the good news is, obviously Curse won’t drop me if we both think the stirkes are 
bogus

[11:24] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:24] <darksydephil> im obviously running a bit behind, writing a few emails in celebration of today's news

[11:46] <darksydephil> i seriously can't believe youtube removed the strikes like this 
[11:46] <darksydephil> its the first time ever they've admitted fault 
[11:46] <darksydephil> and done something right 
[11:46] <darksydephil> is this a sign of....change?!? 

[11:47] <darksydephil> you guys have no idea, this is one of the best days in my entire run doing this as a job 
[11:47] <darksydephil> by far 

[11:48] <darksydephil> nah we honestly need a new intro

[15:41] <darksydephil> its legit, they also sent an email 
[17:19] <darksydephil> the trolls are so salty 
[17:19] <darksydephil> they're forming conspiracy theories about it 

[17:19] <darksydephil> like I lied about the Atlus strike and the rockstar strikes to make money 
[17:20] <darksydephil> they just posted a thread on Neogaf about it, with zero evidence of anything

[19:29] <darksydephil> hello! 

[19:30] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[19:31] <darksydephil> soooo whats sad right now, is youtube ad revenue, its been halved for the summer, as 
always, im getting the same views i had the last 2 months and making 50% as much daily, what a great website 
[19:31] <darksydephil> here's hoping it really picks up once new releases hit in august and September 
[19:32] <darksydephil> Twitch, however, remains good as none of that stuff matters here lol 
[19:32] <darksydephil> yeah 

[19:32] <darksydephil> theres nothing to stop Atlus from making the same mistake all over again 
[19:33] <darksydephil> since there was no logical reason for them to do it the first time 
[19:36] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up in a sec 

[19:38] <darksydephil> youtube would need an actual human to implement a change like that, but its all run by 

algorithms and hots now 

[19:38] <darksydephil> SanguineNite 

[19:38] <darksydephil> youtube lost around 50% of their advertiser base 

[19:39] <darksydephil> most of their remaining advertisers are US based 

[19:39] <darksydephil> they used to have WAY more international ads but they all got pulled 

[19:40] <darksydephil> it just started like 2 minutes ago so 

[19:42] <darksydephil> youtube gaming doesn’t even exist lol 

[19:42] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet that we’re live and we’ll get staretd

[12:21] <darksydephil> hello everyone! 

[12:25] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 

[12:27] <darksydephil> people still play SFV because they’re mindless sheep, they have to buy into what's 
popular and Capcom needs to push it because they literally have nothing else to sell right now in the realm of 
fighters, so the peripheral companies, streamers and everyone will keep pushing the golden turd to keep Capcom 
fighters alive despite it being the worst one in competitive history, it's a pathetic situation 
[12:28] <darksydephil> yup i heard about TOkido winning 
[12:29] <darksydephil> it seems like i took the perfect time off 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i missed multiple days of twitch being messed up, whether it was intentional or not lol 
[12:30] <darksydephil> theres my opinion 

[12:32] <darksydephil> Kinggoken its just becuase its the last vid i uploaded on Saturday and nothing since then, 
thats all 

[12:32] <darksydephil> the mongoloids all pile their toxic shit on whatever video is the last i upload 

[12:34] <darksydephil> good to hear that EVO still has no idea how to properly schedule time for their finals all 

this time later lol. things never change 

[12:34] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live, then grab some drinks 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170717-02 ULTRA SF2 SWITCH 8TH.LOG

[19:31] <darksydephil> okay stream will be starting shortly 

[19:34] <darksydephil> info updated 

[21:24] <darksydephil> because he’s a piece of shit 

[21:24] <darksydephil> pretty simple concept lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170718-01 DARK SOULS 2 SCHOLAR 11TH.LOG 

[12:25] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:26] <darksydephil> i just updated the stream info, did it work? 

[12:27] <darksydephil> okay good 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so the destiny 2 beta is a huge flop on ps4 lol 

[12:27] <darksydephil> entire thing doesn't work, everyone just gets the same error code 

[12:28] <darksydephil> for 2 hours running now 

[12:28] <darksydephil> now i have to wonder about tomorrow on xbox one for me 

[12:28] <darksydephil> oh it finally started working TaurusOxford ? how long did it take? twitter has over 52k 
tweets about it not working lol 

[12:29] <darksydephil> well good, that makes me feel better about tomorrow then 

[12:30] <darksydephil> danielsvenson2 : you don't pay much attention, do you? I'm playing on Xbox One and 
that doesn't launch until tomorrow 

[12:30] <darksydephil> because the viewer provided an xbox one code? 

[12:32] <darksydephil> just be happy i didnt say i wanted to rip your head off and slam dunk it like a basketball. 









apparently my SJW stalkers got triggered last night lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> luckily Twitch doesn't take them seriously, these assholes mass report me daily for every 
little thing hoping they'll ban me from here for no apparent reason 

[12:34] <darksydephil> KushiYakitori: last night someone was using lag tactics in USF2 and i got REALLY 
enraged, and said i’d like to rip their head off and slam dunk it like a basketball, so the SOK mass reported me on 
twitch for it LOL 

[12:35] <darksydephil> see here's the thing 

[12:35] <darksydephil> they've mass reported me so much and "cried wolf that they've completely lost any 
power to actually legitimately report me for anything 

[12:35] <darksydephil> twitch doesn't care because they know these kids do it daily 
[12:35] <darksydephil> and its always bullshit 
[12:36] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> so their channel got shut down, is back up, i had nothing to do with it, but they're taking 
it out on me? that's some high level intellect there 
[12:39] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:41] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks 
[12:41] <darksydephil> then we'll get started 
[12:46] <darksydephil> um in 6 feet tall 

[12:46] <darksydephil> did that guy really make a height joke about me??? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:47] <darksydephil> damn i think i need to power down my ps4 

[12:47] <darksydephil> its giving me that error wher eit thinks im trying to eject a disc 

[17:35] <darksydephil> JessicaParker , instead of talking out of your ass, why don’t you actually ask a twitch 

mod about what is and isn't allowed on streams 

[17:35] <darksydephil> because i did. and what i do IS allowed. 

[17:36] <darksydephil> or else i’d have been banned a LONG time ago' 

[17:36] <darksydephil> um, ive talked to a REAL twitch mod via their email system 

[17:37] <darksydephil> what isn't allowed is specifically asking for people to give bits for a certain reason, so 

like saying "i need to buy a game, please send me $60 in bits today" etc 

[17:37] <darksydephil> or demanding people pay you bits in order to stream etc 

[17:37] <darksydephil> you can mention bits, they exist, it's not supposed to be kept a huge secret 

[17:38] <darksydephil> and in fact, when it comes to tips, you can do whatever you want, tips are outside of the 

bit system and you can literally say or do whatever in regards to them 

[17:38] <darksydephil> twitch has no say over what you do with tips since its not part of their business model 
[17:39] <darksydephil> Jessica Parker are you retarded or something? i just laid out factual discussion from a 
real conversation with twitch mods and your response is "kettle meet pot." No, really, are you slow? 

[17:39] <darksydephil> Skooma: asking for tips is actually fine. I've confirmed it. I have it in writing lol. but I 
wouldn't specifically ask for tips anyway in the manner that's not allowed for bits 

[17:40] <darksydephil> simply saying you can support a stream by cheering with bits, subbing or tipping and 
that it helps stuff out is 100% allowed and always has been, or else how the fuck would viewers even know that 
they exist? 

[17:40] <darksydephil> these dumb fuck kids are just that: dumb as fuck, they don't understand that the world 
isn't black and white and that things are subjective, im not on here constantly begging nonstop for money, that's 
what twitch doesn’t want: people holding viewers over the fire to pay them for stuff 

[17:42] <darksydephil> doritoslayerz : what that means is, you can't use bits as e-currency for transactions, you 
can’t ask someone for $60 in bits and then send them a game, for example. 

[17:42] <darksydephil> if someone is just sending you bits as a donation/tip, then it's 100% allowed and yes, you 
can even call it your business, but you can't PURCHASE things legally with bits 

[17:43] <darksydephil> the problem is, kids aren't smart enough to read legalese and understand what it means 
because none of them have an IQ high enough 

[17:43] <darksydephil> and yes, i’m well aware that a lot of people who constantly false report me are adults, but 



they have pea brains of children lol 

[17:44] <darksydephil> anyway im off to eat dinner 

[17:44] <darksydephil> enough of that dumbass

[12:30] <darksydephil> a good start, yesterday sucked, nobody really cared about Destiny 2 and it ended up 
being incredibly underwhelming 

[12:34] <darksydephil> what do you mean? all the YouTube and Twitch hype hounds are saying Destiny 2 is 
great! Looking forward to the tens of thousands of dollars they'll be pulling in from idiots who watch them play 
the crappiest most generic game lol 

[12:35] <darksydephil> tulliuscicero25 like i just said, idiots, there's no short supply of them 
[12:35] <darksydephil> they'll sit there watching generic garbage but hate on genuinely interesting stuff 
[12:35] <darksydephil> they're like fucking cows chewing their cud lol 
[12:36] <darksydephil> tulliuscicero25 : pretty much anything but destiny 2 

[12:37] <darksydephil> like i said in my final video, i refuse to give Bungie money for that phoned in crap, ill 
only play Destiny 2 if someone donates it 

[12:37] <darksydephil> talk about a fucking game studio that puts in zero effort and makes tons of money off it, 
what a joke, no talent fucks when theres TONS of other studios out there with massive talent busting their ass 
and struggling to make it

[12:25] <darksydephil> they don't even make BMWs that color 

[12:25] <darksydephil> if you know about cars, its actually pretty easy to figure out which one i have be only 
two models of car come in that particular shade of blue 
[12:26] <darksydephil> and its a pretty cheap car 

[12:26] <darksydephil> but yeah, sounds like the usual stupidity, yes, i bought TWO cars despite being almost 
broke, okay then lol

[12:27] <darksydephil> you can’t help people from being gullible sheep, just like last night, on twitter after I said 
Danganronpa 2 is worse than 1 and way too drawn out, idiots starting rumors that im dropping it despite it being 
on my damn schedule that's publicly listed for tonight's stream 
[12:28] <darksydephil> the first half of the trial was great 
[12:28] <darksydephil> the second half was convoluted bullshit 

[12:28] <darksydephil> as in, WAY too drawn out, way too much dialogue, it actually drained me to even finish 
it 

[12:28] <darksydephil> and thats only the second trial of 6 

[12:30] <darksydephil> you are a sub, why are you usinjg a generic emote instead of the real one? lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> Toguro3 : no patrons have withdrawn their pledges, that's just the same idiots talking shit 

on twitter who don't pledge 

[12:33] <darksydephil> pop goes the moron 

[12:34] <darksydephil> why? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> its fun to kick him in the balls after he's gone 
[12:34] <darksydephil> ok stream working for everyone? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> do you really think i care what the detractors do? they twist everything into something 
negative, im not going to pussyfoot around my entire life for fear they'll say or do something because they're

[12:35] <darksydephil> the soundtrack, omg 

[12:36] <darksydephil> no, i only played like 2 hours of adventure 2 be it was a pirated copy that was corrupted 
and the entire game glitched out. i couldn’t stop clipping through the egg destroyer mothership lol 
[12:36] <darksydephil> well 
[12:36] <darksydephil> whatever the ship was 

[12:36] <darksydephil> i distincly remember playing at the bat and just clipping through entire levels

[13:29] <darksydephil> hey folks 

[13:29] <darksydephil> stream starting in just a sec 

[13:33] <darksydephil> angelus, we dont have either of those flavors here lol 
[13:33] <darksydephil> so i can't help you 

[13:33] <darksydephil> heres its blackberry/raspberry, grape/something, orange/pineapple and kiwi/mango 
[13:34] <darksydephil> GreatestStoryNeverTold : they're not, at least in the case of Destiny 2, tons of big 
streamers were paid to play it all weekend, it got leaked 

[13:35] <darksydephil> GreatestStoryNeverTold it's all over twitter, people up in arms that all of twitch is 
Destiny 2 and then people revealing its be they got paid lol 

[13:35] <darksydephil> and as for Splatoon 2, its not surprising considering its the only new game for the Switch 
in months. 

[13:35] <darksydephil> so of course people will play/cover it 
[13:37] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[13:37] <darksydephil> there is no sound, xbox one dashboard has none 
[13:38] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 
[13:40] <darksydephil> purging the chat of morons before we start 
[13:40] <darksydephil> good think they spoke up early 

[13:41] <darksydephil> yeah, remember when DLCs meant a substantial amount of new content to a game that 
wasn't already in the base game? lol 

[13:41] <darksydephil> it seems Undead Nightmare was one of the last times DLCs were substantial, with the 
exception being From Software games

[12:32] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:32] <darksydephil> so inexplicably i need to unplug and replug in my hdmi cord every single time i boot my 
xbox one 

[12:32] <darksydephil> or else i dont get any video out 

[12:32] <darksydephil> i have no idea why this is or how to fix it but its done that since launch lol 
[12:33] <darksydephil> ok stream starting in a sec 

[12:34] <darksydephil> hope you guys have checked out the new merch, i already ordered 2 shirts its so good 
[12:37] <darksydephil> stream working?

[12:42] <darksydephil> im running around watering the bamboo plants lol 

[12:42] <darksydephil> gonna talk in a sec 

[12:44] <darksydephil> im debating getting hamsters again be theyr'e so easy to take care of 
[12:44] <darksydephil> but i dunno 

[12:46] <darksydephil> i actually WANT fish but dont you have to clean out hte tank completely periodically? 
which would be a nightmare to do alone esp. with my back, dont want to reinjure it 





[12:46] <darksydephil> but i could be totally wrong, maybe there are pumps etc now that do it for you 
[12:47] <darksydephil> see fuck that, i couldn't lift an insanely heavy tank by myself etc its too risky 
[12:49] <darksydephil> yeah see, id want a nice ta nk with a variety of fish taht can live together 
[12:49] <darksydephil> i already know what i want, some of those dope cleaner shrimp and stuff

[17:17] <darksydephil> you're banned 
[17:17] <darksydephil> next page 
[17:18] <darksydephil> enough of htese retards 

[17:18] <darksydephil> the fact is if they're coming here to discuss this they have no reason to use stream chat, 
because its not for that discussion 

[17:18] <darksydephil> let them talk about it on their own fucking social media 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170724-02 DANGANRONPA 2 9TH.LOG

[22:09] <darksydephil> thanks, it was a good session 

[22:09] <darksydephil> i like when the murders are developing and you're investigating be it leads to a lot of 
detective work

ago 

[12:23] <darksydephil> yeah the follows have been pretty crazy this last month 

[12:23] <darksydephil> i just hope these people actually show up for new releases and arent all bots lol 
[12:25] <darksydephil> 40k viewers would never happen 

[12:25] <darksydephil> but a few thousand for big new releases? ive done it before 
[12:25] <darksydephil> and now that im doing cheers/subs/tips i imagine that would blow up 
[12:25] <darksydephil> so depending on how far i get today, it'll determine tomorrows stream 
[12:26] <darksydephil> i dunno if ill finish up undead nightmare or not 
[12:26] <darksydephil> so ill probably put tomorrow to a vote then 
[12:27] <darksydephil> either a 2nd Nier run, or Crash 1, or USF2 
[12:29] <darksydephil> i played crash 1 2 years ago fyi 
[12:29] <darksydephil> and crash 2 last year

<darksydephil> is it in the psn store or through the game? 

<darksydephil> okay i should grab it beforehand then 
<darksydephil> im not 100% this game lol 
<darksydephil> fuck all that shit, its hard enough 
<darksydephil> um 

<darksydephil> the stormy ascent levle says "purchased" and doesn't let me download it 
<darksydephil> but i never downloaded or installed it myself 
<darksydephil> so i dunno 

<darksydephil> the code is: 323GD-JQETN-FTHD3 
<darksydephil> notices what? 

<darksydephil> my mic is off 
<darksydephil> all you're hearing is the game 

- #DARKSYDEPHIL 20170726-02 DANGANRONPA 2 11TH.LOG 
[19:29] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:29] <darksydephil> sup all, setting up now 
[19:30] <darksydephil> oh come on 

[19:31] <darksydephil> haven't you ever watched a 7 hour podcast that ends up being 100% full of 
misinformation and bullshit? i mean, that's a great use of time 

[19:31] <darksydephil> its not like lives or jobs should get in the way of 7 straight hours of lies and nonsense, 
that's time that's meant to be wasted 
[19:31] <darksydephil> oh 

[19:32] <darksydephil> im referring to a 7 hour podcast that my detractors did a few months back in response to 
my leaving machinima and testing the waters with a new partnership company, they had "guests" on claiming to 
work for said company etc. when in the end, I never even WORKED with that company. It was 7 completely 
wasted hours lol 

[19:32] <darksydephil> of course they'd never admit that, they still to this day spin crazy conspiracy theories that 
i worked with that company so they dont look like complete fucking morons 

[19:34] <darksydephil> im sure there are probably tons of conspiracies right now about stuff like, what i did 
during my time off etc lol 

[19:35] <darksydephil> i was the second gunman on the grassy knoll, true story. 

[19:37] <darksydephil> im obviously to blame for the transgender ban on the US military, i mean come on 
[19:39] <darksydephil> no, the truth is, the ban was done be there is a spending bill being massively help up over 
the fact that allowing the transgendered soldiers into the military, as Obama signed into law, would provide for 
sex change operations and therapies, and lawmakers did NOT want to approve that stipulation, so Trump finally 


[12:31] 

[12:32] 

[12:33] 

[12:35] 

[12:35] 

[12:40]

[12:45] 

[12:45] 

[13:28] 

[16:56] 

[16:56] 

[16:56] 





just said fuck it and banned them all so that there wouldn't be a need for those sex change costs etc. So now, his 
spending bill can get approved and he can get his border wall 

[19:39] <darksydephil> that's 100% true by the way, its confirmed, the transgender ban has nothing to do with 
bias against transgendered people 

[19:40] <darksydephil> basically the US government is a fucking convoluted, evil system, i have no fucking idea 
how we even allow it 

[19:40] <darksydephil> people are just so complacent, they wont do anything about broken Washington DC is 
[19:41] <darksydephil> anyway, is the stream working? lol 

[19:41] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live, i’ll leave the political discussion over now be im so sick of the 
damn system we have, i dont even want to think abou tit 

[19:41] <darksydephil> Floofiez : well, i am a complete jerk, but sometimes i know what im talking about 
[19:44] <darksydephil> ok all, i appreciate you joining in the convo but lets kill the political talk now

[12:39] <darksydephil> im downloading the patch right now, since you know, it didn't auto download like its 

supposed to 

[12:39] <darksydephil> same Popsicolo 
[12:39] <darksydephil> seems like a shitty launch 
[12:41] <darksydephil> yes i did derich 
[12:41] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ive heard Doomfist sucks ass lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> but i dunno how people can determine that so early 

[12:45] <darksydephil> isn’t he 100% punches? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> they nerfed roadhog? wow 
[12:46] <darksydephil> last time i played he was godlike 
[12:46] <darksydephil> wow thats a HUGE change then 

[12:47] <darksydephil> remember last time i played, he was hooking me THROUGH shit for easy instant kills 
[12:48] <darksydephil> winston is good? he get buffed or everyone else just got nerfed? 

[12:49] <darksydephil> this patch is still downloading lol

[12:51] <darksydephil> okay it finally finished "preparing to download" and is now downloading very fast 

[12:51] <darksydephil> like 20+ mbps 

[12:51] <darksydephil> megabytes per second i mean 

[12:53] <darksydephil> what on earth is a non sequitar ending? the original IT had a very definitive ending 
[12:53] <darksydephil> yeah they split up IT into two movies, they're banking on the fact the first does well so 
they can make the sequel

[19:30] <darksydephil> almost ready to go live 
[19:31] <darksydephil> not really lol 

[19:31] <darksydephil> tried a new kind of frozen dinner that took 45 minutes to cook and wasn't very good 

[19:31] <darksydephil> im glad i dont eat them often 

[19:32] <darksydephil> all frozen dinners take that long in the oven 

[19:32] <darksydephil> but if you make them in the microwave they're awful, often turn out dry as hell and 





flavorless 

[19:34] <darksydephil> LOL if you microwaved kid cuisine it turned out like rubber 
[19:36] <darksydephil> there was an update patch for USF2 
[19:36] <darksydephil> wonder what it changed 
[21:57] <darksydephil> im not mad at werktwerk 

[21:58] <darksydephil> i just think what he said was incredibly stupid and/or a bad joke, everyone knows that 
LTG and i are two completely different people who have no relation, we dont even do the same things, why 
would we road trip to evo? its fucking stupid 

[21:58] <darksydephil> now if im playing on stream im going to give him a thank you for the bits but i dont have 
to address that message be it's just going to derail the stream chat more and honestly, i dont care about that 
subject 

[21:58] <darksydephil> i didnt think it was offensive btw no worries 
[21:59] <darksydephil> not like i got angry or banned you lol 

[21:59] <darksydephil> and yeah, it’d be popular with morons who just want to see drama and stupidity, both of 
which i try to avoid 

[22:01] <darksydephil> did she? wow nice 

[22:01] <darksydephil> hope you like it, i use my mug every day 

[22:03] <darksydephil> sonic, ive played street tighter since the day part 2 was released in US arcades in 1991.

[19:27] <darksydephil> live shortly 

[19:29] <darksydephil> if they are directly rebroadcasting my stuf fon twitch, yes, its illegal 
[19:29] <darksydephil> and twitch will shut it down if reported 

[19:29] <darksydephil> if it's on youtube, theres nothing i can do as i cant afford a lawsuit to get a video actually 
taken down 

[19:30] <darksydephil> well i dont pay attention to what they do 

[19:30] <darksydephil> im here to play games and have fun 

[19:34] <darksydephil> none of you have any idea what you’re talking about haha 

[19:35] <darksydephil> when you get reported for anything, first you get a warning and/or a first offense 

suspension, not an outright channel deletion, even if SOK was found guilty, they'd be back in a day or two 

anyway 

[19:35] <darksydephil> twitch is VERY lenient with what they allow if someone isn’t known to be a repeat 
offender

school days. I didn’t know her love was a student, in fact that's a huge spoiler because everyone's been SO 
DESPERATE to explain to me how i was wrong for days, they didn’t THINK that explaining that much revealed 
a spoiler, sigh

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170730-01 DANGANRONPA 2 13TH.LOG 

[12:32] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:35] <darksydephil> it's a plothole per my line of reasoning that Mikan’s "love" was someone she knew 






before school, but since SO MANY people have rushed to tell me it's not a plothole and i’m wrong, you've all 
spoiled a key factor that shouldn’t have been spoiled, so yeah. 

[12:36] <darksydephil> im alright, setting up now 

[12:37] <darksydephil> lol oh boy, is this #conspiracytalk this morning? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> maybe we didn’t land on the moon. Maybe, just maybe, the moon landed on US. 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay starting up the stream 

[12:40] <darksydephil> i already have an ID chip in side me, it tracks my GPS location in relation to all nearby 
tissue boxes so i can fap at a moment's notice without having to scramble to find one 
[12:40] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab drinks as the stream starts up 
[12:44] <darksydephil> stream working everybody? 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet it out, thanks 
[12:45] <darksydephil> enjoy your time out, asshole 
[12:45] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:46] <darksydephil> as long as my voice holds out until the trial im good, be then its all voice acted 

[12:46] <darksydephil> and im assuming the investigation will be 1-2 hours so 

[12:46] <darksydephil> Emoji movie did well because Americans are braindead idiots 

[17:09] <darksydephil> ShyGuysaysHi 

[17:09] <darksydephil> im not rushing the game at all 

[17:10] <darksydephil> what im saying is, playin ga game that has needless filler and dialogue is tiring 
[17:10] <darksydephil> not evne just reading it, but playing it. its taking too damn long, its too long winded 
[17:10] <darksydephil> this happens a LOT with books by the way, and it comes through with this game because 
its a "visual novel" 

[17:10] <darksydephil> the writers didn’t do a good job of keeping the game moving, instead drew stuff out way 
too long. 

[17:11] <darksydephil> let me give you an example: game of thrones which is actually called a Song of Ice and 
Fire 

[17:11] <darksydephil> in the first 3-4 books George RR Martin does a great job 

[17:11] <darksydephil> but then in the 5th book he completely loses his way. Takes entire chapters to explain 
nothing, just filler 

[17:11] <darksydephil> the entire thing just falls apart 

[17:11] <darksydephil> and i stopped reading hte books because of that 

[17:12] <darksydephil> its the same with Danganronpa 2, there are great moments and then sadly you get stuff 
like today when we could have been done with this entire thing in 2 hours, not 4+ 

[17:12] <darksydephil> keep in mind theres like, 2 more hours to this trial, this was just the halfway point! lol 
[17:12] <darksydephil> it massively overstays its welcome 

[17:12] <darksydephil> thats the challenge of good writing, keeping your audience engaged, today totally 
disengaged me with that fucking puzzle room and the superfluous dialogue 
[17:13] <darksydephil> the same happened during the second trial 

[17:13] <darksydephil> does this mean the game is bad? not by any means, it just means they needed to do better 
writing 

[17:13] <darksydephil> flaws like this become HUGELY apparent in a game where you rmain focus i sthe story 
and writing, if this game had a ton of gameplay it would mask the flaws in the writing far better 
[17:14] <darksydephil> people expressed that they didn't want webcame etc during visual novel style games 
[17:15] <darksydephil> i dont use one for walking dead or other telltale games either 

[17:16] <darksydephil> yeah, im not saying i dont like Danganronpa 2, i do. trying to figure out the murders etc 
is crazy fun. But you can understand why i cant keep playing this kind of game. I mean i've dedicated like 10-12 
hours this week ALONE to just this game and only beat 1.5 chapters! what the fuck 

[17:17] <darksydephil> people are telilng me this game is 30 hours long, it is NOT thirty hours long, its more 
like 50-60 

[17:17] <darksydephil> each chapter is taking anywhere from 5-7 hours to complete at a minimum. Chapter 4 
we’d already played for an hour, then today was 4 hours, and the conclusion will probably be 2 hours more 
[17:18] <darksydephil> it pads it somewhat but not massively, remember the trials are fully voice acted 



[17:18] <darksydephil> so you can’t really speed by those parts unless you actually skip the voice acting lol 

[17:20] <darksydephil> yeah i get that, theres no way this game is 30 hours long if you're actually playing it, 

doing free time, and paying attention, it's insanely long for any game's standards which is why i know this 

summer wasn't the tiem for it after just playing the first game, i mean we’re literally getting half the amount of 

people watching thi splaythrough, most likely be i JUST finished part 1 

[17:20] <darksydephil> $125 short, but keep in mind, people also get declined pledges too 

[17:20] <darksydephil> only way we’re hitting it is if people step up and do big pledges just for that reason, no 

way we’re getting 25 people to pledge $5 this close to the end of the month 

[17:21] <darksydephil> yup i still have the jak collection 

[17:22] <darksydephil> also people really dont seem to understand the power that the patrons choice gives you 
[17:22] <darksydephil> in this one for the sonic game? only 30 people voted 

[17:22] <darksydephil> i have over 80 people eligible to vote but more than half don’t, just like the US 
government LOL 

[17:22] <darksydephil> so just think about that 

[17:23] <darksydephil> $5 and you could concretely mold a full playthrough i’d be doing over a close period of 

time, thats crazy amount of power 

[17:23] <darksydephil> people don't see it as that though 

[17:24] <darksydephil> okay guys im out, gotta upload and get working on dinner, see you tomorrow for the 
indies marathon! 

[17:27] <darksydephil> Patreon isn’t kickstarter. Why don’t people understand that lol 
[17:27] <darksydephil> "someone who actually does something" 

[17:28] <darksydephil> i put out hours upon hours of stream and video footage a day, FOR FREE. I do tons, i 
just don't put it onto a painted canvas. You're a moron 

[17:28] <darksydephil> you know, because it was totally easy to spend 9 years of my life building up this 
internet following and making tons of sacrifices along the way to make it work. I do nothing! lol 
[17:30] <darksydephil> that wasn't even a troll though, that was a genuine idiot, it takes work to be that ignorant 
[17:31] <darksydephil> um 

[17:31] <darksydephil> im uploading videos right now.... 

[17:31] <darksydephil> are you seriously complaining? 

[17:31] <darksydephil> "i was joking" 

[17:31] <darksydephil> LOL 
[17:31] <darksydephil> great rollback there haha 
[17:31] <darksydephil> thanks ThatAnonyMouse 
[17:32] <darksydephil> see you tomorrow hopefully 

[17:33] <darksydephil> it would depend upon when im playing them but more than likely the ps3 version 
considering i already have it. less money spent is the best option right now 

[17:41] <darksydephil> Joe is someone who got popular doing an incredibly difficult, complicated style of video 
(dress-up cosplay skits and the like) and now he wants to do easy, fun stuff instead. And his viewerbase don’t 
want him to do that because that's not what he’s known for. It's a pretty simple situation and he's basically fucked 
[17:41] <darksydephil> at least in my case I made sure to ENJOY the stuff I got popular for lol. I really like 
playing games and sharing daily with you guys 

[17:42] <darksydephil> both AVGN and Nostalgia critic also got into the same exact situation and both are now 
forced to keep doing the videos they dont like making for a living be nobody else watches the other shit 
[17:43] <darksydephil> seriously. Watch the early AVGN vids from his first 4 years, watch ANYTHING he 
does now. holy fuck it's different 

[17:43] <darksydephil> SirJamesDTechl : he tried to cash in on youtube fads and the like and do the easy shit 
that tons of other worthless, drama-queen morons were making a living doing. Only it insults his original fanbase 
[17:44] <darksydephil> imagine if i suddenly announced im only going to do l/3rd as much gaming videos, but 
instead i’ll be doing PHIL REACTS like everyone else as a major series 
[17:44] <darksydephil> i dont think it would fly so well lol 

[17:45] <darksydephil> when i started this thing on YT i made sure it was doing something i wouldn't end up 
hating, playing fun new and even retro games is just FUN to me. yeah there are frustrating parts about it but 



there's such a wide variety of games to play, i never run out of content 

[17:45] <darksydephil> Joe is fucked because he's pidgeonholed himself into a situation where he wants to do 
easier stuff but peopel ONLY want to see him down the complicated vids he's known for. People will go 
elsewhere to see people just play games, sadly, because others have done that for ages 
[17:46] <darksydephil> i wouldn’t know, but when he’s doing videos showing off "my free trip to Italy for 
Wticher 3" or "my new alienware PC" that he obviously got for free, i’d start questioning the validity of anything 
he does, i mean holy shit, imagine if i put out videos like that lol 

[17:49] <darksydephil> YouTube revenue will always be half of what it was IMO. You NEED either millions 
upon millions of views on every big video you release OR a great Twitch following to survive now 
[17:50] <darksydephil> Luckily i have a combo that's at least working for now 

[17:54] <darksydephil> yeah i dunno anything about him on that level, as i don't watch his stuff, so no idea if he 
overspent or anything like that, if he's in my situation, he's fucked lol 

[17:55] <darksydephil> It could just be that Joe is now used to a certain lifestyle of massive travel and industry 
attentions nd being that he's now making half as much money, he can't maintain it anymore. And he's upset be 
that was the part of his job he actually liked, while making the reviews etc. he hated over time be of the 
incredible amount of work that went into them 

[17:56] <darksydephil> i mean Joe travels a ton for cons and events, and a lot of that is out of his pocket. He's 
not making tons of dough attention a convention or covering some gaming press event. His money comes from 
his videos 

[17:57] <darksydephil> i haven't had real in-person social interaction on a regular basis since like, 2007. before 

youtube started, once i started with youtube that all went away, thats part of the sacrifices i keep bringing up to 

make this work, i cant have regular friends with the amoutn of time i put into this job 

[17:57] <darksydephil> before that it was mostly cowworkers or my Street Fighter buddies 

[17:58] <darksydephil> SirJamesDTechl i can personally attest to that 

[17:58] <darksydephil> when i lived in CT i had tons of money 

[17:58] <darksydephil> as soon as i moved out here, poof, gone 

[17:59] <darksydephil> and yeah i have a nice house but outside of that all the fun stuff i used to do, i couldn’t 
afford, no more crazy fun vacations or attending cons, no more frivolous spending whenever i wanted, i mean 
shit, i can't even buy stuff for the business whenever i want anymore 

[17:59] <darksydephil> i live 1 hour from PAX West and never attended it. always had to stay home working 
[18:00] <darksydephil> moving back is impossible, it cost me over $7k to move here. I don't ahve anywehre to 
even put this stuff, it would take months to sell it all off. it would be a nightmare essentially to move back to 
Connecticut, and would destroy the business as it’d take far too mcuh time away from being able to work 
[18:01] <darksydephil> plus that would just go right back to insanely high taxes etc 
[18:01] <darksydephil> i can't even get an apartment now, my credit is awful, wuldn’t pass that check lol 
[18:01] <darksydephil> i need to make this keep working for at least a couple more years until i can pay down 
some debt 

[18:02] <darksydephil> i can't drive cross country! LOL 

[18:03] <darksydephil> i haven't driven on a highway in nearly lOyears 

[18:03] <darksydephil> my back injury 

[18:04] <darksydephil> um my folks are old, and both of them also have bad backs 

[18:04] <darksydephil> it's not gonna happen, people think that everything is magically cheap or doable because 
they still think im 20 years old lol 

[18:06] <darksydephil> i need to do one of two things, both of which involve me making YT and twitch work for 
a while 

[18:06] <darksydephil> the first ideal situation would be wait a couple of years, pay down my debt, wait for my 
credit score to improve and then refinance this house, wrap all the awful CC debt etc into it at a low rate. That 
would save my credit and me 

[18:07] <darksydephil> worse case scenario, wait 1-2 years to pay down my debt and sell the house, using the 
money to pay off a lot of the existing debt, and then since my credit score will have improved, get a good 
apartment or condo out here that's way cheaper but still suits my needs 

[18:08] <darksydephil> but there's the likely 3rd scenario: shit doesn’t work out with YT/twitch due to stuff 



outside my control, i’m forced to sell this house FAST, sell the shit inside FAST, move back to CT. i honestly 
dont even know if that would work be it would harm the business so badly and i may not even be able to keep up 
with the shit back there, may lose the condo in CT and then what? 

[18:08] <darksydephil> thats not how life works 
[18:09] <darksydephil> only kids say that shit lol 

[18:09] <darksydephil> how do i magically formulate a plan b now? you can't 
[18:09] <darksydephil> exactly 

[18:09] <darksydephil> there was no way for me to tell in 2008 how things would go in 2010, or in 2012, or 
2014, 2015 or now 

[18:12] <darksydephil> no, i dont think staying on twitch would have helped anything be i wasn't streaming in 
the "twitch manner" until March of this year

[12:32] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:33] <darksydephil> looks like we got some fanart overnight 

[12:38] <darksydephil> rage arts ARE lame, blatantly lifted super moves from every other fighting game be 
Namco had no idea what else to add to the franchise for 7, so just copied everyone else 

[12:38] <darksydephil> tekken always relied on being unique, but in the case of rage arts they just copy/pasted 
[12:39] <darksydephil> ive played tekken since the early 1990s, now 25 years later im supposed to remember 
they added in super moves from other franchises, my mind is already hard wired otherwise lol 
[12:44] <darksydephil> "i like kekon better" but you’re here on my channel instead of his, logic! lol 
[12:45] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> ok great ill tweet it out 

[12:46] <darksydephil> first game we’ll talk about right now on prestream 

[15:41] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[15:41] <darksydephil> when did it go out? 

[15:42] <darksydephil> i have to restart the stream 

[15:42] <darksydephil> its a random windows driver isssue that happens from time to time 
[15:42] <darksydephil> nothing i can do about it 
[15:42] <darksydephil> brb
