[11:51] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:51] <darksydephil> Happy New Year all 
[11:52] <darksydephil> thanks, got it! 

[11:53] <darksydephil> well I was going to try and get Patrons their perks as early as possible this month, but we 
had over 20 people declined and over $100 that didnt go through so... 

[11:53] <darksydephil> sadly theres no way to see when stuff DOES process after it gets declined, theres no 
notification or whateve.r so now i have to wait 
[11:54] <darksydephil> which one is shelgon? 

[11:54] <darksydephil> oh gotcha 

[11:54] <darksydephil> yeah hopefully its worth it 

[11:55] <darksydephil> apparently i really lucked out catching him as he was only available in the patch of grass 

where i got him lol. had no idea he was rare 

[11:55] <darksydephil> nice 

[11:56] <darksydephil> hmm lol 

[11:56] <darksydephil> im on a new island now 

[11:57] <darksydephil> I currently have 145 total subs, pretty sweet! 

[11:57] <darksydephil> thats pretty good for nothing really going on with gaming right now. i imagine it'll be 
some good growth once 2017's new releases hit 
[11:57] <darksydephil> really? nice! 

[11:58] <darksydephil> yeah honestly it seems these specific crates (wwe, marvel etc) are far better than the 
regular monthly ones 

[11:58] <darksydephil> you get better stuff and a lot more value 

[11:58] <darksydephil> a lot of those general ones are just junk lol 

[12:04] <darksydephil> earthquake doesn't work on floating pokemon right? 

[12:04] <darksydephil> so the bird should avoid it 

[12:05] <darksydephil> yup we got to Top Pot every one in a while, great donuts 

[12:05] <darksydephil> i dont even remember much about dark souls I sine ei cheated my way through it lol 
[12:06] <darksydephil> dunkin donuts does not exist here, because we have Starbucks and they dominate the 
area along with local stuff 

[12:06] <darksydephil> yup we've seen the original Starbucks tons of times 
[12:08] <darksydephil> lol it's a new year guys, can we be nice to each other? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> just for a start, and then let it degrade from there 
[12:08] <darksydephil> but let's at least start out civilly 
[12:09] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[14:21] <darksydephil> wtf 

[14:21] <darksydephil> i accidentally hit stop stream lol 
[14:21] <darksydephil> and now OBS is frozen lolol 
[14:21] <darksydephil> hold on guys haha 
[15:03] <darksydephil> what an idiot 
[15:03] <darksydephil> anyway im back 
[15:03] <darksydephil> give me a sec 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170102-01 ZELDA OOT 3DS 3RD.LOG 

[12:06] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:06] <darksydephil> sorry im late 

[12:06] <darksydephil> was on the phone with my parents 

[12:07] <darksydephil> i dont know what to play honestly, i can't get a consistent reaction from anyone 





[12:07] <darksydephil> it's either HELL YES or HELL NO and its like 50/50 
[12:08] <darksydephil> nobody watched the first run in Dishonored lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> thecowboyboyfromhell213 : i did. there's zero consistency, i talkeda bout this in the 
week in preview last night 

[12:09] <darksydephil> the RDR hook would be: 1. direct capture 2. getting re-acquainted with the series for the 
sequel, the original play through was in 2010! 

[12:10] <darksydephil> Revolver i heard was WAY different from redemption and nobody liked it, lol 
[12:10] <darksydephil> why would i play that? 

[12:10] <darksydephil> but i never legitimately played DS1 to begin with, it wouldn’t be "playing it again," it 
would be "actually playing it this time" 

[12:11] <darksydephil> Bloodborne is never going to happen, ive explaine dit about 100 times and nobody ever 
fukcing listens for some reason 

[12:11] <darksydephil> its like talking to the wall, only hte wall might actually hear more of what im saying 

[12:12] <darksydephil> I 

[12:12] <darksydephil> CANNOT 

[12:12] <darksydephil> PLAY 

[12:12] <darksydephil> BLOODBORNE 

[12:12] <darksydephil> AGAIN 

[12:13] <darksydephil> how the fuck are people so deaf?!?! 

[12:13] <darksydephil> I don't own the game, i dont have ANY SAVE PILES. NOTHING 

[12:13] <darksydephil> holy fucking shit 

[12:13] <darksydephil> no, it didn’t save on the cloud lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> my cloud saves were full for years because of WWE 

[12:13] <darksydephil> WWE used to upload EVERYTHING, entire gigs of data, it was horribly broken 
[12:14] <darksydephil> ive said this about 400 times about bloodborne, by the way. so no idea how people keep 
asking for it. its like alittle kid pulling at your leg asking you to buy him a toy when you have no money 
[12:15] <darksydephil> the detractors can suck my sphincter, they will spin anything i say anyway, nobody gives 
a fuck besides the dumbfuck detractors anyway 

[12:16] <darksydephil> why would i go back and finish games nobody watched to begin with?!! lol! 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ok starting the stream now 

[12:19] <darksydephil> well some positive news, we did hit the December goal after all! Enough people updated 
their info

[19:51] <darksydephil> yup fixing it now 

[19:51] <darksydephil> thanks for actually talkign in here be you're allowing me to fix it lol 

[19:53] <darksydephil> nothing to do with nightbot going rogue 

[19:53] <darksydephil> ill explain in a bit 

[19:53] <darksydephil> cleaning it up now 

[19:53] <darksydephil> !soap 

[19:53] <darksydephil> oops forgot the link in that one 
[19:54] <darksydephil> ok adding the link now 
[19:54] <darksydephil> and all the blacklisted words are now fine 
[19:56] <darksydephil> how you doing giantenemycrap? 

[19:57] <darksydephil> peachy 

[19:57] <darksydephil> finally cleaning out the liquid shit in here 

[19:59] <darksydephil> this is the same guy who put up fanart on my forums in 2015, then false copyright struck 
me for them, completely fucking over my business, i lost probably about $50k or more and i'm out of YouTube 
search rankings because of him 



[20:01] <darksydephil> the good news is, fanart can’t be claimed anymore on YouTube because it's not fully 
automated anymore. 

[20:02] <darksydephil> yeah i wouldn’t have brought it back otherwise 
[20:06] <darksydephil> LiquidMK is Jackie Chin, same guy 

[20:06] <darksydephil> there was a second guy who also did the false copyright strikes against me as well, he 
had nothing to do with it 

[20:06] <darksydephil> but LiquidMK has basically been attacking me for 2 years straight now 
[20:09] <darksydephil> they're teh same person 
[20:09] <darksydephil> lol 

[20:11] <darksydephil> a guy pretending to be a girl, probably wishes he is one IRL 
[20:12] <darksydephil> Jackie Chin never apologized lol 
[20:15] <darksydephil> that was me FYI 
[20:20] <darksydephil> !soap 

[20:32] <darksydephil> if you guys want to add commands, i ahve to make you moderators 
[20:32] <darksydephil> so you need to create nightbot ids 

[20:32] <darksydephil> if you go to twitch.tv/nightbot and click the nightbot logo at the bottom 

[20:32] <darksydephil> it takes you to their webpage, create accounts there and then send me your IDs (privately) 

[20:33] <darksydephil> yes its the user ID 

[20:33] <darksydephil> Enter the Nightbot User ID of the user you want to add as a manager to your channel. 
This is the User ID listed in the upper right of the manager's Nightbot account settings. 

[20:34] <darksydephil> there you go 
[20:36] <darksydephil> pops you should now be good to go 
[20:36] <darksydephil> you guys will see i already set up basic stuff 
[20:36] <darksydephil> sweet thanks 

[20:36] <darksydephil> making a short vlog now to explain all of this 
[20:37] <darksydephil> ok purging chat 
[22:05] <darksydephil> fixed! 

[22:05] <darksydephil> thanks for the heads up 
[22:05] <darksydephil> !soap 
[22:59] <darksydephil> Idspgaming 
[23:00] <darksydephil> thanks, now fixed 

[23:00] <darksydephil> look at the channel info, i updated it for tomorrow 

[23:02] <darksydephil> um 

[23:02] <darksydephil> you can use up to 9 caps 

[23:02] <darksydephil> then it triggers 

[23:02] <darksydephil> thats pretty reasonable 

[23:11] <darksydephil> see 

[23:12] <darksydephil> fair enough lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170104-01 POKEMON MOON 7TH FINALE.LOG 

[11:47] <darksydephil> i join and immediately we have these shitheads talking shit? 

[11:48] <darksydephil> please do so now so i can ban your asses quickly, i have no patietnce for this today 
[11:48] <darksydephil> is the caps thing a problem? 

[11:48] <darksydephil> i have no idea if it was on before or not, could have been added by the person fing with 
nightbot 

[11:49] <darksydephil> we'll have to tweak nightbot appropriately now 

[11:49] <darksydephil> im totally open to adjustments and the like so just let me know 

[11:50] <darksydephil> the best part is that this guy spent an entire year setting this up and it got nowhere. 

completely and utterly shut down lol 

[11:50] <darksydephil> enough of that fucker 

[11:51] <darksydephil> right LemonPlaysGames but at least now its out there that this kind of shit is happening 
[11:51] <darksydephil> Raeknub hasn’t come over i dont think 




[11:53] <darksydephil> LOL triggered by it 
[11:53] <darksydephil> thats not the word at all 

[11:54] <darksydephil> this world is just a sick place now. people takin 2+ years of their time to set up insanely 
elaborate ways to hurt me. people ive never met and done nothing to 
[11:54] <darksydephil> because someone like that cannot be reasoned with 
[11:54] <darksydephil> its the mentality of a terrorist really 

[11:55] <darksydephil> somehow in his twisted mind he has a zealot like attitude that im evil and he needs to 
hurt me 

[11:55] <darksydephil> theres no other way to spin it here, 2 years of his life wasted on this and still going 
[11:55] <darksydephil> this guy has single handedly cost me tens of thousands of dollars nad fucked over my 
business with false copyright strikes, but thats not enough pain for me i guess 

[11:58] <darksydephil> parkfiction , regardless if it was the same person or not, they're all invovled in this 
together 

[11:58] <darksydephil> talking and planning it out etc 

[11:59] <darksydephil> Derichloveslemur apparently there is a TON of post game content, but i dont know what 
it is myself yet 

[11:59] <darksydephil> ok let me go set up this stream 

[11:59] <darksydephil> LOL N0 H3R0 again with the caps 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i can turn that off if its really annoying 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ok i think its off now 

[12:00] <darksydephil> give it a test but dont abuse it please 

[12:00] <darksydephil> LOL you got censored for a whole different reason 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok le tme set stuff up, give me a few minutes here 

[12:01] <darksydephil> there you go 

[12:01] <darksydephil> caps issue solved 

[12:03] <darksydephil> no new fanart today from what i can see 

[12:03] <darksydephil> just checked 

[12:03] <darksydephil> oooh just saw the views and tons of new subs on KOGaming 
[12:03] <darksydephil> this is pleasing to me. year end series off oto a great start 

[12:04] <darksydephil> ClessTheAngel im just going to say this once: i know you're IN that chat all the time and 
knew all about this, and said fucking nothing, this went far beyond "messing with commands" and you're well 
aware of it. so kindly shut the fuck up or leave 

[12:06] <darksydephil> it's pretty underhanded for you, Cless, to send me nice messages and supportive stuff, 
then be in there. That shit is toxic to my life and you're well aware 

[12:14] <darksydephil> I do like Troy Baker, it's a running joke that some people don’t get lol 

[12:15] <darksydephil> ihatestuff89 i didnt make the art, so i have no idea, but im right handed so its not a big 

deal 

[12:15] <darksydephil> anyone who pretends to be a girl and tries to catfish people already has something 

seriously wrong there, so just leave it at that 

[12:16] <darksydephil> ok stream should be going live 

[12:16] <darksydephil> theycallmejimbob not 6 months, over a year 

[12:16] <darksydephil> it started on the forums 

[12:16] <darksydephil> yes i did alldaythreeam , thanks for that 

[12:17] <darksydephil> i didnt get catfished lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> i dont get into stuff liek that with viewers, thats nothing but bad news 
[12:17] <darksydephil> ok gonna go take a decongestant, brb. nose is all messed up here 
[12:21] <darksydephil> ok just took decongestant AND nasal spray lol 
[12:21] <darksydephil> hopefully something works 
[12:24] <darksydephil> i dont even remember silverfoxlady lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> but Foez, the longtime old admin of the website, was a guy all along too 
[12:24] <darksydephil> so basically, nobody is ever really female at all 
[12:25] <darksydephil> Ginosaji48 



[12:25] <darksydephil> FYI, the detractors were going to blame everything on you. no lie lol 
[12:26] <darksydephil> that's pretty fucked up IMO but i wouldn't have believed them 

[12:26] <darksydephil> they had chat commands saying "GInosaji was behind this all along" and shit like that 
[12:27] <darksydephil> i guess they had a grudge against Gino for some reason lol 
[12:27] <darksydephil> probably for kicking them from the chat 

[12:28] <darksydephil> the best part about the whole thing was, it took a year of planning, and i could have just 
disabled it with a simple single click. I.e. turning off nightbot from the dashboard, it literally takes one second 
[12:28] <darksydephil> but they’re not that smart i guess 

[12:29] <darksydephil> well to be fair, in 100 years hwen im dead, i guess i cant do much about them defacing 
my tombstone lol 

[12:29] <darksydephil> freshjiiveTV : if you haven't noticed, nobody is listening to you because what you're 
saying is stupid, thanks 

[12:30] <darksydephil> do you seriously think they could ever have girlfriends when they spent 2 straight years 
elaborately planning shit like this? 

[12:30] <darksydephil> no woman who is sane would be with someone like that 
[14:16] <darksydephil> ok back 

[14:16] <darksydephil> looks like stream is working again? 

[14:16] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[14:16] <darksydephil> i thi nk it froze hold up 

[14:17] <darksydephil> there we go 

[14:17] <darksydephil> sometimes the capture software freezes, its random 
[14:17] <darksydephil> sound is back now right? 

[14:17] <darksydephil> ok good time to continue 

[14:21] <darksydephil> ive disabled the repetition shit for now 

[14:21] <darksydephil> its obviously not working

suspected "she" wasn't who she said she was. already unbanned a few but id keep on the lookout in case someone 
PMs us about it etc 

[12:12] <darksydephil> oh Popsicolo is her etoo, same for you sir 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i might do Yakuza 0, apparently my Yakuza 5 vids did great over time, someone jsut 
tweeted me the views and holy shit did they explode 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i guess it took a while but they did get traction over time be i remember them not doing 
well at first 

[12:16] <darksydephil> never eat pretzels without a drink nearby 

[12:16] <darksydephil> its a rule of thumb 

[12:17] <darksydephil> im playing both lordslurmp 

[12:17] <darksydephil> im never playing SFV again if i can help it 

[12:18] <darksydephil> then ill SUPER skip it! 

[12:18] <darksydephil> caps limit is off i believe 

[12:19] <darksydephil> be everyone was getting kicked yesterday for caps and repetition 
[12:19] <darksydephil> i have no real prob with caps unless someone goes full retard or something 
[12:20] <darksydephil> yup this will be an ongoing learning experience 
[12:21] <darksydephil> the army of eddys were pretty short lived 

[12:21] <darksydephil> what, a week? then disappeared, came back for a day, now gone for good 
[12:21] <darksydephil> i guess daddy's money ran out o rsomething lol

[11:49] <darksydephil> time to get set up dspCowboy 
[11:52] <darksydephil> i wont be doing the DLC 
[11:52] <darksydephil> for a simple reason 

[11:52] <darksydephil> i decided to play this on 360 this time because 1. my ps3 isn't as reliable to capture from 
and 2. ill get achievements doing this run 

[11:53] <darksydephil> it'll feel genuine to be playing the game and getting achievements for it, likea legit run 
[11:53] <darksydephil> ok setting it up now 

[11:53] <darksydephil> i only have to capture at 720p as well so the vids should look pretty good 
[11:53] <darksydephil> the DLC costs 15 bucks for xbox LOL 

[11:53] <darksydephil> the game itself is only 20, why the hell would i pay another 15 for a few more hours of 
gameplay 

[11:54] <darksydephil> soulrider i know, i already di it remember? 

[11:54] <darksydephil> in my original DS1 run i fought that dragon and shit, it ws one of the funniest moments 
when it kille dme on the ladder 

[11:54] <darksydephil> great, welcome to all newcomers 

[11:55] <darksydephil> i forgot to make the damn patreon splash screen...shit 

[11:55] <darksydephil> well no time now, maybe tonight 

[11:58] <darksydephil> you know whats weird about dark souls? 

[11:58] <darksydephil> on the xbox 360 it claims its backwards compatible on xbox one 
[11:58] <darksydephil> but on xbox one it blatantly says "can only be played on xbox 360" 

[11:58] <darksydephil> very weird 

[11:59] <darksydephil> its fine though, my 360 works well with capture 
[11:59] <darksydephil> there is no prepare to die edition digitally 




[11:59] <darksydephil> just the regular game and die separately 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i have the strategy guide buried somewhere but im not fucking getting it lol 
[12:00] <darksydephil> everything is online now 

[12:03] <darksydephil> theres nothing in teh upper right hand corner of the dark souls screen, right? 

[12:03] <darksydephil> thats where im settng up the death counter and webcam 
[12:03] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:05] <darksydephil> btw i got Lost Odyssey be its free on XBL 

[12:05] <darksydephil> im definitely playing that sometime, just not now. but i loved that game 

[12:06] <darksydephil> jack when we finished the cell saga a few months ago. we're going back to ti tsoon 

[12:07] <darksydephil> just saw your fanart pops, adding it now 

[12:10] <darksydephil> usual stream length today 

[12:11] <darksydephil> thanks Pops, jus t added it! 

[12:11] <darksydephil> thats some on the fly adjustment lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> So I'm aware that Viking and Kody Karls did cheers this morning, Viking did 10000 
right? because guess what: steamlabs says zero, lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> seriously i dunno how people use stream labs, it seems like it sucks 

[12:22] <darksydephil> console framerate is terrible everywher ein dark souls 1 lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> im ready for it 

[12:22] <darksydephil> that delay studder gameplay 

[12:22] <darksydephil> yeah steamlabs says nobody cheered, lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> I cannot play games on PC, if you want to know why, ask any of my regulars, thanks 
[12:23] <darksydephil> no DLCs this run, ill explain on prestream why 

[12:24] <darksydephil> im only going to allow invasions if they dont fuck me over and make the playthrough too 
long, if they get out of hand im unplugging the fucking console, thsi is me vs the game, not me vs an army of 
trolls 

[12:24] <darksydephil> no, im not summoning at all.im treating this like my DSII/DSIII/bloodborne runs, well 
except for DSII and mirror knight lol 

[12:25] <darksydephil> i dont even remember nameless king, who the hell is that 

[12:25] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:25] <darksydephil> OH ok, yeah 

[12:25] <darksydephil> well that was just endgame bs anyway 
[12:25] <darksydephil> i dont have time to grind offstream, so no 
[13:28] <nO_h3rO> DARKSYDEPHIL>MICHAEL JORDAN 

[16:05] <darksydephil> thanks guys, seems everyone had a fun time, see you all tomorrow

[12:11] <darksydephil> now we dont have to ever hear from him again lol 

[12:11] <darksydephil> all i needed to see was his whining, it was enough to warrant a ban 

[12:12] <darksydephil> lol i ran 2 ad breaks during my dark souls stream on friday. i made 5 bucks in ad 

revenue, what a joke twitch is for advertisements lol 





[12:14] <darksydephil> you're watching live streams and think ads rae whats taking up your bandwidth? LOL 
[12:19] <darksydephil> well at least something positive seems to have come out of this election: Hillary has 
announced she won’t ever run for office again 

[12:20] <darksydephil> all it took was for us to get a different awful president to get her to stop trying 
[12:20] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> cool, happy early birthday Derich 

[12:21] <darksydephil> SUicide Squad Joker isn’t Joker. He’s a chewed up dog turd that Joker stepped on 
[12:21] <darksydephil> ok so stream working and live for everyone?

[12:33] <darksydephil> nice, you're banned 

[12:33] <darksydephil> ive had strep throat before, yes, its awful, thank god i dont have that 
[12:34] <darksydephil> if the old witch's ring isn't a big deal then you can tell me. if something interesting is 
actually going to happen then you should just let me see it firsthand UNLESS its going to buttfuck me lol 
[12:35] <darksydephil> oh more dialogue? thats pretty neat 
[12:35] <darksydephil> do i need to be wearing it at the time? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> well shit, how am i going to knwo who to talk to lol. hmm thi swill be itneresting

[12:36] <darksydephil> oh i remember those spider women 

[12:37] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill try that out then when i finally get there, a long way to do, im already 
ocnfused as to where im supposed to go so today should be interesting lol 
[12:37] <darksydephil> ok let me piss and then we'll start 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i think if i go to the blacksmith i can actually turn on the elevator if i remember correctly 
[12:39] <darksydephil> so maybe i should do that, if i can remember how to get the fuck back there LOL 
[15:11] <darksydephil> yes, people watch me because its entertaining to watch someone whose NOT acting, and 
isn't great at aevery game, actually try to beat them, especially the tougher ones 

[15:12] <darksydephil> call it trainwreck or whatever you want but i understand why many find my stuff fun 
[15:12] <darksydephil> i never said i was good at anything besides street fighter lol 
[15:12] <darksydephil> at least when you watch me fail, you know its legit, not some fucking muppet who 
scripted the entire video for your "laughs" 

[15:14] <darksydephil> ban who? nobody is being nasty or anything that i can see 
[15:15] <darksydephil> i guess i missed it, who was that? 

[15:15] <darksydephil> spear scales with strength and dex i thought? 

[15:15] <darksydephil> fuck i hope so, i just leveled strength twice 

[15:15] <darksydephil> shit ok 

[15:15] <darksydephil> ill level dex next then 

[15:16] <darksydephil> i seriously like this spear 

[15:16] <darksydephil> way diff than using swords like i always have 

[15:16] <darksydephil> shit 

[15:16] <darksydephil> my batteries are low 

[15:16] <darksydephil> let me get mor eand then we'll resume 

[15:16] <darksydephil> brb 

[15:19] <darksydephil> minor help is ok, huge spoilers are a no no 
[16:44] <darksydephil> well this 2nd session matched the first 

[16:44] <darksydephil> and im coming up to some good stuff...pretty sure everyone wants to see the rematch of 
me vs blighttown lol 

[16:45] <darksydephil> once i pass blighttown, everything will be new be i never beat any of it legit before 

[16:45] <darksydephil> so it's gonna be a wild ride 

[16:45] <darksydephil> im liking the spear a lot more honestly 

[16:45] <darksydephil> allows me to play more defensively 

[16:46] <darksydephil> i pretty much only used swords for most of dark souls except for II, which was very 
different lol 



[16:46] <darksydephil> ive never really respeced anyway lol 
[16:48] <darksydephil> so much to do tonight 

[16:48] <darksydephil> the week in preview, messaging all patrons to get them their perks, then i have to film a 
q&a vid for a patron 

[16:48] <darksydephil> then i have to do some personal shit 

[16:48] <darksydephil> mostly be i was gonna do some of that last night but., .nope 

[16:49] <darksydephil> btw 

[16:49] <darksydephil> IMO dark souls is far better than i even thought, i mean, weapon selection is totally 
changing the gameplay style 

[16:49] <darksydephil> i had no idea you could block AND attack with a spear at the same time lol 
[16:50] <darksydephil> just updated the title pel27 
[16:50] <darksydephil> so now you know! 

[16:51] <darksydephil> sometimes i do night streams 

[16:52] <darksydephil> tonight i have too much to do, and for the next several weeks im working on edited 
series at night for my KOGaming channel] 

[16:52] <darksydephil> Ikogaming 

[16:52] <darksydephil> nighttime streams will return later this month for sure 

[16:54] <darksydephil> ok folks, off to upload the new vids. thanks for a great stream, dont miss the week in 
preview tonight and see you all tomorrow! 

[16:54] <darksydephil> im personally loving these DS streams so far, lots of funa nd people are not being 
horrendous dicks to me lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170109-01 DARK SOULS 1 3RD.LOG 

[12:00] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:00] <darksydephil> its the key to the depths, right? that you're talking about Lokizarro 
[12:01] <darksydephil> be sadly i think i got spoiled inadvertently but not sure 

[12:01] <darksydephil> last night someone sent me a vid that apparently goes to some super secret area 
[12:01] <darksydephil> ash lake or something, and during that video it showed how to get to blighttown from 
where i am, a shortcut in new londo 

[12:01] <darksydephil> but i dunno if that door opesn that direction or not 

[12:02] <darksydephil> that place looks pretty awesome though, i definitely want to go there in this run 
[12:02] <darksydephil> no idea whats actually there though besides tons of hydras lol 

[12:03] <darksydephil> if its not in new londo, then no. ill investigate the forest today and we’ll see wehre it goes. 
[12:03] <darksydephil> i just dont want to be going to a really wrong area lol 
[12:03] <darksydephil> congested 
[12:03] <darksydephil> very congested 

[12:04] <darksydephil> about to take some more drugs actually 
[12:04] <darksydephil> yes. hard coke 

[12:05] <darksydephil> stream should be starting, im going to go take some medicine, brb 
[12:09] <darksydephil> well, i hope this stew turns out well today 
[12:09] <darksydephil> an hour of prep and 6 hours of cook time lol 
[12:12] <darksydephil> stop picking on each other, thanks 
[12:12] <darksydephil> this is not #teenchat 

[12:13] <darksydephil> lol you have to prove your age in order to chat here, only 30 somethings allowed! 

[12:14] <darksydephil> there used to be a joke that you could only play Super Turbo if you were 30 years old 
[12:17] <darksydephil> its a beef stew, carrots/potatoes/garlic and a few other things, beef broth etc 
[12:18] <darksydephil> yeah its our first attempt 
[12:18] <darksydephil> so fingers crossed it's good 

[12:18] <darksydephil> no, the garlic is pre-cooked for 5 minutes along with the other veggies 

[12:18] <darksydephil> yeah N0 H3R0 we made a full cooker of it so it should be a full meal for us anothe rday 

too 

[12:19] <darksydephil> well if we wanted to make like, a tomato-based stew we could use my sauce, its not out 




of the question at all 

[12:19] <darksydephil> not sauce, that was a bit of tomato paste 

[12:20] <darksydephil> considering the halo wars 2 beta refused to even work, i dont think so 

[12:20] <darksydephil> that was such a bad advertisement for the game, it completely killed any interest i had in 

it 

[12:21] <darksydephil> only like a minute til i start 

[12:21] <darksydephil> im claering my nose out right now before i start talking 
[12:21] <darksydephil> btw is the patron goal showin? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i think i added it but i forot to pay attention lol 

[16:42] <darksydephil> chat didn't tell me where that weapon was, dingus, its a random drop 

[16:42] <darksydephil> caht told me where a door was. thats it, and it was necessary to progres 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170110-01 DARK SOULS 1 4TH.LOG

[11:58] <darksydephil> today im choking a lot though, which sucks 

[11:58] <darksydephil> im progressing through the stages of the cold 

[11:58] <darksydephil> less congestion today, less runny nose, more coughing 

[11:58] <darksydephil> so at least its progress 

[11:59] <darksydephil> bethe its about 50/50 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i knew from a video that there was something in that tree, but thats it 
[11:59] <darksydephil> i had no idea what was in the tree or that hydra etc lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i honestly though that chest was teh end of it and accidentally hit that illusory wall, 
which was pretty crazy

[12:11] <darksydephil> why would i quit? lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> Lokizarro ask me that again when im done lol

the new plan but nothing to prove it 

[12:19] <darksydephil> so, i can't go to the doctor 

[12:20] <darksydephil> um, clinics are more expensive than doctors actually 
[12:20] <darksydephil> because they’re not considered standard care

#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170113 NO STREAMS, ILL.LOG 






-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170114-01 DARK SOULS 1 7TH.LOG 

[11:58] <darksydephil> hello everyone 
[11:59] <darksydephil> eh lol 

[11:59] <darksydephil> congestion is almost gone but my throat is still bothering me 
[11:59] <darksydephil> still swollen, sore and gunky 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i only "rested" a few hours, it was our anniversary so we still had to go out for most 
ofhte day 

[12:01] <darksydephil> sooo views on my Disappointing games countdown are great. On my funniest moments 
they're like, half, wtf? 

[12:02] <darksydephil> people are seriously messed up. twice as many would like to hear me talk about bad 

games rather than laugh at funny moments 

[12:02] <darksydephil> sigh 

[12:02] <darksydephil> this world is fucked 

[12:03] <darksydephil> i can name 3 people off the top of my head who just trash talk everything for a living, 
lol. its fucking sad 

[12:05] <darksydephil> ok im going to use the restroom while the stream starts up 
[12:05] <darksydephil> brb 
[12:17] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> well yeah, my wii u is pretty useless now. shit it has been for years outside of twitlight 
princess last year 

[14:27] <darksydephil> gaylordbutthump : have you written From Software yet? to complain about the BKH? 
because its not my fault i got it as a random drop 

[14:27] <darksydephil> please address all complaints to the appropriate parties, thanks 

[14:28] <darksydephil> fuck my audience? how does getting a random weapon drop that is part of the game fuck 
my audience exactly? 

[14:29] <darksydephil> um, when was i a dick to people in the chat??? 

[14:29] <darksydephil> this is the problem, people are butthurt over phantom offenses 
[14:29] <darksydephil> im not using a guide 
[14:29] <darksydephil> at all 

[14:30] <darksydephil> "you're using something that breaks the game, according to people who like to see 
people suffer through it. but its totally legit that it's in there, and it's an incredibly low chance to get. so because 
you're lucky, you're being offensive." 

[14:30] <darksydephil> read that statement 

[14:31] <darksydephil> half the people here are whining, its pretty pathetic lol. the other half who actually are 
fans are enjoying it 

[14:32] <darksydephil> perhaps....just perhaps...if you were watching this playthrough for suffering, you were 
watching for the wrong reasons, just saying, maybe it's you, not me, that's in the wrong here, considering i'm 
using a totally legit weapon, you're really grasping at straws here 

[14:33] <darksydephil> im happy people are watching, im not happy they're sitting here whining like babies 
[14:33] <darksydephil> i mean, fuck, look at yourselves, grow up lol 

[14:33] <darksydephil> Seraphicl7 : every fact says the weapon is legit, you're talking out of your ass 

[14:34] <darksydephil> of course they are blacknyellow9 lol 

[14:34] <darksydephil> because think of it 

[14:34] <darksydephil> ive NEVER suffered with that boss, ever 

[14:34] <darksydephil> first time someone beat it for me 

[14:34] <darksydephil> second time i one shotted it 

[14:34] <darksydephil> so i'll NEVER feel the suffering 

[14:34] <darksydephil> and they're incredibly pissed about it lol 

[14:35] <darksydephil> well obviously this guy is the best dark souls player in history 

[14:35] <darksydephil> i bet he's in guiness book of world records and everything! 

[14:35] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna piss, then continuing on

[11:55] <darksydephil> so theres only 1 more covenant that gives achievements points, the gravelord covenant, i 
dunno where that one is

a weapon through this tree" 

[11:56] <darksydephil> yup im setting up right now 

[11:56] <darksydephil> as long as i haven't missed it yet, that's cool

[11:59] <darksydephil> if its not better by mid week im going to the doctor, i now can print out my proof of 

insurance, i looked it up last night

[12:00] <darksydephil> i dont think ill need 20? lol 
[12:00] <darksydephil> thats pretty excessive no 
[12:00] <darksydephil> btw 

[12:00] <darksydephil> Dr Zombius, a longtime fan, recommended a spoonful of honey mixed with cinnamon, it 
actually fucking worked 

[12:01] <darksydephil> neve rsuspected that but yeah, the soreness in my throat is greatly alleviated 
[12:01] <darksydephil> well if hot tea and lemon doesn’t work, i doubt boiled coke would

[14:24] <darksydephil> you caught me BLOWING 
[14:24] <darksydephil> OH NOOOOO

[17:20] <darksydephil> just uploaded the new sub badges 

[17:20] <darksydephil> wonder how long they'll take to go into effect 

[17:21] <darksydephil> test

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170116-01 DARK SOULS 1 9TH.LOG 

[11:49] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:50] <darksydephil> anyone here? 

[11:55] <darksydephil> hmm 

[11:55] <darksydephil> i think im going to finish the woods today, i.e. butterfly boss 

[11:56] <darksydephil> then maybe ill fight gwyndolyn 

[11:56] <darksydephil> then demon ruins, then new londo 

[11:56] <darksydephil> new londo is last, its too fucking hard 

[11:56] <darksydephil> and i just got hte DLC btw 

[11:56] <darksydephil> so ill do that just before the conclusion 

[11:57] <darksydephil> ok gonna set up the stream now 

[11:59] <darksydephil> hilarious 

[12:09] <darksydephil> yeah the badge changes appearance depending on how big you have the chat set up on 
your device 

[12:09] <darksydephil> on my desktop, its smaller, so it has the bigger glow, on my laptop i'm zoomed in and 
theres less glow 

[12:10] <darksydephil> well theres only 1 die 
[12:11] <darksydephil> what bar? 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yeah i hope they work pops 

[12:12] <darksydephil> alex i have no idea, weird, sounds like a twitch issue or like the page didn't load properly 
for you 

[12:13] <darksydephil> ok stream starting now 

[12:13] <darksydephil> thats fine, i need her soul anyway lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> i like how some idiots think that the guy who told me about the darkmoon seance ring 
last night is "spoiling." its a cryptic thing there's no possible way to figure out if you're not told, fing idiots 
[12:14] <darksydephil> yeah and i did read the description, i remember, it mentions gwynevere and thats it, 
nothing about opening an illusory wall 
[12:16] <darksydephil> ok hold on 

[12:17] <darksydephil> you could have been blocked if you were part of one of those retweeting storms from 
another YTer or something, if my twitter is getting mass spammed sometimes i have to take action 
[12:21] <darksydephil> no i'm late 
[12:21] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:21] <darksydephil> fuck that guy. he complains every day 
[12:22] <darksydephil> he can come back in 10 minutes 

[12:22] <darksydephil> if i remember, new londo is a fucking BITCH of a dungeon 
[12:23] <darksydephil> because of cheap instant deaths and fucking ghosts 
[12:23] <darksydephil> so im doing that last lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> yeah and if you run out of the transient curse items, you're completely fucked 
[12:26] <darksydephil> i actually remember manus lol 
[12:26] <darksydephil> all that dark magic bullshit 
[12:26] <darksydephil> a hundred black balls 

[12:29] <darksydephil> one sec guys, im blowing my nose, then ill start 

[13:13] <darksydephil> theres a difference between saying it lags and spamming the chat like a bunch of toddlers 
who cant get their way lol 

[13:14] <darksydephil> i restarted the stream, now its not working lol 
[13:15] <darksydephil> stream working for anyone? 

[13:15] <darksydephil> so, aren’t you guys happy you asked me to restart the steram? LOL 




[13:15] <darksydephil> its not Comcast, how could i be on the internet talking with you if it was my internet lol 

[13:16] <darksydephil> both internet lines are business class 

[13:16] <darksydephil> LOL DDOSing is totally different than this, kid 

[14:19] <darksydephil> i didnt call any of my fans morons 

[14:20] <darksydephil> i called you whiny, self entitled, toddler-esque idiots ONLY here to see me fail and then 

complain at the drop of a pin, morons 

[14:20] <darksydephil> because that's what you are lol 

[14:20] <darksydephil> please keep going 

[14:20] <darksydephil> id like to clean up the chat during break 

[14:20] <darksydephil> an you're making it easy lol 

[14:21] <darksydephil> Cless is an idiot, anyone who spends time with a group that solely hates on a single 
person is an idiot 

[14:21] <darksydephil> KingjadVCMP , um, i have no clout with twitch, sorry, if it's fed up, it's fed up and it's 
their fault 

[14:22] <darksydephil> more than likely, twitch has some big event or something going on and it's killing the 
site's bandwidth 

[14:22] <darksydephil> didn’t i only cheat during the final mission of san andreas? i honestly dont remember 
[14:23] <darksydephil> oh, a promoted esports show, thats exactly what it is thenf oiks 
[14:23] <darksydephil> that's the problem with twitch, they give all the priority to their promoted events and 
screw the little guys 

[14:23] <darksydephil> Bammbino its because of what game this is, lol 
[14:37] <darksydephil> ok back 

[14:38] <darksydephil> cless, keep it up and you'll be worse than timed out 
[17:14] <darksydephil> FYII believe the DLC issues were fixed with a patch 

[17:15] <darksydephil> be if you haven't been watching, I already freed the girl in the Hydra lake and got the 
ring for hte DLC. I just didn’t have it installed yet to actually do it 

[17:15] <darksydephil> they added that w/a patch when the realized the DLC didn’t work initially if you’d 
already started the game 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170117-01 DARK SOULS 1 10TH.LOG 

[11:48] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:50] <darksydephil> omfg a new emote 

[11:50] <darksydephil> this is gonna be good hahahah 

[11:52] <darksydephil> Popsicolo made us all a new emote 

[11:52] <darksydephil> just submitted it, lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> im sure people will join shortly, its a tad early 
[12:00] <darksydephil> i have not seen the injustice 2 trailer yet 

[12:00] <darksydephil> spent the morning getting ready throat-wise and doing behind the scenes stuff with my 
condo in CT 

[12:00] <darksydephil> thanks lergenl ! 

[12:01] <darksydephil> well it certainly did some good 

[12:01] <darksydephil> my throat is swollen/raspy today but it barely hurts, probably be it's been irritated all 
week and needs to heal 

[12:01] <darksydephil> but i woke up and my mouth WAS NOT DRY AT ALL. which is an accomplishment 
[12:02] <darksydephil> and Leanna said i barely snored 
[12:02] <darksydephil> maybe just a tad bit but it helped tons 

[12:02] <darksydephil> so i think it's gonna be a regular thing until maybe my body "trains" itself to nose breathe 
at night 

[12:02] <darksydephil> ok gonna start up the stream 
[12:02] <darksydephil> oh wait, i did lol 
[12:02] <darksydephil> i gotta refresh i think 
[12:02] <darksydephil> it didn't show up for me haha 




[12:03] <darksydephil> yeah this will be the first day in like 4 days w/o tons of throat pain 
[12:03] <darksydephil> i just can’t talk too loudly but i thi nk it'll be better overall 
[12:03] <darksydephil> damn thanks guys for the resubs! 

[12:04] <darksydephil> I submitted your new emote Pops and I called it "Sexy" 

[12:04] <darksydephil> well I have new londo 
[12:05] <darksydephil> then the die 

[12:05] <darksydephil> and then the final area, which is insanely hard but you can run through it. thats what i did 
the first time lol 

[12:05] <darksydephil> i know where the blacksmith is, but i guess i dont need the embers anyway 
[12:05] <darksydephil> id like to up my halberd but i dunno i fyou even can 
[12:10] <darksydephil> ok so we’re up and running? 

[12:11] <darksydephil> um, the Dark Souls 3 run was not a trainwreck, dummy 
[12:11] <darksydephil> at least if you're referring to mine 
[12:11] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live then 

[12:11] <darksydephil> oh ok then, i take back the dummy comment, i walked into a conversation lol 
[12:11] <darksydephil> im so used to be insulted in my own stream chat! lol 
[12:12] <darksydephil> nerv, twitch thread is the one for all fanart right now 
[12:12] <darksydephil> i didnt see your thread 
[12:12] <darksydephil> which boss was Anri? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> by the way, i think the reason my stream had iissues yesterday is twitch, im streaming at 
3.5kbps consistently, but twitch is saying there's dips below 3k which is incorrect 

[12:17] <darksydephil> did they glitch the entire game for ds3? like i heard there's a certain wall you can phase 
through and skip mor ehtan 50% of the game lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> how the hell do you speedrun the souls games? dont your weapons do zero damage if not 
leveled etc? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> including champion gundyr? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> or just hte necessary ones 

[12:22] <darksydephil> lets be honest, theres a ton of shit you can just skip in souls games lol 
[12:23] <darksydephil> huh? 

[12:23] <darksydephil> i didnt look anything up 
[12:23] <darksydephil> was there a noise 

[12:23] <darksydephil> oh, i was setting my setitngs ot private on the console 
[12:23] <darksydephil> lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170118-01 DARK SOULS 1 11TH FINALE.LOG 

[12:03] <darksydephil> hello 

[12:11] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[12:13] <darksydephil> well pops, no sign of getting the new emote approved yet 

[12:14] <darksydephil> and its incredibly dumb if they're holding it up only because i named it "sexy" 

[12:14] <darksydephil> if they reject it, i'm going to go apeshit on them 
[12:15] <darksydephil> np fireja 

[12:16] <darksydephil> Pops, i just saw that you update dthe sub badges, ill upload the new ones after this stream 

[12:16] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the restroom 

[12:16] <darksydephil> btw is the stream working? ill tweet out of it is 

[12:16] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:27] <darksydephil> ok im back 

[12:27] <darksydephil> give me a sec and we’ll start prestream 
[12:27] <darksydephil> BTW, the new emote was approved 
[12:28] <darksydephil> oh my god.... 

[12:28] <darksydephil> thats disgusting lol 
[12:29] <darksydephil> dspSexy 
[12:29] <darksydephil> aw wtf 




[12:29] <darksydephil> think i have to refresh 
[12:29] <darksydephil> dspSexy 

[12:30] <darksydephil> i can't add any more emotes until i hit 250 subs, sadly i only have like 115 now 
[12:30] <darksydephil> tons of people didnt resub :( 

[12:31] <darksydephil> i had over 140 subs at one point 

[12:31] <darksydephil> so thats over 20 people woh only subbed for a month 

[14:16] <darksydephil> LOL some other streamer or YTer complained to their fans that they're banned in this 

chat but have never talked in it 

[14:16] <darksydephil> that's literally impossible 

[14:17] <darksydephil> OnlyAfroGames 

[14:17] <darksydephil> no idea who that is 

[14:18] <darksydephil> well apparently he tried to come here today and tweeted that he's banned so his followers 
of course are making jokes etc. 

[14:19] <darksydephil> anyway, do you guys see my point about this game though? why are normal enemies 1-2 

shotting me dead randomly but Manus can't kill me? lol 

[14:19] <darksydephil> its not scaled properly at all 

[15:18] <darksydephil> final boss in DS3 is far better than Gwyn 

[15:18] <darksydephil> way more attack patterns and multiple phases, bosses in DS1 dont even have phases lol 
[15:19] <darksydephil> id love to do lost odyssey during a dead time of year, like summertime 
[15:19] <darksydephil> cant do it now though, far too many new releases coming up shortly 
[15:19] <darksydephil> i already did face artorious, and he did beat my ass 
[15:19] <darksydephil> i remember lol 

[15:20] <darksydephil> yes, i woudln’t be against another demons souls run. i really liked that game 
[15:20] <darksydephil> i wouldn’t even have to rebuy that one as i have the license for it already 
[15:20] <darksydephil> ive explained 100 times why i can’t do the bloodborne die, to keep asking for it is a sign 
of mass stupidity 

[15:20] <darksydephil> so please keep asking kappa 
[15:20] <darksydephil> oops 
[15:20] <darksydephil> Kappa 
[15:21] <darksydephil> this was a legit run 
[15:21] <darksydephil> i dont know how to dupe 
[15:21] <darksydephil> i never did 

[15:21] <darksydephil> people accused me of cheating in demons souls too when i dont know how to do it lol 
[15:21] <darksydephil> oh 

[15:22] <darksydephil> yeah, again, i dont know about any duping glitch, didnt know it exsited until people 
accused me of it 

[15:22] <darksydephil> i just grinded a TON off camera 
[15:22] <darksydephil> im not good, i just know the system and use it to win 
[15:22] <darksydephil> i didnt the first time i played these games 
[15:23] <darksydephil> ok folks im out, gonna start uploading 

[15:23] <darksydephil> and cool thing is, since i finished early, maybe i can start the dark souls montages and 
stuff sooner rather than later 
[15:23] <darksydephil> we’ll see! 

[15:23] <darksydephil> gotta finish my game of the year awards first 
[15:23] <darksydephil> peace out folks, see you tomorrow for zelda 
[15:24] <darksydephil> i have no game save file 

[15:25] <darksydephil> i had no room on the ps4 last yea rand had to delete everything, and it never uploaded to 
teh cloud because the WWE games for 2014 and 2015 had a bug where they uploaded DOZENS of gigs to the 
cloud and took up all the save space 

[15:25] <darksydephil> so theres no way i can ever go back to teh bloodborne die without replayign the entire 
game from the start, which im not doing 

[15:27] <darksydephil> it would take at least two MAJOR sreams to get back to the DLC and i’d have shit 



equipment, its not worth it, plus i dont own the game anymore 

[15:27] <darksydephil> lets face it, nobody is gonna watch me replay 6+ hours of bloodborne when i already did 
a legit run 

[15:27] <darksydephil> its not like Dark Souls at all, totally different situation 
[15:28] <darksydephil> gorillabaz, that's the basis of ALL OF TWITCH 
[15:28] <darksydephil> lololol 

[15:29] <darksydephil> like, you have a cool million people to ask that question if you have issue with it 

[15:29] <darksydephil> so why dont you head off and find out for yourself 

[15:29] <darksydephil> subs are paid 

[15:29] <darksydephil> bits are paid 

[15:29] <darksydephil> donations are paid 

[15:29] <darksydephil> enjoy someone else gaming, toss them a few bucks 
[15:29] <darksydephil> thats the entire premise of twitch 
[15:31] <darksydephil> donnie, the problem isn't the stream 

[15:31] <darksydephil> stream viewership doens't equate to money to pay my bills 

[15:31] <darksydephil> i either need subs, cheers or youtube views, and 6+ hours of replaying the beginning of 
bloodborne wont do that 

[15:31] <darksydephil> hell, you may not realize this, but when that die was new and i played it, it didn’t get 
much viewership. nobody really cared 

[15:32] <darksydephil> i dont see the time investment to get back to playing a die nobody cared about to begin 
with lol 

[15:33] <darksydephil> yup ill be playing breath of the wild for sure 

[15:33] <darksydephil> yes i think this did far better than a replay of RDR honestly, and i actually feel like i 

accomplished somethign out of it as well 

[15:34] <darksydephil> yup donniedarksouls makes sense 

[15:35] <darksydephil> lol Geoff, to be honest, i largely ignore people who troll me. you may have noticed i 
never directly responded to stuff you said or did, purposely 

[15:36] <darksydephil> its just that theres SO MANY PEOPLE who troll me, that when i do finally address 1-2, 
people think its like a normal thing that i do 

[15:38] <darksydephil> i dont take any offense honestly, unless someone does something to concretely hurt me 
for real 

[15:38] <darksydephil> nothing tha tyou did DarksydeGeoff every really HURT me, it was just silly stuff 
[15:38] <darksydephil> the shit these kids do now is just insane 

[15:38] <darksydephil> i almost can't do this as a job anymore because of the shit they did to my business 
[15:39] <darksydephil> i barely ever show up on ANY pages of youtube search videos 
[15:39] <darksydephil> thats why i lost over 40% of my business in the last 2 years 

[15:43] <darksydephil> none of it is fair use, at all, per my legal counsel, but youtube requires a lawsuit PER 
VIDEO to take anything down permanently 

[15:43] <darksydephil> and i dont hve the money or time to do that 

[15:43] <darksydephil> everyone who puts up a video and i take it down, and they dispute it? they've broken the 
law and i could sue the shit out of them if i had the money and time 
[15:44] <darksydephil> nope, because youtube's system is shit 

[15:44] <darksydephil> even people who upload exact copies can just dispute your claim 
[15:44] <darksydephil> and without a lawsuit, it goes right back up 
[15:46] <darksydephil> slashingtomcat, none of that is fair use 
[15:46] <darksydephil> sorry, its not 
[15:46] <darksydephil> my lawyer said so 

[15:47] <darksydephil> truth is, i could claim every single video on youtube that uses my footage for ad revenue 
purposes, but i dont have the time or resources to find every single one 

[15:47] <darksydephil> people used to tell me about them, now i dont even bother, im too busy doing my own 
thing 

[15:47] <darksydephil> i did in the past 



[15:48] <darksydephil> im not going to sit here and scour youtube daily for new *** videos and the like, thats 
nuts lol 

[15:49] <darksydephil> exactly 

[15:49] <darksydephil> their videos show up in YT search because they're crazy hour-long hatefests, and 
dumb fuck kids sit there and watch the entire slanderous videos, so they get high ranking in search 
[15:50] <darksydephil> my videos almost never show in YT search anymore because of the 2015 false copyright 
fiasco 

[15:52] <darksydephil> donnie 

[15:52] <darksydephil> you have to be intelligent about this 

[15:52] <darksydephil> those videos directly steal from me and harm my business for their own personal gain 
[15:52] <darksydephil> when you watch them, you're directly contributing to my failure on YT and inability to 
make more videos 

[15:52] <darksydephil> so by watching TIHYDP, you actually hurt yourself if you like my content.... 

[15:53] <darksydephil> how can you consciously choose to keep watching? 

[15:53] <darksydephil> its like a crazy paradox NOBODY wants to think about or admit 

[15:53] <darksydephil> let's all watch *** but never actually admit that it's destroyed Phil’s business since 2012. 
take no responsibility for it 

[15:54] <darksydephil> donnie, *** isn't my content, its illegal theft of my content for someone else's gain 

[15:54] <darksydephil> and it will END ME if people don't understand that 

[15:54] <darksydephil> you're literally shooting YOURSELF in the foot watching those videos 

[15:55] <darksydephil> you just said it 

[15:55] <darksydephil> because they’re big 

[15:55] <darksydephil> i was never big on a scale wehre that stuff woudln't hurt me 

[15:55] <darksydephil> and when i was growing to that size, *** singlehandedly flipped common opinion about 
me and stifled that growth 

[15:56] <darksydephil> donnie, the concrete proof will be when i'm gone from YT and twitch permanently 
because i can't pay my fucking bills! 

[15:57] <darksydephil> it's called the difference between being a mature adult with a conscience, or an immature 
vile shit who will take pleasure in the pain of others Geoff 

[15:57] <darksydephil> sadly the vast majority of YT viewers are immature little shits 

[15:58] <darksydephil> LOL that's right! Give up, stop uploading altogether, give up doing what i love for a 

living, lose the house, destroy my credit and lose everything, sounds like a sound game plan! 

[15:58] <darksydephil> that's what dumbfuck kids say 

[15:59] <darksydephil> donnie, i did last year, they got no viewership at all. nobody wants to watch someone 

make fun of tehmselves be they want to see the VILE side of it. the scathing insults and the like 

[15:59] <darksydephil> thanks skysands! It's awesome 

[16:00] <darksydephil> ok im out, gotta get stuff done and get dinner etc 

[19:11] <darksydephil> test

[11:56] <darksydephil> LOL are you silly or what 
[11:56] <darksydephil> publish my tax returns?? 

[11:56] <darksydephil> yes, make even more info public about me so it can be used against me. be they dont do 
that enough 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok im setting up the zelda stream right now 
[12:01] <darksydephil> should be live shortly 

[12:11] <darksydephil> stream up? if so im gonna tweet and then use teh restroom 
[12:11] <darksydephil> ive had to for 10 minutes lol 




[12:11] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:24] <darksydephil> looks like the capture software crashed, i just restarted it 

[12:30] <darksydephil> test 

[12:30] <darksydephil> ok there we go 

[12:30] <darksydephil> laptop wasnt working

[12:30] <darksydephil> dspSexy 

[12:31] <darksydephil> that new emote is pure troll fuel, people could spam the fuck out of other peoples 
streams with it lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170120-01 ZELDA OOT 3DS 6TH.LOG 

[11:56] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:58] <darksydephil> thanks! 

[11:58] <darksydephil> yeah i just saw it, very nice 
[12:02] <darksydephil> ok stream going live momentarily 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ive already said a million times it wont happen 
[12:05] <darksydephil> so grow up and shut up about it, seriously 

[12:05] <darksydephil> at this point its like a bunch of whiny kids who can't get their ice cream 
[12:07] <darksydephil> sooo 

[12:07] <darksydephil> i dont think theres any way to prevent being "hosted" on twitch 

[12:08] <darksydephil> every day when i turn on my stream i get notifications in chat that people are hosting me 
[12:08] <darksydephil> but i see no way to prevent that 

[12:08] <darksydephil> no? i know a few of them are detractors who watch the stream on their pages so they can 
have their own toxic chats, and they all have adblock enabled regardless, so i get nothing out of it 
[12:08] <darksydephil> no bits, no subs, no ad revenue, its basically theft, i dunno why twitch allows it 
[12:09] <darksydephil> i know some people are legit, for example theres a new feature to auto-host random 
channels and thats how a bunch of people host me 
[12:09] <darksydephil> but i recognize 2 names specifically 

[12:10] <darksydephil> people should NOT be hosting if the streamer doesn’t benefit, thats just stupid, like 
having my YT videos play on someone else's channel lol 

[12:10] <darksydephil> it doesn’t matter that adblock doesn't work, ads make no money here. 

[12:11] <darksydephil> its about the subs and bits, if these guys are hosting my stream just to shit on it, they 

shouldn’t be allowed to host at all since ill never potentially make anything off of it 

[12:11] <darksydephil> its exactly the same as ripping my video illegally from YT to make a *** 

[12:12] <darksydephil> anyway, its not a huge deal but i just find it really weird that twitch supports this, but not 
surprised 

[12:12] <darksydephil> they do a lot of things ass backwards 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yeah im not gonna dwell on it 

[12:12] <darksydephil> anyway, stream is live and working, correct? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> I am doing a Ni-Oh playtrhough. i announced this in my big schedule update a few 
weeks back 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i already played yakuza 4.... 

[12:13] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> anyway, ok good, let me tweet that we’re live 
[12:16] <darksydephil> i forgot to open my laptop lol 
[12:16] <darksydephil> its booted now 
[12:17] <darksydephil> yeah hold on, ill add audio in a sec 
[12:18] <darksydephil> ok audio now? 

[12:18] <darksydephil> ok good 
[12:18] <darksydephil> ill talk a bit as well

[12:27] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[12:27] <darksydephil> stream going live now 

[12:28] <darksydephil> im loving this Gerudo music, nothing in Zelda ever sounded like this again, so Latino lol 
[12:28] <darksydephil> guess it depends on what this next dungeon in the deser is lol 
[12:28] <darksydephil> cool 

[12:28] <darksydephil> hopefully ill clear at least one today 

[12:30] <darksydephil> so Twitch has now warned me that new auto-hosting is starting in 2 days about 10 times, 
and ive done what they said to do to deactivate it twice 
[12:30] <darksydephil> bets on if it still enables it anyway? lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> arthosfromtkoh : nobody to moderate chat when i'm not streaming, and who knows what 

the bad element would do with that lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i mprobably not doing a formal prestream today 

[12:37] <darksydephil> considering the game hasn’t given me any clue where the shadow temple is 
[12:37] <darksydephil> i dont see how its my fault if im doing another one first 
[12:38] <darksydephil> brb gonna pee, then we’ll start

[18:55] <darksydephil> testing 
[18:57] <darksydephil> testing 
[19:05] <darksydephil> testing again 
[19:08] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:08] <darksydephil> so im getting chat to work with OBS, its surprisingly easy but i wanted to try 

adjustments to size etc 

[19:09] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:09] <darksydephil> hmm interesting 

[19:09] <darksydephil> it seems to cut off the messages pretty quickly, lets see if i can adjust that 
[19:09] <darksydephil> im not sure what the criteria is to have them fade away etc 
[19:10] <darksydephil> yup tomorrow will be a first for sure 

[19:10] <darksydephil> let me try adjusting some settings right now to make the chat NOT fade away so quickly 
[19:11] <darksydephil> messages disappearing really quickly 

[19:11] <darksydephil> scrolling i dont think will be able to be controlled, be i dont want the entire side of the 
setream to be chat lol 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ive got the chat showing fine 

[19:12] <darksydephil> now i just gotta adjust it to be big enough, legible enough and not fade away too quickly 
i think 

[19:12] <darksydephil> i have no idea what's considered good for a stream as ive never done this before 
[19:13] <darksydephil> yeah i probably will just to mess with it a bit 

[19:13] <darksydephil> im also going to try a game, probably stardew since everyone voted for it 
[19:15] <darksydephil> ok so im gonna start up stardew valley 
[19:15] <darksydephil> and see if i can get it to fit the screen 

[19:15] <darksydephil> then ill start the stream, it’ll be awful but we’ll work on adjusting it on the fly here 
[19:16] <darksydephil> its going to be all PC i think 

[19:16] <darksydephil> be pretty much all of the other games suggested were pc games 

[19:16] <darksydephil> and i already own stardew on pc 

[19:16] <darksydephil> so no reason to rebuy it 

[19:16] <darksydephil> plus we can skip the boring intro crap 

[19:16] <darksydephil> yes jackbox and there was another very common one 

[19:16] <darksydephil> choice chamber 

[19:17] <darksydephil> wahtever that is lol 

[19:18] <darksydephil> let me get headphones plugged in and then boot up stardwew valley 





[19:18] <darksydephil> phone? how does that work?! 

[19:19] <darksydephil> its not a game on steam?? 

[19:20] <darksydephil> booting up stardew now 
[19:20] <darksydephil> ok im gonna get it in a few minutes 
[19:21] <darksydephil> ok im gonna start up the stream 
[19:21] <darksydephil> give me a sec

[12:07] <darksydephil> i dunno if anybody on youtube would want to watch this 

[12:07] <darksydephil> or should i just archive it on twitch like i did the Christmas special? hmm 

[12:08] <darksydephil> ok 

[12:08] <darksydephil> what ill do si, record in segments 

[12:08] <darksydephil> so like a segment for stardew, segment for jackbox etc

[12:00] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:01] <darksydephil> so a few people have told me that theres 2 sidequests i can complete before i beat 
Ocarina, but i have no idea how long they'll take and if there’s a final dungeon or not before Ganon 
[12:01] <darksydephil> i also have no idea how to even do one of them, lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> honestly? i like tekken but i think im goig to be far more into injustice, tekken 7 coming 
out 2nd is going to kill it 

[12:02] <darksydephil> RE7 broke street date last week, the entire game was already leaked on the net lol 

[12:02] <darksydephil> this happens with every single game now, its fucking sad 

[12:03] <darksydephil> ok setting up the stream now 

[12:07] <darksydephil> ok setting up now, should be live in a sec 

[12:07] <darksydephil> btw i just looked up the biggoron sword quest, fuck that ! 

[12:07] <darksydephil> it coudl take hours to do all those timed trades lol 
[12:08] <darksydephil> well i think ill do the gerudo training agin 
[12:08] <darksydephil> again 
[12:08] <darksydephil> then finish the game 

[12:08] <darksydephil> but yeah, it'll be shorter which is fine, i have to film the week in preview today as well 
before RE7 tonight 

[12:10] <darksydephil> Zelda is the only launch title for switch 
[12:13] <darksydephil> stream working fine? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> just refreshed the capture software as it looks like it crashed 
[12:13] <darksydephil> you should hear music now 

[12:17] <darksydephil> RE7 is the same in VR, except hte field of view is drastically reduced be of the PSVR's 

limitations, basically you're making the game harder be it's harder to see anything 

[12:20] <darksydephil> the same question asked by the same stupid people over and over 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i already got my moneys worth out of hte psvr honestly 

[12:21] <darksydephil> but id hope htere will be other games for it eventually 




[12:21] <darksydephil> it was $600 

[12:22] <darksydephil> probably both at this point 

[12:22] <darksydephil> i put out a shitload of vids on the psvr 

[15:11] <darksydephil> because he’s an idiot, lol 

[15:16] <darksydephil> game devs said in Breath of the Wild you can walk right up to the final dungeon's door 
but you can’t get it. its that open world lol 

[15:20] <darksydephil> PSVR is the best way to experience RE7? so with a sweaty face, fish-eye lens, blocked 
subtitles and narrow field of vision? LOL 
[15:20] <darksydephil> ok then

[12:05] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[12:05] <darksydephil> stream going live now 

[12:09] <darksydephil> the DLC for RE7 is only ONE extra episode, like probably an hour or two id guess, not 
worth the hefty price tag for the season pass, its a total capcom ripoff as usual 
[12:10] <darksydephil> i might play some overwatch this weekend 
[12:10] <darksydephil> but sorry, new releases take priority over that stuff 

[12:12] <darksydephil> they should piss everyone off and make the RE2 and 3 remakes in this RE7 engine, lol 
[12:12] <darksydephil> people would pop arteries over it being first person 

[12:16] <darksydephil> i feel bad for kingdom hearts 2.8 and that Tales game that got released today, literally 
nobody cares lol 

[12:16] <darksydephil> thats what happens when you time your releases poorly, there was all of January to 

release those and instead they do it the same day as RE7 

[12:17] <darksydephil> ok brb

[18:56] <darksydephil> stream is going live momentarily! 

[18:58] <darksydephil> its starting right now 
[19:02] <darksydephil> ok stream working? 

[19:02] <darksydephil> if so ill tweet we’re live and we'll get started shortly 
[19:03] <darksydephil> 2 more hours tonight 

[19:03] <darksydephil> then we'll see how much is left tomorrow i gues 

[19:03] <darksydephil> i get the feeling the story of this game will be that it's great but far too short 
[19:05] <darksydephil> because this is 2017 

[19:05] <darksydephil> and when you can buy games that provide 20-40 hours of great content for $60, you 
need to provide an equivalent experience 

[19:06] <darksydephil> thats like saying a 20 minute movie is just as good as a 2 hour one despite paying the 
same amount of money to see them lol 






[19:06] <darksydephil> Suckasurprise : i haven't cared about EVO for over 8 years. So the answer would be no, 
because I still do not care lol 

[19:09] <darksydephil> Mafia II was an amazing 10 hour game, but everyone complained it was too short 
[19:09] <darksydephil> so they added 20 hours of grinding to Mafia III and it sucked lol 
[19:10] <darksydephil> i bet once you know where everything is, you can beat htis game in under 2 hours lol 
[19:10] <darksydephil> RE1 had some crazy speedruns where you never fire a bullet until you absolutely have 
to, which is basically most of the game 

[19:12] <darksydephil> its damn good so far, but lets see how the 2nd half is 
[19:12] <darksydephil> it could fizzle out

[12:10] <darksydephil> piece of shit site 

[12:12] <darksydephil> ok finally got the stream info to update 
[12:13] <darksydephil> twitch has been giving me problems with it lately 
[15:13] <darksydephil> i am streaming at 60fps, lol. twitch can't handle it 

[15:14] <darksydephil> the game IS 60fps, im playing in it and recording at 60fps. but twitch streaming can't 
handle it because their bitrate limitations are ridiculously low 
[16:15] <darksydephil> nobody cares 

[16:15] <darksydephil> if he's clowning me it means he's so fucking boring he can't entertain his own audience 
with actual meaningful content

guy on twitch to get donations for doing nothing doesn't mean he's changed, he’s just acting 
[16:20] <darksydephil> well truth is, i dont care, im sure tons of FGC people still talk shit about me on the 
regular, that's what happens when you're a boring no-talent fuck who is desperate to make people laugh 
[16:21] <darksydephil> Injustice 2 in may, tekken 7 injune, i’d say yes lol 
[16:23] <darksydephil> um 

[16:23] <darksydephil> FLoe played way more than me because he didn’t have to hold down a job. his parents 
were rich and paid his spoiled ass to travel the world and play Street Fighter while i was busting my ass to get 
through college 

[16:24] <darksydephil> to say Floe is more successful than me is like saying someone who plays Basketball all 
day every day is better than someone who plays once a week 

[16:25] <darksydephil> so please, do not pick this fight, you will lose. Floe was always a negative nasty piece of 
shit and there are tons of people who will corroborate that story 

[16:25] <darksydephil> Viscant sat around playing internet poker to make money, but he is far more naturally 
talented than FLoe, i’d say, and he's a much nicer person too 
[16:27] <darksydephil> actually it really was 

[16:27] <darksydephil> i never got to practice half as much as the guys who won tournaments, they went to 
EVERY major, every big event and played about 10 times more than me 

[16:27] <darksydephil> every time i went to a tourney it was like trying to play catchup for 3 months of practice 
i didnt get 

[16:28] <darksydephil> but thats just life, some people get it easier than others, i didnt have it easy and didn’t 
have that freedom to actually play all the time 

[16:29] <darksydephil> what the fuck does that have to do with me and Floe? it's a completely unrelated topic 
[16:29] <darksydephil> its not even the same games lol 

[16:30] <darksydephil> listen, if you want to suck Floe's cock, go ahead, if you want to say i'm a bad fighting 
game player, go ahead, none of that has to do with the topic, which is that Floe is a piece of shit and his talking 
shit about me on his stream is HILARIOUS, i could roast the fuck out of that guy daily but i actually have 
meaningful work to do 
[16:31] <darksydephil> dude 

[16:31] <darksydephil> you're the only person here talking about his 

[16:31] <darksydephil> you have nothing to say pertinent to what was being discussed lol 

[16:39] <darksydephil> it's like I said, when you have nothing whatsoever to offer the world, you shit on others 

to create "entertainment." it's pathetic 

[16:40] <darksydephil> he's literally the last person on Earth who should be talking shit about anyone, but 
because it's the internet, he hides behind it lol 
[16:42] <darksydephil> "just name call" 

[16:42] <darksydephil> are you daft? 

[16:42] <darksydephil> i just gave you a million reasons why the guy is a piece of shit 

[16:43] <darksydephil> the only reason we’re talking about this is because he decided to insult me on his stream 
when i never, ever, EVER mention the guy and i'm not part of the FGC for how many years now? lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170127-01 YAKUZA 0 2ND.LOG 

[11:50] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:50] <darksydephil> i see people talking about being bored with yakuza, i feel ya 

[11:50] <darksydephil> that start was very slow 

[11:50] <darksydephil> i myself am hoping it picks up today 

[11:52] <darksydephil> well ok, let's hope chapter 2 is short then lol 

[11:53] <darksydephil> the disco dancing was at least something silly/different 

[11:54] <darksydephil> I blitzed it be I'm way better at the game now lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> that final boss was very challenging but i was able to adapt quickly 




[11:55] <darksydephil> yes that's tomorrow on stream 

[11:55] <darksydephil> and Sunday is the For Honor beta and Venomousfatman is going to co-op it with me 
[11:55] <darksydephil> so the weekend should be fun and full of variety 
[11:56] <darksydephil> yup we've been watching classic rumbles to prepare 
[11:58] <darksydephil> then i’d say its not healthy to be a youtuber in general lol 
[11:58] <darksydephil> thanks RetroCerberus ! 

[11:59] <darksydephil> so for those who have been watching my streams this week 
[11:59] <darksydephil> how do they look? 

[11:59] <darksydephil> im curious if anything actually looks like 60fps and smooth on source quality 
[12:00] <darksydephil> be i only see a downgraded version of the stream on my dashboard page and it looks 
awful always lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> yeah vsevolodeliseev i can say i’m very pleased with teh direct capture vids, doing them 
at 720p/60fps was the way to go. they look great on youtbe 
[12:00] <darksydephil> youtube 

[12:02] <darksydephil> this game is a good one to balance between other stuff, i wont be in a hurry to finish it 
[12:03] <darksydephil> um Guildassassin ive finished THREE other Yakuza games, for the record, kind of 
talking out of your butthole there 
[12:03] <darksydephil> ok so stream is working fine? 

[12:03] <darksydephil> oh look 
[12:03] <darksydephil> ive spotted a moron 
[12:04] <darksydephil> goodbye, moron 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:04] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we’re live and then get stuff working on the laptop 

[12:06] <darksydephil> fademadaway : Floe is a moron, talking shit about me is the most attention he's gotten in 
a while so he's talking to himself i guess, i ended it last night and as far as i’m concerned, the guy can suck an egg 
[12:07] <darksydephil> and yeah, apparently I am one of the few English steramer/Lefs Players who plays 
Yakuza games 

[12:07] <darksydephil> it's huge in Japanese though lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> i thi nk its just TOO Japanese culture-centric to catch on lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> but i personally like it because it immerses me in a culture i’m not used to 

[12:13] <darksydephil> oh, evil death, did you submit better fanart? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> i guess i missed it? 

[12:14] <darksydephil> we're weaiting evil death, we all want to see your fanart 
[12:17] <darksydephil> stupid FGC emotes lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> then again im sure some of my subs spam my ugly face in other chats so 
[12:17] <darksydephil> it's all good 
[14:51] <darksydephil> chat frozen? 

[16:22] <darksydephil> hey pspgaming3 

[16:22] <darksydephil> say something vile like that again to another chatter and you'll find yourself banned 
[16:22] <darksydephil> just because im not streaming doesn't mean i can't see what you type, dumbass 
[16:22] <darksydephil> a joke? 

[16:23] <darksydephil> that wasn’t a joke, that was sexual harassment 
[16:23] <darksydephil> you should probably apologize now 
[16:23] <darksydephil> Gee, i wonder why 

[16:24] <darksydephil> im sure they came here to hear your gross sexual advances 
[16:25] <darksydephil> it wasn't a small thing, kid 
[16:27] <darksydephil> you sexually harassed another chatter 
[16:27] <darksydephil> it wasn't funny nor phrased as a joke 

[16:28] <darksydephil> if you keep going, you're going to be banned, this is now your second warning 
[16:29] <darksydephil> ok then 

[16:29] <darksydephil> some people just can’t be helped, stupid is stupid

[12:25] <darksydephil> running through the unlockables, then we’ll begin streaming 

[12:25] <darksydephil> had to play 2 quick tutorials to get the currency lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> yeah for some reason theres tons of stuff you have to do before you can play this online

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170130-01 YAKUZA 0 3RD.LOG 

[11:58] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:59] <darksydephil> im setting up now 

[12:00] <darksydephil> they also had tons of signs saying "where is the ascension" 

[12:00] <darksydephil> that whole front area were total trolls, a Mr. Bean sign too 
[12:05] <darksydephil> ooh the 2 month sub badges went into effect? 

[12:05] <darksydephil> or are those 3. i forget lol 
[12:05] <darksydephil> its cumulative 

[12:05] <darksydephil> as long as you stay subbed you get the better badges 

[12:06] <darksydephil> and this is cool, as my icon will change as soon as the upgrades happen 

[12:06] <darksydephil> yeah i do have to say that the silver crown is quite sharp 

[12:07] <darksydephil> Twitch won't exist in 20 years lol 

[12:08] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? if so ill tweet it out 

[12:09] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:43] <darksydephil> typing something 

[14:18] <darksydephil> yeah, im not a scrub, not dying on this boss lol 

[14:20] <darksydephil> of course he's a casual lol 

[14:20] <darksydephil> he plays about 1/10th the amount of games i do 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170131-01 YAKUZA 0 4TH.LOG 

[11:48] <darksydephil> hello 

[11:49] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[11:51] <darksydephil> yeah 

[11:51] <darksydephil> today is the first day in almost 3 years that we don't have pets, we got the hamsters only 
a couple of days after we moved in, before the furniture was even here 
[11:52] <darksydephil> so this has hit us pretty hard 
[11:52] <darksydephil> not immediately 

[11:52] <darksydephil> we have a lot going on right now, between work and finances and such, dont want to 
take on any new responsibilities until we get some stuff sorted out 

[11:52] <darksydephil> as tempting as it is to run out and get another pet, it would be irresponsible 
[11:53] <darksydephil> yeah its like i said on twitter last night 

[11:53] <darksydephil> between being sick and having to tough through it to pay bills, my finances being awful, 
youtube ripping me off yet again, the lost of our pets etc. its just like one thing after another after another 
[11:53] <darksydephil> i do my best to come out every day and keep at this, but it does get tough from time to 
time 

[11:55] <darksydephil> let's just hope things can somehow turn around in the next few weeks, i seriously, badly 
need some good news to turn the tides here 
[11:57] <darksydephil> hmm 





[11:57] <darksydephil> perhaps i forgot to update all of them, because you're right pops 
[11:57] <darksydephil> ill look into it in a sec 

[11:59] <darksydephil> I believe so. That week is MLB and the Dark Souls DLC i think 

[12:01] <darksydephil> ok so i have to delete ALL the silver badges in order to fix this, so they're going to 

disappear for a few minutes, then come back 

[12:01] <darksydephil> so dont freak out if the silver badges are gone out of nowhere lol 
[12:02] <darksydephil> ok done 

[12:02] <darksydephil> so give it a few and hopefully it updates 
[12:02] <darksydephil> if not im not sure whats goin on lol 
[12:03] <darksydephil> no, thats not how it works lol 

[12:03] <darksydephil> you get free auto-subbed to your own channel so you can use your own emotes 

[12:03] <darksydephil> i actually haven't used my free twitch prime sub 

[12:04] <darksydephil> ok 

[12:04] <darksydephil> silver badge updated 

[12:04] <darksydephil> looks way better now 

[12:04] <darksydephil> refresh if you haven't and you’ll see the new one 
[12:04] <darksydephil> nice! 

[12:05] <darksydephil> yeah Pops redid the smallest version of the sub badges and they look far better now 
[12:05] <darksydephil> if you dont see a difference you probably dont use the smallest version, it depends on 
how big the chat is on your device 

[12:06] <darksydephil> yeah pc tends to use the mid or high level badges and emotes 
[12:10] <darksydephil> every single twitch streamer probably don’t do their taxes properly, lol 
[12:10] <darksydephil> no lie, its pretty easy to say its "under the gift exemption" and not pay taxes on it. 
chances are most twitch streamers wont get audited 

[12:10] <darksydephil> but ive been doing this for a LONG time and have a professional accountant who knows 
his shit 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i have to be sure im covered because trust me, i have enough problems outside of tax 
issues 

[12:11] <darksydephil> spade: im pretty sure almost nobody has a dean of an accounting school as their 
accountant like i do, lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> i sought this guy out on purpose when this youtube thing got serious 

[12:12] <darksydephil> if you just get funds pouring into your paypal without any kind of screen, or checks, its 

INCREDIBLy unsafe for taxes 

[12:13] <darksydephil> like, if you dont have accountability of where your income is coming from, you could 
potentially get audited for thousands of dolalrs in back taxes, and the fees on that would be INSANE 
[12:14] <darksydephil> pledging to my patreon is exactly the same as sending me a donation via paypal, only 
theres a safe tax screen so i dont go to jail lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> if you can’t understand that, then sadly, i cannot accept your contribution, soryr 
[12:14] <darksydephil> sorry 

[12:14] <darksydephil> its not worth jailtime for me to take your money lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> JAILTIME 

[12:14] <darksydephil> what do you think lol 

[12:15] <darksydephil> spade, thats not true, it doesn't publicly show every single persons patreon contribution, 
and you can just make up any name if you dont want anybody to know you're a patron 
[12:15] <darksydephil> dxfreedom: he might have set up a private paypal account JUST for business 
purposes/twitch, like a separate banka ccount and paypal just for that 
[12:16] <darksydephil> ok is the stream live and working? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> amazon owns twitch, so having to sign up is no surprise 

[12:17] <darksydephil> DXFreedom: setting up a totally new bank account and paypal would be a ton of work 
and costly too. they require a minimum balance and a set amount of time etc. I don’t even have that much money 
to put into it honestly 

[12:18] <darksydephil> especially when i alreayd have two other, completely legitimate ways to get donations, 



theres no need to set up a totally different bank account for this 

[12:19] <darksydephil> for a business account its $500 i believe, not positive 

[12:20] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 

[12:23] <darksydephil> yup im doing chapter 3 right now, and finding side stuff for majima to do 
[12:23] <darksydephil> just playe dblackjack and won big lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> im probably not going to get an injustice code at this point, it seems they handpicked the 
people they wanted to promote the game, and then did some random ones and thats it 
[12:26] <darksydephil> the next character will be...ELONGATED MAN! 

[13:06] <darksydephil> no, why PAY to just talk to agirl is what im saying
