-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170801-01 SONIC ADVENTURE 1ST.LOG 

[12:14] <darksydephil> wassap everyone! 

[12:14] <darksydephil> setting up now, got lots of new stuff to add for today's premiere 
[12:14] <darksydephil> new pics, new fanart 

[12:21] <darksydephil> so we've got seven pieces of fanart and a totally new set of sonic popups for 
subs/tips/cheers today that will also work for sonic mania later this month 
[12:21] <darksydephil> pretty damn sweet 

[12:23] <darksydephil> yeah KushiYakitori emotes are all manual entry, would have have to delete one in order 
to add a sonic one 

[12:23] <darksydephil> and then get it through the approval process etc 

[12:23] <darksydephil> im thinking eventually theyll automate that process better but who knows what people 
would put into it if it WAS automated, dicks and teh like lol 
[12:26] <darksydephil> okay nearly ready to start 

[12:27] <darksydephil> lol i just realized, Machinima was purchased by Warner Brothers last year, yet they did 

absolutely nothing with Injustice 2 special for their partners, what a waste haha 

[12:32] <darksydephil> HOLY FUCK 

[12:32] <darksydephil> i booted the game 

[12:32] <darksydephil> its LOUD AS HELL 

[12:32] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> it's louder than danganronpa 2 lol 
[12:34] <darksydephil> live and learn is from sonic adventure 2, not 1 
[12:34] <darksydephil> 1 had the better soundtrack by far 
[12:38] <darksydephil> okay, stream working? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> why would there be sound on the xbox 360 dashboard? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> ill tweet out that we're live 
[12:39] <darksydephil> thi sisn’t the dx version 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i wasnt paying more money for stuff that didnt effect the game 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170801-02 SONIC ADVENTURE 2ND.LOG 

[19:21] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:28] <darksydephil> um 

[19:28] <darksydephil> whats going on in here? 

[19:34] <darksydephil> ok flushed a few turds 
[19:34] <darksydephil> stream should have just went live 
[19:35] <darksydephil> good 

[19:35] <darksydephil> equally fun, chaotic and glitchy 

[19:35] <darksydephil> pretty fun to play overall, and i love the soundtrack 

[19:36] <darksydephil> the game is 60fps yes 

[19:37] <darksydephil> the dreamcast failed be of a unique combination of factors, one of the worst being 
piracy, most games had no real protection from being ripped and copied, everyone i knew had a library of 
downloaded games 

[19:37] <darksydephil> are we good to go? if so ill tweet it out 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170802-01 TACOMA.LOG 

[12:33] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:34] <darksydephil> so this game is from the makers of Gone Home, a game i loved, my viewers liked and 
then everyone afterward jumped on a hate bandwagon for 
[12:34] <darksydephil> so ...yeah 






[12:36] <darksydephil> Gone Home was the first "walking simulator" i ever played and the stream viewers liked 
it a lot 

[12:40] <darksydephil> okay, stream working? 

[12:44] <darksydephil> um, i didnt clear my nose errnoent so you may be listening to a different stream haha 
[13:30] <darksydephil> the code is: 32893-B4J2I-9787C 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170802-02 SONIC ADVENTURE 3RD.LOG 

[19:19] <darksydephil> tacoma stuck! in processing lol 

[19:19] <darksydephil> Tacoma would have been much better if there was a core gameplay element, like some 
puzzles or something 

[19:20] <darksydephil> the passwords was something but there were only like 4 of them 
[19:28] <darksydephil> okay almost got the tacoma situation in hand lol 
[19:34] <darksydephil> okay, ready for more Sonic fun? 

[19:35] <darksydephil> i believe knuckles' theme is actually bad rap 

[19:35] <darksydephil> so yeah, i probably will lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> ok are we good? stream live and working? 

[19:43] <darksydephil> not my fan 
[19:43] <darksydephil> thats the game pasued 

[19:43] <darksydephil> im going to tweet that we're live and start now 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170803-01 SONIC ADVENTURE 4TH.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:29] <darksydephil> what a busy morning 

[12:31] <darksydephil> by the way, just tweeted that YT is getting sued and per the lawsuit, YT make be 
completely fucked lol 

[12:31] <darksydephil> those morons didn’t put anything in their TOS saying they can unilaterally change 

monetization terms without notice 

[12:31] <darksydephil> no idea 

[12:32] <darksydephil> that would be on Google 

[12:34] <darksydephil> no, according to the lawsuit and contract/TOS that im reading, YT is actually fucked, not 
only do they entirely automate the website, they didn’t legally cover their own asses lol 
[12:34] <darksydephil> ok stream is going live now 

[12:38] <darksydephil> yeah the lawsuit is really interesting, it's not only holding YouTube accountable for 
making the new ad changes without disclosing the info publicly but also for targeting certain channels falsely be 
their new algorithm is garbage 

[12:38] <darksydephil> so its a double whammy lawsuit really that could affect everyone 
[12:39] <darksydephil> and since YouTube agreed to do business based off of California law, if there's anything 
in California law preventing this kind of monopolistic business making these kinds o fchanges without disclosing 
it, the'yre completely fucked, zombiegoboom will win a judgement and YT will have to change the way they do 
shit 

[12:40] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay ill twet that we're live 
[12:43] <darksydephil> tweet 

[12:44] <darksydephil> i'm seriously lucky i do raw gameplay which is 100% compatible with twitch 
[12:48] <darksydephil> that was the best pull ive ever had in any video game ever haha 
[15:22] <darksydephil> suck for me, bitch 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170803-02 DANGANRONPA 2 14TH.LOG 

[19:30] <darksydephil> who's ready for danganronpa? 

[19:31] <darksydephil> okay let me get it started then 

[19:32] <darksydephil> yeah now its the 2nd half, and i have no idea who the real killer is yet 
[19:36] <darksydephil> ok stream up adn working well? 






[19:40] <darksydephil> the only suspect i have in this particular case it the mechanic kid 
[19:40] <darksydephil> but overall? I think Byakuya isn't dead. I think the game pulled a Junko 
[19:40] <darksydephil> yes the volume is low 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170804-01 SONIC ADVENTURE 5TH FINALE & SONIC ADVENTURE 2 

1ST.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> whoa 
[12:29] <darksydephil> test? 

[12:30] <darksydephil> aha 

[12:30] <darksydephil> well i couldn’t get stream chat to work anywhere for like 5 minutes 

[12:30] <darksydephil> just kept saying unable to connect 

[12:30] <darksydephil> it just started working 

[12:32] <darksydephil> okay i think we’re good to go now 

[12:32] <darksydephil> let me just refresh teh dashboard first 

[12:33] <darksydephil> nah prestream should be short 

[12:33] <darksydephil> nothing to talk about to day really 

[12:33] <darksydephil> unless people cheer like crazy, then it may take a bit to respond to everyone lol 
[12:35] <darksydephil> great, electrumguy can write the next algorithm that completely tanks YouTube! 
[12:38] <darksydephil> stream working folks? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:39] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted 

[12:45] <darksydephil> if people dont like them, then why do they continously cheer and keep asking more 
questions to make it longer lol 

[13:40] <darksydephil> the mason jar needs to be pressurized MrPapaveraceae 

[13:40] <darksydephil> or else it'll still go bad 

[15:18] <darksydephil> so SHadow debuted in this game, right? 

[17:29] <darksydephil> jealous idiots lol 

[17:30] <darksydephil> no idea what it is nor do i care lol 

[17:31] <darksydephil> just another negative thing to capitalize on ridicule and drama rather than something 
constructive or positive, toxic bullshit from worthless people 

[17:33] <darksydephil> only talentless, worthless people would focus on the fails of others rather than do 
something productive themselves 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170804-02 DANGANRONPA 2 15TH.LOG 

[19:31] <darksydephil> sup 
[19:33] <darksydephil> yeah i love it 

[19:33] <darksydephil> auto claimed for a song not in the fucking game 

[19:33] <darksydephil> it doesn’t, youtubes automated algorithms are fucked and always have been

daily, i dont violate twitch's TOS ever 

[19:36] <darksydephil> with the amount of false reports that have been put in, trust me, id be long banned if i

[12:43] <darksydephil> hey all 

[12:43] <darksydephil> sorry im late 

[12:43] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ill try to skip a long prestream today 

[12:46] <darksydephil> time to remove KingJezal's insane cheer lol 

[12:46] <darksydephil> last night 

[12:46] <darksydephil> a crazy cheer war broke out before danganronpa 2, really surprising 

[12:47] <darksydephil> probably people just in a good and generous mood 

[12:47] <darksydephil> they started around 100 bits each 

[12:47] <darksydephil> and grew to over 10000 a pop haha 

[12:52] <darksydephil> testing 

[12:52] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[12:52] <darksydephil> can anyone see this? 

[12:52] <darksydephil> ah okay good 

[12:52] <darksydephil> im getting the laptop set up and its giving me trouble 
[12:52] <darksydephil> finally working now 

[12:53] <darksydephil> a long ass time, i think i got it in 2013 but not sure, may have been 2012 
[12:54] <darksydephil> okay almost ready to go live 

[12:54] <darksydephil> all streams are deleted on twitch, i record teh videos and upload to my DSPGaming 
channel daily, thats where youc an watch 

[12:56] <darksydephil> as ive already said numerous times, i cant wear the sonic hat with my current 
headphones, it wont fit 

[12:56] <darksydephil> that Knuckles level was fucking terrible 

[12:57] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live, and we won’t do a formal prestream today since im late 

[12:59] <darksydephil> the entire console is lackluster 

[12:59] <darksydephil> why would the dashboard be any different lol 

[13:01] <darksydephil> theres absolutely no reason to own a switch right now, it has no killer app games, no 1st 
party exclusive games that are worth playing have been released, despite hte dumbfuck fanboys gizzing all over 
SPlatoon 2, which isn't anything special 

[13:01] <darksydephil> i like how since splatoon 2 released, absolutely nobody is talking about ARMS, shit, 
nobody has mentioned ARMS in months haha 
[13:01] <darksydephil> uuuuh 

[13:01] <darksydephil> botw is on wii u, its not a switch exclusive 
[13:02] <darksydephil> what mario game??? 

[13:02] <darksydephil> odyssey isn’t out.... 

[13:02] <darksydephil> sigh 

[13:02] <darksydephil> brb gonna piss and brush my hair, then we'll start 

[13:05] <darksydephil> adblocker doesn't work on twitch JcMauLer and im not running ads, so stop jerking 
yourself off, idiot 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170806-01 SONIC ADVENTURE 2 2ND.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> hello all 
[12:30] <darksydephil> almost ready to go! 

[12:30] <darksydephil> well of course, shit didnt work 





[12:31] <darksydephil> the mic on my turtle beach headset somehow broke 
[12:31] <darksydephil> and wouldnt’ work at all 

[12:31] <darksydephil> so i had to use my astros that sound like utter shit 

[12:31] <darksydephil> yeah i guess he's trying to touch up the audio be a lot of people complained 
[12:32] <darksydephil> yeah the mic doesn't work at all, if i like SMASH the little receiver thing it'll work for 
like 10 seconds and then die out again 

[12:36] <darksydephil> so i have an idea for this month's patreon goal 

[12:36] <darksydephil> it'll be a first of sorts because even if we don’t hit the goal, those who pledge will stil get 
something out of it 

[12:36] <darksydephil> and if we DO hit the goal, then something better happens 

[12:37] <darksydephil> ill talk on prestream, ive already mentioned it but i think i finally solidified the idea 
[12:38] <darksydephil> lol karlis 

[12:38] <darksydephil> i have to remember i have the soundmaker thing 
[12:38] <darksydephil> ok is the stream good so i can tweet?

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170808-01 HELLBLADE 1ST.LOG 

[12:23] <darksydephil> permadeath is confirmed false 

[12:24] <darksydephil> pc gamer purposely died 50 times and the "rot" apparently stops at some point, it's a plot 
device, not a game mechanic, but advanced reviewers all took it as a game mechanic without testing it and put it 
into their reviews 

[12:25] <darksydephil> yeah, sadly, explaining why spoils the fucking game 
[12:25] <darksydephil> if reviewers would just do their fucking jobs, nobody would be spoiled now 
[12:25] <darksydephil> but now we all are 
[12:25] <darksydephil> it's lame as hit 






[12:25] <darksydephil> as shit 

[12:26] <darksydephil> the problem IS the advanced review copies 
[12:26] <darksydephil> it literally created this situation we're in now 
[12:26] <darksydephil> the entire practice needs to fucking stop, i've had it 

[12:26] <darksydephil> there's literally no way to have a fun plot device or surprise anymore because of this 
stupid bullshit 

[12:28] <darksydephil> yeah everyone seems to be saying tha tHellblade is AAA quality but short, which iswhy 

they're only selling it for $30 

[12:31] <darksydephil> its false Deep_Drive 

[12:31] <darksydephil> pc gamer confirmed it 

[12:31] <darksydephil> they purposely died 50 times 

[12:31] <darksydephil> at one point the "mechanic" stops advancing 

[12:34] <darksydephil> damn a lot of subs expired 

[12:34] <darksydephil> hopefully we get some back today! 

[12:34] <darksydephil> can't wait for more Batman tonight, keeping Troy Baker employed 
[12:35] <darksydephil> and my dashboard says 0 viewers lol 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i swear to god, the twitch dashboard will never actually fully work 
[12:36] <darksydephil> is the stream at least working for you all? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:39] <darksydephil> im completely confused on what these devs made lol 
[12:40] <darksydephil> oh did they? 

[12:40] <darksydephil> enslaved was pretty good 

[17:08] <darksydephil> thanks to everyone who tipped, no lie, just got a low balance notice and transferring 
funds over to the bank account right now 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170808-02 BATMAN S2EP1.LOG 

[19:29] <darksydephil> what do you guys think about Batman, facecam o rno facecam? 

[19:30] <darksydephil> hmm okay 

[19:30] <darksydephil> FYI im just adding thumbnails to the hellblade vids, then i can get started with batman 
[19:36] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:36] <darksydephil> got hellblade squared away, now for this batman stream! 

[19:38] <darksydephil> buy now for what? 

[19:38] <darksydephil> the game someone streams? 

[19:38] <darksydephil> yeah its new. they added the option 2 months ago but i dont think it actually ever worked 

yet. i was waiting to hear when you guys started seeing it 

[19:38] <darksydephil> if you buy the game, i make money no lie 

[19:38] <darksydephil> i set it up so that game sales give me credit here 

[19:39] <darksydephil> it is only certain games Matvey_IS you are correct 

[19:40] <darksydephil> Micgelo09 honestly im just not feeling another multiplayer only game that will just get 

dropped and forgotten within a week lol 

[19:40] <darksydephil> they're wasted money a this point 

[19:40] <darksydephil> same thing with splatoon 2, it would have been a waste of time 
[19:41] <darksydephil> play two sessions, everyone's already bored 
[19:41] <darksydephil> is what FlyEaglesFlyOl ? 

[19:41] <darksydephil> oh i honestly have no idea FlyEaglesFlyOl 

[19:41] <darksydephil> its whatever you see there, click it and see if you can select dfif versions 
[19:42] <darksydephil> if you can, great, if not, i guess not lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> cheers will be enabled because this game is brand spanking new and only the first 
episode so i doubt spoilers are even really possible 

[19:43] <darksydephil> a far cry from a game like dananronpa 2 thats been out for ages and easily spoilable 
[19:43] <darksydephil> this is season 2, batman kills EVERYONE! that's the new twist 
[19:45] <darksydephil> LOL jmon_1985 its the forced die i bet 




[19:45] <darksydephil> where you have to download the die even if you didnt buy it! 

[19:46] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[19:46] <darksydephil> oh god, i actually forgot about the glitches lol! 

[19:46] <darksydephil> well new emote incoming i guess 

[19:46] <darksydephil> this time all we see are floating nipples, everyone is just a pair of air nips 
[19:48] <darksydephil> shit i need to change the cheer popups to generic, one sec all 
[19:48] <darksydephil> then i can talk! lol 
[23:49] <darksydephil> you heard very wrong 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170809-01 HELLBLADE 2ND FINALE (SAUCY WEDNESDAY).LOG 

[12:33] <darksydephil> test 

[12:33] <darksydephil> is this working? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> oh nice 

[12:34] <darksydephil> i had to type something to get it to work for some reason lol 

[12:35] <darksydephil> soo some pretty good news, not only this sauce turning out well, but my legs are sore 
from standing for 2 hours, the reason that's good is, i haven’t had that happen in 10 years be of my back injury, 
it's always my back that hurts first. 

[12:35] <darksydephil> so that means my back is like, WAY better 
[12:37] <darksydephil> something about Pratt and Farris didn't seem right 
[12:37] <darksydephil> i have no idea if thats how you spell her name btw 

[12:37] <darksydephil> but for some reason they just looked awkward together, i dunno, just a random 

observation i made 

[12:38] <darksydephil> yes she was 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i dont thinks he’s been acting in a while 

[12:39] <darksydephil> but she was in a few high profile movies so probably made bank 

[12:40] <darksydephil> once you make a certain amount you're good, i think its 30 million USD or something. 

you can easily live off interest for the rest of your life 

[12:45] <darksydephil> this is the PS4 dashboard 

[12:45] <darksydephil> that's quite interesting 

[12:46] <darksydephil> who cares 

[12:46] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:46] <darksydephil> it's something different, i had the dark souls one for 7 months 
[12:46] <darksydephil> is the stream working? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> ok cool, let me tweet that we’re live 

[12:46] <darksydephil> nope tonight is danganronpa 2, tomorrow is sonic's conclusion

[19:57] <darksydephil> its down to less than 3k players at peak hours and dropping daily 

[19:58] <darksydephil> the problem is, there is zero demand for this kind of FPS game yet these game studios 

keep fucking making them 

[19:58] <darksydephil> im at a loss lol 

[19:59] <darksydephil> dear game studios: stop making MP only games with no longevity, stop copying what 

everyone else did, because you're not good enough lol

years and ive been intrigued to try i tout 

[12:31] <darksydephil> yeah i heard the original Siren was good but insanely hard so they remade it in an 
episodic format for ps3 

[12:32] <darksydephil> i believe this game is only 30fps, correct? i didn’t boot it yet but it seems it would be

[12:28] <darksydephil> ah there we go 
[12:29] <darksydephil> my chat was frozen 
[12:30] <darksydephil> good lord, mvc3 sucks 
[12:30] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:31] <darksydephil> watched half of that match and i want to vomit 






[12:32] <darksydephil> its pretty much the fighting game for simpleton fucks who like flashy shit 

[12:32] <darksydephil> one hit = death in 95% of the cases 

[12:32] <darksydephil> that's not what a fighting gmae is supposed to be about 

[12:33] <darksydephil> ok stream going live now 

[12:34] <darksydephil> i cant believe how badly capcom lost their way 

[12:34] <darksydephil> mvc3, SF x Tekken and now SFV. all HUGE disappointments from a gameplay 
standpoint 

[12:34] <darksydephil> it just proves teh people who used to make the actual quality fighters moved on from the 
company 

[12:34] <darksydephil> usf2 is a nearly 10 year old game repackaged, they didnt actually make it 
[12:37] <darksydephil> okay, stream working ? 

[12:37] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:39] <darksydephil> im assuming you didn't watch my podcast retroparasite lol 
[12:39] <darksydephil> it has like a 25 minute segment covering that 

[12:39] <darksydephil> lol yeah retroparasite its live on THEKINGOFHATEVLOGS channel 

[12:40] <darksydephil> since Thursday 

[12:40] <darksydephil> brb gonna brush my hair 

[12:42] <darksydephil> i believe we’re either ending episode 5 or starting episode 6 
[12:42] <darksydephil> i think the first half of 6 just finished 
[12:42] <darksydephil> not sure though 

[12:43] <darksydephil> apparently the person who donated my Switch got it off amazon for normal price, just 
waited until they said they'd have stock 

[12:43] <darksydephil> it might be regional though, i have no idea 
[12:44] <darksydephil> will this music creep everyone out for prestream 
[12:44] <darksydephil> or should i mute it haha 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170813-01 ULTRA SF2 SWITCH 12TH.LOG 

[12:42] <darksydephil> hello everyone 
[12:42] <darksydephil> getting set up now 

[12:48] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up, then ill go grab drinks 

[12:48] <darksydephil> yeah i got caught up doing shit this morning, i always get a shitton of emails overnight 

[12:48] <darksydephil> damn down to 209 subs, whats going on here 

[12:48] <darksydephil> hopefully the new releases bring people back this week 

[12:49] <darksydephil> Derich so i found out what happened 

[12:49] <darksydephil> apparently you have 2 accounts on the forums which isn’t allowed, and then you reported 
2 posts with the lemur account which is against the rules unless there's something wrong with the posts 
[12:49] <darksydephil> so a mod thought you wer ea sock account 

[12:50] <darksydephil> so we kept the Lemur account unbanned, just be careful not to make more accounts or 
report posts by accident 

[12:51] <darksydephil> who's hype for my midnight release SOnic Mania stream tomorrow? 

[12:51] <darksydephil> im excited it's getting one digitally 
[12:51] <darksydephil> no, tomorrow, be it's 9pm release for me 
[12:52] <darksydephil> and Europe should wake the fuck up then! 

[12:52] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:52] <darksydephil> stream working all? 

[12:53] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live, then grab drinks 
[12:53] <darksydephil> because i forgot to remove it 
[12:53] <darksydephil> which i just did 

[13:01] <darksydephil> of course he is, he has no fucking life, he just sits all week waiting for me to play again 
[13:02] <darksydephil> theres no reason for me to play SFV again, even if they massively improved it to the 
point it's "good" (which they won’t) i'm E5 years behind now and won't catch up. so it’d be a waste of time 
[13:03] <darksydephil> so you guys like the classy menu music? lol 




[13:03] <darksydephil> so weird this is what they chose for a street tighter game but hey, remember vanilla SF4 
had jpop lol 

[13:04] <darksydephil> yes of cousre i would suvaki 

[13:04] <darksydephil> immediately there would be far more players and better connections 

[13:04] <darksydephil> so id switch 

[13:04] <darksydephil> i am wired Bobbi Ling 

[13:04] <darksydephil> as you can see, i thasn't helped 

[13:05] <darksydephil> the switch is wireless by default out of the box, but you can buy wired adapters

[19:43] <darksydephil> setting up now 
[19:43] <darksydephil> got some fan art, nice 

[19:48] <darksydephil> how could it be 8 hours if its only 12 zones? unless each zone is 3-4 stages 

[19:49] <darksydephil> also keep in mind, there's 3 playable characters so you can potentially play it 3 times and 

it’ll be totally different, flying/wall climbing really changed up the classic sonic games 

[19:49] <darksydephil> i remember going back into sonic 2 as knuckles and climbing all over the place, it was 
crazy 

[19:50] <darksydephil> that was the first instance ever of a game modding its previous iterations with new 
content 

[19:51] <darksydephil> Tails just flies over everything, just like in SA1, he broke the classic games too 

[19:52] <darksydephil> okay ill be back in like 15 or 20 minutes and well get stuff started up 

[19:52] <darksydephil> im letting the air conditioner cool the office down, wince it was 86 degrees when i 

walked in here 10 minutes ago

[12:32] <darksydephil> and it seems all the humor that made Saints Row good is completely missing or totally 
hits the mark. SHOOT HIM IN HIS BALLS

[12:30] <darksydephil> im talking from my desktop rignt now 

[12:31] <darksydephil> you never know Derich, it runs like molasses right now but its been surviving for years 
like that 

[12:32] <darksydephil> Jerry Lewis lived crazy long lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> 91 years for someone in show business is rare 

[12:32] <darksydephil> jackwhite202 if i do, just me talking to a camera for a few minutes, no more edited 
reviews per youtube demonetizing half the videos on kogaming 

[12:36] <darksydephil> im the only person that actually regularly plays USF2 on youtube/twitch aren’t i lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> everyone else dropped it fucking fast with how bad the online play is 

[12:37] <darksydephil> LOL yeah i heard tons of people just dropped agents of mayhem this last week 

[12:40] <darksydephil> gotta love those comments on dsp tries it, STILL referencing gout, when chicken has 

nothing to do with gout, doesn’t cause it and it just shows the insane stupidity of kids on the net 

[12:41] <darksydephil> the popeyes ive gone to always have terrible biscuits and no popeyes in Washington state 

has mac n cheese anymore 

[12:41] <darksydephil> so i guess its regional stuff 
[12:42] <darksydephil> okay, stream working everyone? 

[12:42] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:46] <darksydephil> nope steve_g08 i dont use facebook 
[12:47] <darksydephil> shit is far too insecure 

[12:47] <darksydephil> twitter is actually way better than facebook in that regard 

[12:49] <darksydephil> my facebook wasn’t hacked, but if someone attempts to log into it repeatedly nad fails, 
they lock your account and make you verify your identity by naming your friends, which is impossible if you 
have an online following with thousands of followers you dont know, the system is utter shit 




[12:49] <darksydephil> so after it got frozen three separate times, i got tired of fucking with those idiots and 

stopped using it entirely 

[15:46] <darksydephil> hey guys 

[15:46] <darksydephil> chill with that discussion thanks 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170821-01 AGENTS OF MAYHEM 5TH FINALE (HACKED).LOG 

[12:34] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:41] <darksydephil> yeah theres only 4 missions left 

[12:41] <darksydephil> may be a quick stream, which is fine, be i can review the game then 

[12:42] <darksydephil> i think the last review i did was Prey 

[12:42] <darksydephil> honestly the last game worthy of being reviewed 

[12:43] <darksydephil> oh thats right 

[12:43] <darksydephil> well time to start them up again 

[12:43] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:44] <darksydephil> okay time to tweet it out 

[12:45] <darksydephil> censoring yourself won’t make you ad friendly because its based on an algorithm that 
doesn't work lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> im certainly not ad friendly and i get like 10 vids flagged a month on DSPGaming, yet 
KOGaming which IS ad friendly had half the videos demonetized 
[12:53] <darksydephil> im here now 

[12:53] <darksydephil> sorry a bulb blew out in the kitchen so i replaced it quickly 
[14:03] <darksydephil> okay working again 
[15:15] <darksydephil> testing 

[15:16] <darksydephil> yeah now the office modem cycled when i was in the bathroom 
[15:16] <darksydephil> so trying to figure out whats going on 

[15:17] <darksydephil> well the doxxing was stuff that was already public knowledge like my cell phone number 
and home phone number, it was already public 

[15:17] <darksydephil> but i have no idea how they would have gotten my IP addresses 
[15:17] <darksydephil> at least, specifically, the office modem makes no sense 

[15:17] <darksydephil> downstairs maybe from doing shit on the web or something but no idea how they could 
have gotten the office modem's IP 

[15:17] <darksydephil> maybe they did, ill check right now 

[15:21] <darksydephil> ok all, please be patient as im looking into this, thanks 

[15:21] <darksydephil> i will still finish the game on stream, just gotta check this out first 

[15:24] <darksydephil> okay i think i know whats going on 

[15:25] <darksydephil> its actually not a ddos 

[15:25] <darksydephil> from what i can see, it was a backdoor 

[15:25] <darksydephil> and im fixing it now 

[15:44] <darksydephil> hey guys 

[15:44] <darksydephil> still working on fixing some stuff 
[15:44] <darksydephil> need to make a few more phone calls 
[15:44] <darksydephil> but ill be back soon i think, we'll see lol 

[15:44] <darksydephil> im still planning on streaming but ill let you know, please stay tuned thanks 

[15:55] <darksydephil> still working here folks 

[15:55] <darksydephil> and still need to do one more thing 

[16:01] <darksydephil> so basically this was just a huge pain in the ass today 

[16:01] <darksydephil> it wasn't a ddos, just so you guys know, someone found a backdoor into some of my 
persona stuff so i have to call around and get info changed etc 
[16:01] <darksydephil> personal, not persona lol 

[16:02] <darksydephil> the great news is that NONE of the websites ever show full payment data etc. so nobody 

got a hold of my bank accounts or anything thank god 

[16:02] <darksydephil> very happy they have that level of security 




[16:04] <darksydephil> literally no personal info that wasn't already public was made public, so its not really a 
doxxing. but they did get access to a few of my accounts which im fixing right now 
[16:05] <darksydephil> i mean, my address, phone numbers, etc were already all public 
[16:05] <darksydephil> im working on it 

[16:06] <darksydephil> trying to confirm the important stuff wasn't fucked with 
[16:06] <darksydephil> at the very least, my modems shouldnt' be resetting anymore 
[16:06] <darksydephil> my bank wasn’t tied to the info that this person(s) had to get into the accounts 
[16:06] <darksydephil> its basically just old shit i've had for years and never bothered updating passwords adn 
the like for 

[16:07] <darksydephil> two years ago i had a scare with one of my email passwords so i changed ALL my email 
passwords, twitch, youtube, patreon etc. so all of those have been different for years, but there was an old 
password floating around that still worked for a few things 

[16:08] <darksydephil> id actually changed a few things over the last few days becuase i knew this was going 
on, but id forgotten a few i guess 

[16:10] <darksydephil> yeah teh good news is, websites don't display full account info, only like, the last four 
digits 

[16:10] <darksydephil> okay im not going to wait on hold for more than one more minute with Comcast lolol 
they fucking suck sometimes 

[16:11] <darksydephil> i already got the issue resolved with them 

[16:11] <darksydephil> they cant fuck with my emails, because ive got access to all of them and they have 

nothing to do with this old password 

[16:12] <darksydephil> they didn’t guess my old password 

[16:13] <darksydephil> there was site dump of info on kiwifarms the other day for forum accounts on random 
websites and they got mine from some website i guess i randomly registered for ages ago 
[16:13] <darksydephil> i stupidly must have used the same password for this random website lol 
[16:14] <darksydephil> okay i have two more places to call, then we can resume, good thing we’re at the end of 
hte game lol 

[16:20] <darksydephil> yeah see they're trying right now lol 

[16:20] <darksydephil> they're trying to log into my google and yahoo accounts be im getting the two step 
verification messages 

[16:20] <darksydephil> luckily i already set them up 

[16:21] <darksydephil> set them up for the two step verification, as in, if you dont have access to multiple 

accounts and devices you can’t change the password or access anything 

[16:32] <darksydephil> okay almost done 

[16:32] <darksydephil> just got one more major call to make 

[16:32] <darksydephil> everything else is just minor shit they're getting 

[16:32] <darksydephil> i think i only have like 30 minutes left 

[16:32] <darksydephil> in the game that is 

[16:34] <darksydephil> literally all the stuff with this old password is OLD. as in, pre-youtube or just when i 
started really, but i made the mistake of setting up some stuff with that password when i moved out here because 
i was being lazy 

[16:34] <darksydephil> so that's what they fucked with 
[16:43] <darksydephil> okay ONE MORE CALL 
[16:43] <darksydephil> then we should be good to go 
[16:55] <darksydephil> no im going to play in just a sec 

[16:55] <darksydephil> just confirming the important stuff is now fine, and it looks like it is 
[16:55] <darksydephil> i woul dhave been back over 30 mins ago if Comcast wasn't stupid 
[16:55] <darksydephil> and had me on hold forever 

[16:57] <darksydephil> theres one more thing im trying to fix but i can’t for the life of me find the place to 
change the password lol 

[16:59] <darksydephil> okay, i think im good to go 
[16:59] <darksydephil> holy shit 



[17:02] <darksydephil> okay 

[17:02] <darksydephil> stream restarting now 

[17:04] <darksydephil> ok im gonna take a piss and then we can resume, ill explain what happened 
[17:43] <darksydephil> why would second stream be cancelled? I never said anything about that. 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170821-02 SONIC MANIA 6TH.LOG 

[19:30] <darksydephil> okay 
[19:30] <darksydephil> hello everyone 
[19:30] <darksydephil> huh? 

[19:30] <darksydephil> english please? lol 

[19:30] <darksydephil> brb setting up the agents vids with thumbnails 

[19:32] <darksydephil> oh they're trying, they keep trying to break into my twitter, twitch and youtube accounts 
but they can't 

[19:32] <darksydephil> those accounts have nothing to do with the old password they got 
[19:33] <darksydephil> there was no hacking 

[19:34] <darksydephil> it was a password dump from a super old forum, a PC game i played before i ever did 
youtube vids 

[19:35] <darksydephil> yeah i guess it was lord of the rings online 

[19:35] <darksydephil> a game i bought, installed on my pc, and never worked 

[19:35] <darksydephil> i registered for the forums to try and get help, got none, uninstalled it and never played it 
[19:35] <darksydephil> so i guess those forums got hacked and there was a password dump, and just by bad 
luck, i’d stupidly registered there with a password that over the years id used for a ton of shit 
[19:36] <darksydephil> its all good now, but of course i assume trolls will now be pretending like i have 
accounts to gay websites and shit lol 

[19:36] <darksydephil> i can just imagine the stuff they'll say they "logged into" with my password 
[19:36] <darksydephil> so they can circle jerk each other for ages i guess 
[19:37] <darksydephil> anyway, i got agents done so time to set up the stream 

[19:37] <darksydephil> viking apparently they already are making fake amazon wish lists and shit, which is 

hilarious be ive never made one of those so it's obviously bogus 

[19:37] <darksydephil> they'll probably put dildos and blow up dolls on it 

[19:38] <darksydephil> yes TooOldForGaming but i have the older ps4 controllers 

[19:38] <darksydephil> which dont work with usb mode 

[19:39] <darksydephil> so thats not gonna happen 

[19:39] <darksydephil> it does? someone told me it doesn't 

[19:39] <darksydephil> that only the ps4 controllers with the newer style gray buttons, not the older controllers 

with full black buttons, will work with it 

[19:39] <darksydephil> a firmware issue or something 

[19:40] <darksydephil> oh okay 

[19:41] <darksydephil> crap i need to buy uncharted tonight, totally forgot to preorder it but i dont think it came 
with anything anyway 

[19:41] <darksydephil> let me look now actualy 
[19:43] <darksydephil> youch its 50 gigs in size haha 

[19:43] <darksydephil> hopefully uncharted is long but ive heard its not, only like 6-8 hours 
[19:45] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working folks? 

[19:45] <darksydephil> my tv doesn't have those modes fyi 
[19:47] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet that w'er elive

[12:13] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:15] <darksydephil> i just signed up but i never get into these things 





[12:16] <darksydephil> anyone playing Uncharted? it any god? 

[12:16] <darksydephil> thanks jack! 

[12:17] <darksydephil> darksydephil@hotmail.com of course 
[12:18] <darksydephil> i doubt the beta will 

[12:18] <darksydephil> i seriously hope the game isn't EXACTLY like guilty gear 

[12:18] <darksydephil> because i alreayd know, that fighting system is ridiculously complicated 

[12:18] <darksydephil> far more fun to watch than to play really 

[12:18] <darksydephil> like i actually enjoy watching high level guilty gear gameplay but i hate playtin git 
[12:22] <darksydephil> its probably gonna flop, but ill play it for the story and first week of online play 
[12:24] <darksydephil> wow uncharted theme has nice atmosphering sound 
[12:24] <darksydephil> should be a fun prestream lol 
[12:24] <darksydephil> btw stream going live in a sec 

[12:25] <darksydephil> so many people are butthurt about my mayweather-mcgregor tweet last night its 
hilarious, when they look in the mirror and see what sheep they are, the self awareness must really hurt haha 
[12:27] <darksydephil> LOL fast food ads? 

[12:27] <darksydephil> if you spend 100 dollars for a scripted/fake/meaningless event thinking it's real, you are a 

complete moron 

[12:28] <darksydephil> brb 

[12:33] <darksydephil> there we go 

[12:33] <darksydephil> luckily the idiots chimed in early 

[12:33] <darksydephil> okay stream working? 

[12:33] <darksydephil> there is audio 

[12:34] <darksydephil> listen to it, its running water 

[12:34] <darksydephil> well, a waterfall 

[12:34] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:37] <darksydephil> the entire thing from start to finish was scripted, recorded and sold, how on EARTH you 
could be ignorant enough to think that mayweather-mcgregor is real, meaningful and worth money to see is just 
beyond me. but that's just me i guess, because i dont buy into hype

[19:33] <darksydephil> the bird is in here with me! say hello, Petey! 

[19:35] <darksydephil> ok top cheer from 1st stream removed 
[19:35] <darksydephil> daigo parry was street fighter 3 third strike 

[19:36] <darksydephil> nothing Drilbit777 , i always remove it when i start a new stream so it gives viewers of 

the new stream a chance to make top cheer, it always resets 

[19:37] <darksydephil> oh are they? i haven’t checked in like a week

- #DARKSYDEPHIL 20170824-01 ASK THE KING 66.LOG 
[13:02] <darksydephil> hey folks 

[13:02] <darksydephil> FYI ask the king starts at 2pm now, ill update the schedule 
[13:19] <darksydephil> got some good questions for today's show 

[13:21] <darksydephil> Wow this is episode 67 of Ask the King. Show has been running forever 

[13:23] <darksydephil> by the way, you know how people false report me every day on here? i had a convo with 

twitch this week about bits and what can/cannot be said on streams, it was really interesting actually 

[13:24] <darksydephil> theres nothing wrong with asking people who watch your free content daily for support, 

you dummy 

[13:25] <darksydephil> so the situation is totally one of legality, bits legally cannot be referred to as currency, so 
referencing them as such is against the rules 

[13:26] <darksydephil> so for example, a streamer can say "if you like this stream and are getting hype, feel free 
to cheer!" or something like that, but a streamer cannot in any way reference bits being some kind of currency, or 
allude to it 

[13:26] <darksydephil> i guess right now twitch is treating bits as GOODS, not currency, and therefore if they 
were currency they'd be classified differently and things would change legally for them 
[13:26] <darksydephil> so thats why they have the restriction 

[13:27] <darksydephil> its quite bizarre, it has nothing whatsoever to do with "ebegging" at all, in fact, there's 


[19:32] 

[19:33] 

[19:33] 

[19:43] 

[19:47] 

[19:47] 

[19:47] 

[19:47] 

[19:48] 

[19:48] 

[19:48] 

[19:48] 

[19:49] 






nothign against "ebegging" in the TOS and it's allowed, you can ask for subs and tips nonstop lol 
[13:28] <darksydephil> a streamer could literally sit on stream for 5 hours yelling "SEND ME MONEY!" and 
it'd be allowed, but if they said "SEND ME BITS SO I CAN BUY SOMETHING" it's a violation of the terms of 
service 

[13:28] <darksydephil> really weird and vague, i agree 

[13:29] <darksydephil> so moving forward as long as i never reference bits as currency, im fine, i can say 
whatever i want about subs and tips with no worries, it was a really enlightening convo 
[13:29] <darksydephil> yeah im rereading the email now 
[13:29] <darksydephil> so get this 

[13:30] <darksydephil> you can say "thanks for the 1000 bit cheer" but you can't say "thanks for the $10 cheer" 
[13:30] <darksydephil> and you can set bits as a trigger for things, like thank-you shout outs or on-screen 
pop-ups. but you cannot have bits as a trigger for monetary things, like "if i raise 10000 bits, ill buy a new 
microphone!" 

[13:31] <darksydephil> so thats why i haven't ever gotten into trouble for anything on stream, because i'm not 

doing that kind of thing, just have to be careful not to slip up and say something incorrectly and im good 

[13:31] <darksydephil> and i have to give twitch credit, they reached out to me be of the mass false reporting to 

talk to me about it be they actually wanted to protect me. tell me if youtube would do that? lol 

[13:45] <darksydephil> okay stream will be going live shortly 

[13:45] <darksydephil> just setting up stuff 

[13:46] <darksydephil> test 

[13:47] <darksydephil> can you guys see this? 

[13:47] <darksydephil> lol 

[13:47] <darksydephil> no, im testing stream chat on te laptop, it wasn't working at first 

[15:25] <darksydephil> so yeah, the internet issues are defeinitely on comcast's end. both of my lines went down 
and then right back up, totally different from a ddos attack

[12:55] <darksydephil> if spambots tried to spam links they'd all be instantly banned lol 
[13:54] <darksydephil> im messing with stuff 
[13:54] <darksydephil> btw its definitely an attack 
[13:55] <darksydephil> i have the logs to prove it 

[13:55] <darksydephil> i may be able to stop it with stronger firewall settings 

[13:55] <darksydephil> but looks like i have to get a new IP again, sigh 

[13:59] <darksydephil> okay so i upped security settings and going to restart the modem 

[13:59] <darksydephil> if that doesn't work, which it probably wont, there’s nothing i can do until Comcast can 

come out here and get me a new modem 

[13:59] <darksydephil> brb 

[14:09] <darksydephil> test 

[14:09] <darksydephil> okay, so i seriously doubt this solved anything but im going to restart the stream in a 
minute or two here 

[14:13] <darksydephil> so i dont even know if the stream will work with these new firewall settings lol 
[14:14] <darksydephil> yup i was right, i can't stream with the strongest firewall settings

[12:32] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:32] <darksydephil> as fast as scarface? i played that until the end, you dunce 
[12:32] <darksydephil> what a stupid thing to say lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> if you weren't here for it, you shouldn't talk shit about it, stupid 
[12:41] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:42] <darksydephil> okay time to tweet that we're live 
[12:44] <darksydephil> the game is good 
[12:44] <darksydephil> i am not 

[12:44] <darksydephil> its frustrating my aim is so damn off 
[12:44] <darksydephil> but thats what i have to get better at 
[12:44] <darksydephil> its pretty blatant what the problem is lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> thats because destiny 2 players suck at competitive gameplay and that game is super easy 
to play

[12:20] <darksydephil> wassap all 

[12:22] <darksydephil> well it wasn’t me, im not live yet lol 

[12:22] <darksydephil> FYI folks, trying something out today, may not work so if the stream doesn't work at 
first ill tweak it and then we’ll get started 

[12:27] <darksydephil> wassap kekon, everything fine with you and Hurricane Harvey? it missed? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> okay im gonna turn on the stream, lets see if it works as usual 

[12:30] <darksydephil> actually hold up 

[12:30] <darksydephil> gonna try something else first 

[12:33] <darksydephil> yeah im here 

[12:33] <darksydephil> about to start actually 

[12:41] <darksydephil> okay starting up the stream now 

[12:41] <darksydephil> lets see if it works 

[12:42] <darksydephil> its the fastest internet here reggarz, everything else is ULTRA slow and capped for data 
[12:42] <darksydephil> i have to pay what i pay or i can’t do this as a job 

[12:43] <darksydephil> dspfandood : because then you'd have wireless shit interfering with the streaming and 
uploading etc 

[12:44] <darksydephil> i would go over it in like, less than 2 weeks 





[12:44] <darksydephil> and then my bill would be like $600 with overages 

[12:45] <darksydephil> Major Nelson lives here, and when Comcast turned on the data caps, he went over his 

data limit in one week lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> stream working folks? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay great, ill tweet that we’re live, looks like we’ll be fine for the stream 
[12:51] <darksydephil> okay prestream startign in a minute, almost set here 

[12:51] <darksydephil> aes04111 id say this game is worth 20 bucks, nothing more, so if it's still more than that, 
hell no 

[12:52] <darksydephil> it's a bad port of an amazing game, but the only current version anyone plays on 
consoles, so its a tradeoff of good and bad 

[12:53] <darksydephil> it'd be Nice if Nintendo would explain if Mario + Rabbids will be available at 9pm PDT 

or later digitally, but you know, NINTENDO 

[12:53] <darksydephil> Mario + Rabbids isn't first party 

[12:53] <darksydephil> it's made by Ubisoft

[12:14] <darksydephil> Prince GK tha nk s for the pledge! FYI, to avoid being re-charged $50 on the 1st, you'll 
want to lower your pledge to a different recurring amount or remove it entirely 

[12:15] <darksydephil> and yes, that will make the public-facing total reduce on my patreon page but ill 
remember that we're about $165 away from hitting the goal or so 

[12:16] <darksydephil> yeah kekon, you are an awesome viewer and supporter, do not overextend yourself! 
[12:16] <darksydephil> by the way 

[12:17] <darksydephil> Sonic Mania review on KOGaming demonetized in 5 minutes when privated, but upped 

to THEKINGOFHATEVLOGS? still fine, no demonetization after being live 12+ hours 

[12:17] <darksydephil> so KOGaming is officially dead thanks to youtube 

[12:17] <darksydephil> looks like old school reviews are going back on the vlogging channel 

[12:17] <darksydephil> and that means my year-end series go back on DSPGaming lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> that was a quick change 

[12:18] <darksydephil> yeah 

[12:18] <darksydephil> i hate to say it, but THANK GOD i didn’t invest more time into KOGaming than i did. 

imagine if i went full on gung-ho into it 

[12:18] <darksydephil> and then this happened 

[12:18] <darksydephil> all that work for fucking nothing

[12:26] <darksydephil> Prince GK so basically exactly as i did the reviews last night, but stream them? its a 
possibility

[19:32] <darksydephil> hmm 
[19:32] <darksydephil> so

[19:34] <darksydephil> well apologies all, im running behind setting up here, filmed a dsp tries it today but htere 
was tons of traffic so i just finished downstairs, didnt even get to water my darn plants 
[19:37] <darksydephil> im getting the rabbids vids finished up now 
[19:37] <darksydephil> then ill start the stream 

[19:38] <darksydephil> btw, new dsp tries it will be hilarious, talk about doing something wrong, they totally 
botched my order 

[19:45] <darksydephil> stream working now? 

[19:45] <darksydephil> people were cheering to the end of the stream earlier 
[19:45] <darksydephil> so i dunno if they fed up bits lol 
[19:46] <darksydephil> seems to be a really random issue 

[19:47] <darksydephil> but hey guys, guess what? tipping still works! dspHinm lol 

[19:48] <darksydephil> im pretty sure there's no zombie test, yeah lol 

[19:50] <darksydephil> he’d have a flurry of slow punches called the Multiple Choice 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170831-01 LISBTS EP1.LOG

[12:27] <darksydephil> nice try lol 
[12:29] <darksydephil> it's really at $957 

[12:29] <darksydephil> someone pledged $50 and then withdrew the pledge so i twouldn’t renew on the 1st 







[12:29] <darksydephil> so thats what, $160 away? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> its actually impossible to tell until after everything processes on the 1st 
[12:30] <darksydephil> then i can see what actually is in the account and what didnt process 
[12:31] <darksydephil> yeah, could we stop with the shitposting today, it would be nice

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170831-02 YAKUZA KIWAMI 3RD.LOG 

[19:28] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:28] <darksydephil> good, starting shortly 

[19:29] <darksydephil> yeah trying the auto remove 

[19:29] <darksydephil> sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt, but it always sounds like shit 
[19:29] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:30] <darksydephil> one person pledged $5 today, so we're stilll around $160 short 
[19:30] <darksydephil> i really dont think its gonna happen lol 

[19:32] <darksydephil> i dunno yet. the friday before is the day with THREE new releases 

[19:33] <darksydephil> so its not liek theres nothing to do and i wont be busy regardless 

[19:33] <darksydephil> i may re-run this as the goal for September though, be i KNOW people love this event. 

have no idea what happened this month besides mass slander, as usual 

[19:33] <darksydephil> um its AC origns, wolfenstein and mario odyssey 

[19:33] <darksydephil> thats an insane day 

[19:35] <darksydephil> crashes? yeah the game crapped out twice 

[19:35] <darksydephil> once it froze my entire ps4 

[19:35] <darksydephil> what a great game haha 

[19:37] <darksydephil> $14, fuck that shit 

[19:37] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i never played tekken bowling but ive played the volleyball game 
[19:39] <darksydephil> i think it was tekken 2 or 3 
[19:40] <darksydephil> playstation version 

[19:41] <darksydephil> Dradogs2 : because the only thing left to do in the game was learn new characters and 
play it competitively, and i didnt really have any desire to do that 

[19:41] <darksydephil> the game is great, but i just didnt want to dedicate any more time to it 
[19:41] <darksydephil> Xcom 3? you mean Mario + Rabbids? 

[19:42] <darksydephil> stream is just starting 
[19:42] <darksydephil> speaking of which 
[19:42] <darksydephil> is it working? 

[19:42] <darksydephil> okay cool, ill tweet it out and then we can chat a bit 
[20:03] <darksydephil> yes im recording, relax all 
[20:03] <darksydephil> thanks for looking out though 

[22:03] <darksydephil> flyeaglesfly: there are 3 major new releases coming out 3 days before halloween: ac 
origins, wolfenstein and mario odyssey 

[22:03] <darksydephil> doing the halloween event would actually take away from playing new releases, i.e. it 
wouldn't be "making me a ton of money" like you're thinking 

[22:03] <darksydephil> i love doing the event but it undoubtedly is going to take away from the new games 
people woudl want to still see 

[22:04] <darksydephil> thats why its a patreon goal, to celebrate hititng the funding and maybe being able to 
take a day away from the new stuff just to have some holiday fun 

[22:04] <darksydephil> but hey, if people didn’t pledge, i couldn’t make them, tons of them tipped me this 
month, so they chose to contribute in that way instead i guess 
[22:09] <darksydephil> It’s off by around $165 

[22:09] <darksydephil> very doable, but people preferred to be drama queens about it this month lol. oh well
