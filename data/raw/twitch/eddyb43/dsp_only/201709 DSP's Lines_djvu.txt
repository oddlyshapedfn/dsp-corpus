-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170902-01 CODWWII BETA 3RD.LOG 

[12:15] <darksydephil> what a riveting discussion from who children 

[12:15] <darksydephil> two that is 

[12:15] <darksydephil> hello jack 

[12:15] <darksydephil> hello gamemaster 

[12:15] <darksydephil> yes 

[12:15] <darksydephil> apparently theres more new stuff in the beta now 

[12:20] <darksydephil> jackwhite202 nope, nothign yet unless it went to my spam filter 

[12:22] <darksydephil> has anything at all happened at PAX? I've been looking for news and can't find anything, 
yet again lol. Kind of not really sad that I never go 
[12:24] <darksydephil> yeah lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> its almost kidn of sad, i follow a bunch of people in the industry and all they're tweeting 

about all weekend is PAX, as if it's important, yet not a single tweet has covered anything new or interesting, its 

just them going through the motions to try and hype a non event 

[12:25] <darksydephil> and no, nobody has offered to donate destiny 2 which sucks 

[12:25] <darksydephil> be i really could use the help right now 

[12:26] <darksydephil> of course it is, it's Bungie, the laziest game dev on earth lol 

[12:26] <darksydephil> Halo 3, their biggest flagship game ever, wasn’t even 720p on the xbox 360 

[12:26] <darksydephil> do the bare minimum for maximum profits 

[12:36] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:36] <darksydephil> stream working folks? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i would do the fun destiny stuff if it didn't require 60 hours of grinding through boring 
crap and if peopel actually wanted to play it with me 

[12:39] <darksydephil> thats the problem, you can’t hide the golden nugget at the end of a 60 hour rainbow of shit 
[12:40] <darksydephil> destiny is NOT an MMO 
[12:40] <darksydephil> it never was 

[12:40] <darksydephil> the poll starts tomorrow dspfandood 
[12:40] <darksydephil> um, none of htat is what an mmo is 

[12:41] <darksydephil> massively multiplayer online, it's not massively multiplayer in any sense of the word 

[12:41] <darksydephil> 6 man is not massively multipalyer 

[12:41] <darksydephil> sorry, it just isnt. thats a fact 

[12:41] <darksydephil> it's not an mmo 

[12:41] <darksydephil> its an online co-op looter shooter 

[12:42] <darksydephil> just because Bungie markets it as an MMO and pays a shitton of money to call it that 
doesn't make it one, unless you're that gullible to believe everything an advertisement tells you. if that's the case 
you probably believe Destiny 1 "changed gaming forever" too 

[12:43] <darksydephil> its not massive in any sense, the game world, the amount of players, neither are massive, 
sorry, facts are facts 





[12:44] <darksydephil> my god, you are gullible lol 

[12:45] <darksydephil> by your definition, Overwatch is an MMO. it is not. 

[12:46] <darksydephil> MY definition? the first M stands for massive, i didn’t make that up lol 

[12:46] <darksydephil> the point of an MMO is supposed to be mass interaction on a global scale, to the point 

that there are social/cultural interactions because of the huge player base. There are 6 players max in Destiny, it 

is not an MMO, facts are facts 

[12:47] <darksydephil> they're not MY RULES LOL 

[12:47] <darksydephil> these have been existing rules since the 1990s 

[12:47] <darksydephil> you're showing your massive ignorance now and im done arguing with someone who is 
misinformed lol 

[12:57] <darksydephil> stupid baby got banned

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170903-01 ULTRA SL2 SWITCH 15TH.LOG 

[12:25] <darksydephil> wow 

[12:25] <darksydephil> goldencolts cheering at 9am, and someone sent me a $20 tip this morning too 
[12:27] <darksydephil> also i just walked into this office and it was 85 degrees, ugh 
[12:28] <darksydephil> its mvc3 without the characters you actually like 
[12:28] <darksydephil> and mvc3 played like shit 

[12:32] <darksydephil> yeah, destiny 2 doesn't come out until Wednesday 
[12:32] <darksydephil> because bungie is "different" 

[12:32] <darksydephil> so i guess knack 2 gets a major feature on tuesday 
[12:33] <darksydephil> okay got the laptop set up 

[12:34] <darksydephil> well first off, it looks like the game is getting donated 
[12:34] <darksydephil> second, if you dont play bad games, you cant appreciate good ones 
[12:34] <darksydephil> third, if i dont play it, ill be hounded forever 
[12:35] <darksydephil> the modern day maha-raja of course 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i never said that, i didnt even know it was a Wednesday release until late last night 
[12:40] <darksydephil> they changed it to a day that games don't get released on anywhere, genius lol 
[12:42] <darksydephil> theres absolutely no reason to buy an arcade stick for the switch lol 
[12:42] <darksydephil> pokken has a pad, its what i use already, and its incredibly good 





[12:42] <darksydephil> the controller doesn't drop the inputs, the game does 
[12:42] <darksydephil> because its a poorly designed piece of shit 
[12:43] <darksydephil> okay stream working everyone? 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:47] <darksydephil> wii and wii u had dashboard music 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170904-01 MARIO+RABBIDS 4TH.LOG 

[12:37] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:38] <darksydephil> sorry for the delay, i was having some crazy tech difficulties here with the switch and 
my tv 

[12:38] <darksydephil> the tv was going nuts, acting as if i were pushing random buttons on its controller for 
about 15 minutes 

[12:38] <darksydephil> and its the switch's fault, for some reason the switch interacts with the tv, like if i turn it 
on, the tv turns on automatically and if i turn off the tv, the switch turns itself off 

[12:38] <darksydephil> so i guess it was having some kind of nutty malfunction but it finally got settled down 

[12:44] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:44] <darksydephil> time tos tart up the stream 

[12:48] <darksydephil> stream working all? 

[12:48] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live, thanks! 

[12:51] <darksydephil> whats going on in here lol 

[12:52] <darksydephil> of course the sound is off, its the mothafuckin' switch, son. they dont pay for dashboard 
music! 


-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170904-02 YAKUZA KIWAMI 5TH.LOG 

[19:31] <darksydephil> youtube sucks lol 

[19:32] <darksydephil> alright, except that youtube stopped working during my break, so i didn’t get all the 
mario rabbids vids uploaded yet 

[19:32] <darksydephil> so ill have to do those plus the yakuza vids after this stream 
[19:33] <darksydephil> anybody else here? 

[19:34] <darksydephil> okay cool, im setting up now 

[19:36] <darksydephil> you can tell that youtube decided to revert to some old code, because old issues with 

uploading have re-emerged in the last week 

[19:37] <darksydephil> later Derich 

[19:37] <darksydephil> i guarantee you're right Deep 

[19:38] <darksydephil> someone who knows a youtube coder told me that the coder says, the website is basically 
fucked, its generations of code that previous employees made all layered on top of each other and nobody can 
even read it anymore, just try to add to or tweak it 
[19:39] <darksydephil> i dont think they really could 

[19:39] <darksydephil> they're not smart enough, plus it would mean site downtime 
[19:40] <darksydephil> okay, time to start the stream finally 
[19:41] <darksydephil> you know whats funny 
[19:41] <darksydephil> i tried the new layout 6 months ago 

[19:41] <darksydephil> they did a limited test runa nd you could try it and revert back etc 
[19:42] <darksydephil> when i tried it, those morons didn’t even have a block button. THEY HAD DELETED 
THE ABILITY TO BLOCK PEOPLE WHO TROLL YOU. that’s how fucking out of touch youtube is. i had to 
tell them in my feedback form that they're idiots 

[19:42] <darksydephil> yeah thats the true sign of bad management, ask your customers for feedback, 
overwhelmingly get told something, and just ignore it 
[19:43] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> brb gonna use the bathroom before we start 
[19:47] <darksydephil> ok stream working folks? 

[19:47] <darksydephil> ok ill teet that we’re live 





[19:49] <darksydephil> okay just tweeted

[12:51] <darksydephil> it looks quite apocalyptic here 

[12:52] <darksydephil> is it from a wildfire? i have no idea, ive been getting stuff set up etc and not following 
the news 

[12:53] <darksydephil> its pretty crazy, you can tell the sun is out but the sky is just a haze 
[12:54] <darksydephil> and yeah i heard about the cryptocurrency crashing, oh well. 

[12:54] <darksydephil> ok let me blow my nose and then we’ll start 
[16:34] <darksydephil> hey guys, enough with teh sex talk 
[16:34] <darksydephil> not appropriate 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170905-02 MARIO+RABBIDS 5TH.LOG 

[19:28] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:32] <darksydephil> cool 

[19:32] <darksydephil> glad you're here 

[19:32] <darksydephil> i think we should meet around 11:45am PDT to make the party and test voice chat 
[19:32] <darksydephil> if i sound like shit we’ll do the discord route 

[19:33] <darksydephil> okay, its you me mizorelover and maybe zahvone, he said he wanted to join and i said 
okay but then i didnt hear back lol 

[19:36] <darksydephil> whoa thanks pwnage for the tip? he just tipped even though im not live yet lol 
[19:37] <darksydephil> im abou tto be, let me get the switch booted 
[19:37] <darksydephil> no but it was $15, still very generous 

[19:38] <darksydephil> lol well of course, that would help tremendously with my bills 

[19:38] <darksydephil> i have 5 more days to go before i get my Curse payment so im pretty nervous, i know the 
bank account is very low 

[19:39] <darksydephil> hey, twitch has done nothing wrong 

[19:40] <darksydephil> twitch has been very good to me, i mean, they even WROTE ME to talk about what 
is/isn’t allowed to be said on streams be of so many false reports, they cared enough about me to go out of their 
way to protect me 

[19:40] <darksydephil> that means a lot to me, considering the situation im in financially 

[19:41] <darksydephil> okay just gotta get muxy popups set up and we can start mario + rabbids 

[19:41] <darksydephil> i will say this, miraculously in the 10 months ive come back to twitch, they've constantly 

IMPROVED, most of my criticisms have been addressed fairly 

[19:41] <darksydephil> oh is it KingJezal ? i havent had a chance to look ina day 

[19:43] <darksydephil> im not even sure what you mean lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> i talk to tons of people on a daily basis 

[19:44] <darksydephil> i dont have time for in person friends, im constantly working, you realize i haven't had a 
day off since my time off in july, right? except for one day i was sick 

[19:45] <darksydephil> this is my life and has been for quite a long time before i moved here, then it got better 
for 3 years living with my ex, but now its back to square one really 

[19:45] <darksydephil> i actually have to take a "day off' from streaming next week to do personal stuff, like 

powerwashing my driveway which was supposed to be done by last month but i had no time for it 

[19:46] <darksydephil> i cant let it stay dirty, it would be a violation of the rules here 

[19:46] <darksydephil> and they want to repair some cracks in it, which they wont until its clean 

[19:47] <darksydephil> theres tons of behidn the scenes stuff like that i dont talk about, its why my life is so 

stressful now. i dont have someone to split responsibilities with 

[19:47] <darksydephil> my neighbor lives alone, but shes retired, no work to worry bout so she can deal with 





shit like that daily and have no problems, me, im constantly busy 
[19:48] <darksydephil> wel thats the thing 

[19:48] <darksydephil> a day off from me is a day away from streaming, but that just means im using the time to 
do other shit that needs to get done, i haven’t had a legit "day off in...fuck, i dont even remember, probably a 
year ago 

[19:49] <darksydephil> when was the staycation? July 2016. thats the last time of I had lol. which is why i love it 
when morons come in here and say i dont work 
[19:49] <darksydephil> anyway, is the stream working? 

[19:49] <darksydephil> I still have to buy Destiny 2, i had THREE offers of it being donated and they all fell 
through 

[19:50] <darksydephil> okay great 

[19:50] <darksydephil> let me tweet that we’re live and then we can chat 

[19:52] <darksydephil> how can i get a roomie when i have no time to clean out the spare room? its still full of 
shit 

[19:52] <darksydephil> why would a roomate pay rent to then have to clean shit out? lol. thats NOT how it works 
[19:54] <darksydephil> right now i just have to keep busting my ass working to pay the bills, tahts all i have time 
for 

[19:54] <darksydephil> thankfully my job is fun. imagine if it wasn't 
[22:10] <darksydephil> hey kekon 

[22:10] <darksydephil> can you meet up at 11:45 am PDT tomororw to make the party and test my audio quality? 
[22:11] <darksydephil> what time are you out? 

[22:11] <darksydephil> stream starts at 12:30 and i need to have us set up before we can start onviously 
[22:11] <darksydephil> obviously 

[22:12] <darksydephil> then maybe ill announce we're starting at 1pm instead 
[22:12] <darksydephil> just so we have time 

[22:13] <darksydephil> i know i usually dont start until like 1:30 with the prestream but the point is, we have to 
get set up before we reach that point lol 

[22:14] <darksydephil> okay that's what we’ll do. you get home as soon as you can, i’ll get hte lobby set up with 
mizorelover and zahvone (if zahvone is actually around) to test audio quality and you can jump in when you 
arrive, if we have to set up discord, we will at that point 
[22:16] <darksydephil> sounds good 

[22:16] <darksydephil> i hope i dont sound like ass but...i know this headset sucks 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170906-01 DESTINY 2 1ST.LOG 

[12:10] <darksydephil> sup zahvone 

[12:11] <darksydephil> are you going to join us today? 

[12:11] <darksydephil> im going to set up now, i know that you hav eto play the stupid ass intro mission first 
and thats over 30 minutes, so whenever thats over by, i hope to finish that by like 1:30-2pm 
[12:12] <darksydephil> well thats the problem, kekon is joining the team but he couldn’t be here until after 12:30 
anyway, which was fine since i had to play the intro mission solo 

[12:12] <darksydephil> but now mizorelover's internet has completely crapped out and he's getting his place 
rewired, its like, every piece of bad luck possible, and then factor in i got about 3.5 hours sleep last night 
[12:13] <darksydephil> Zahvone better yet, just come in the chat here and let us know 
[12:13] <darksydephil> since ill be reading it 
[12:13] <darksydephil> yeah np 

[12:13] <darksydephil> looks like this playtrhough will be COMPLETELY on the fly haha 
[12:13] <darksydephil> oh well 

[12:14] <darksydephil> okay so i guess let me swap to my astro a40 headphones so if i need to use voice chat, i 
can. even though it'll sound like shit for my partners 

[12:16] <darksydephil> yeah my turtle beach worked GREAT, sound was outstanding in the mic, but it sstopped 
fucking working altogether for no reason at all 

[12:17] <darksydephil> yeah i seriously need a new set of headphones/mic for consoles but ....i cant afford it 




[12:17] <darksydephil> my trittons, turtle beach and astros are all on their last legs 
[12:20] <darksydephil> i had a snowball 
[12:20] <darksydephil> it broke lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> everything i buy breaks be i use it so much, luckily my studio mic is outstanding quality 
and hasnt 

[12:20] <darksydephil> snowball was the first mic i ever used for direct capture actually 
[12:22] <darksydephil> okay truth be told 

[12:22] <darksydephil> these astros sound better than my turtle beach now. i think the turtle beach completely 
crapped out 

[12:22] <darksydephil> only thing is, they suck for bass so theres like, NONE lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> okay so i think im going to get set up and start, play all the intro shit which should take 
30-40 minutes, then see who's available to coop 

[12:24] <darksydephil> because no reason to wait around and then have to play the solo shit anyway 
[12:37] <darksydephil> okay

their coding for some reason, idiots 

[19:34] <darksydephil> lol let me guess, server capacity error 
[19:34] <darksydephil> not surprising since its later now 
[19:35] <darksydephil> what the fuck 
[19:35] <darksydephil> that doesnt sound so good 

[19:35] <darksydephil> it sounds like the actual login server is down completely

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170907-01 DESTINY 2 2ND.LOG 

[12:14] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:14] <darksydephil> so do we want to mess with the new extensions today? apparently i can add both a 

virtual pet and minigame to my twitch channel page lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> as silly as that sounds 

[12:15] <darksydephil> i have no idea since its brand new 

[12:17] <darksydephil> i just turned on the kappa pet lol 

[12:18] <darksydephil> and now i turned on the minigame Streamlegends 

[12:19] <darksydephil> the fact that they dont interfere at ALL with the actual streams is pretty smart 
[12:19] <darksydephil> i guess the pet doesn't work until i start streaming 
[12:20] <darksydephil> actually 
[12:20] <darksydephil> i dont think the pet works lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> it keeps telling me to log in with twitch, which i do, but it doesn’t update 
[12:21] <darksydephil> yeah the pet seems broken, thats a shame 
[12:22] <darksydephil> we’ll see i guess 

[12:22] <darksydephil> anyway dr zombius made destiny animations, let me add them now quick 
[12:25] <darksydephil> Into The Vrains this isn’t really news lol 
[12:26] <darksydephil> this is common sense to anyone with a brain 
[12:26] <darksydephil> oh yeah, subs are now half price until October 2nd 

[12:26] <darksydephil> and if you cheer with bits, if you include #charity with teh cheer, supposedly twitch 

donates to charity 

[12:27] <darksydephil> just an fyi 

[12:27] <darksydephil> i have no idea if i actually get the bits then lol 
[12:30] <darksydephil> okay stream coming up! 

[12:31] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab drinks 

[12:38] <darksydephil> yeah looks like the Kappa pet extension is broken at launch lol 
[12:38] <darksydephil> epic fail on their part 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay let me head to the loveseat and we can start prestream 
[12:41] <darksydephil> i think the cheer leaderboard thing is quite useful 

[12:41] <darksydephil> like at the end of every stream i can now shout ou tto the top 5 cheerers for the day 
[12:41] <darksydephil> i have no idea how the game works, and the kappa pet is broken lol 
[12:42] <darksydephil> hello kekon 

[12:42] <darksydephil> we’ll get the party set up after prestream 
[12:42] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:42] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea if/how the #charity cheer even works 
[12:43] <darksydephil> its a rumor OaksFinMojo but we have no idea 




[12:43] <darksydephil> i didnt get anything from twitch about it 
[12:43] <darksydephil> i do give to charity when i can afford it 
[12:44] <darksydephil> no, im working all this weekend 

[12:44] <darksydephil> ive given to pet rescues, scholarship funds and cancer research before 

[12:44] <darksydephil> i just dont talk about it publicly be IMO charity should be private, and not done to brag 

about it 

[13:18] <darksydephil> almost ready guys 
[13:18] <darksydephil> one more sec!

[12:36] <darksydephil> kekon will you be around? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> cool 

[12:36] <darksydephil> bojack horsemen strongly reminds me of Californication only with less sex lol 
[12:37] <darksydephil> although he did sleep with his former child co-star who was now 30 years old in an 
episode i watched last night, pretty dark lol 

[12:37] <darksydephil> okay guys, stream working? if so ill tweet and then grab drinks

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170909-01 DESTINY 2 4TH.LOG 

[12:31] <darksydephil> hello everyone 
[12:32] <darksydephil> setting up now! 

[12:32] <darksydephil> may finish the story of destiny 2 today 
[12:32] <darksydephil> looks like i’m close to the end 
[12:33] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> he actually said "dont band me" 

[12:36] <darksydephil> my god 

[12:36] <darksydephil> what has humanity come to lol 

[12:37] <darksydephil> good luck Cress, everyone is wishing you Floridians the best 

[12:39] <darksydephil> yeah i know that MizoreLover is joining me today 

[12:39] <darksydephil> wahts weird is i haven't seen zahvone in days, since Wednesday 

[12:40] <darksydephil> yeah i figure we need somethign to break up the week from destiny 

[12:41] <darksydephil> why are you propagating a meme that's clearly for the slow minded? i mean, it just 

shows you are too 

[12:42] <darksydephil> um 

[12:42] <darksydephil> so remember those videos that got demonetized last night? 

[12:42] <darksydephil> i just checked, all but one are re-monetized and i never submitted them for review 
[12:42] <darksydephil> uuuuh 
[12:42] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay, stream working for everyone? 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[12:46] <darksydephil> damn, considering we're 9 days away and it looks like they're only raising about $3k a 
day, i dont think twitch is going to raise the entire $200k for charity 
[12:46] <darksydephil> thats a shame 




[12:46] <darksydephil> okay brb, gonna grab drinks 
[13:39] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[13:40] <darksydephil> looks like destiny 2 servers may be borked 
[13:40] <darksydephil> its not forming the fireteam properly 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170909-02 KNACK 2 4TH.LOG 

[19:31] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:34] <darksydephil> just finishing up with the destiny vids on youtube 
[19:34] <darksydephil> then we'll start the stream here 
[19:38] <darksydephil> i do not make longplays 

[19:38] <darksydephil> what i do is incredibly different from people who put out long gameplay videos and it 
only works when they're short, period. 

[19:40] <darksydephil> this has nothing to do with that at all 

[19:40] <darksydephil> it has to do with my channel getting way less ads earlier this year because my viewer 
retention percentage was low, and i was instructed to make my videos shorter to keep that percentage up, or else 
i’d get less and less ads 

[19:41] <darksydephil> i explained this in full detail earlier in the year, trust me, what im doing is what i have to 
do or else DSPGaming will go out of business 

[19:42] <darksydephil> if you're using the playlists like you should be for any long or ongoing series on youtube, 
video length is completely negligible. Problem is, it's 2017 and people STILL don’t know how to use youtube 
[19:42] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:42] <darksydephil> Nich, nobody uses restricted mode lol. nobody even knows it exists 
[19:42] <darksydephil> its not on by default 
[19:42] <darksydephil> it affects nothign 
[19:43] <darksydephil> nope 

[19:44] <darksydephil> it has nothing to do with anything, it's a worthless mode nobody uses 
[19:44] <darksydephil> any youtubers who freaked out about it this year are misinformed 
[19:44] <darksydephil> nope 

[19:44] <darksydephil> in the last month, the only videos that have been demonetized were a single part of Siren, 
and one part of Yakuza titled "grab-ass" 

[19:45] <darksydephil> i played both of them actually 

[19:45] <darksydephil> thekingofhate.com/playlists 

[19:45] <darksydephil> easiest way to find anything i've ever done 

[19:46] <darksydephil> restricted mode is some stupid unfinished project that youtube fed up and rolled out 
without every fully finishing 

[19:46] <darksydephil> its supposed to hide videos with adult content from kids, that's not at all what it actually 
does 

[19:47] <darksydephil> much like the new demonetization algorithm, it just grabs random videos and hides 
them, it makes no sense, things with sex and gore are unrestricted but kid-oriented content is 
[19:48] <darksydephil> yes. ad revenue has been up for about a week now 
[19:48] <darksydephil> not surprising, it's September 

[19:49] <darksydephil> it will never go back to "normal" because this is the new normal, after the adpocalypse 
[19:50] <darksydephil> okay, so is the stream working? 

[19:50] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet that we’re live 

[19:52] <darksydephil> bentboxer please refrain from eating the two entire pizzas during this stream, i’d prefer to 
keep all of my viewers alive and healthy 
[19:53] <darksydephil> oh shit 

[19:53] <darksydephil> i forgot to upload dsp tries it lol 
[19:53] <darksydephil> ill have to do that after the stream 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170910-01 ULTRA SF2 SWITCH 16TH.LOG 

[12:35] <darksydephil> so you got banned for your name finally? im surprised it took so long, i knew that 





wouldn't fly 

[12:36] <darksydephil> to be honest, you probably shouldn’t sub under this current name either 
[12:36] <darksydephil> be they're going to ban it again 
[12:36] <darksydephil> just make up something new that isn’t offensive man 
[12:36] <darksydephil> give it up lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> there are fights worth fighting, but keeping this name isn’t one of them lol 
[12:37] <darksydephil> yeah you've got to pick your battles in life 

[12:39] <darksydephil> what do you mean, how did i know? they were actively harming me however they could, 
regularly stirring up drama where it didn’t exist, just to give themselves something to do and retain attention 
[12:39] <darksydephil> normal people dont do that 

[12:39] <darksydephil> take a WILD GUESS who it is that jumps on USF2 every week with those insulting 
names about me? not normal fucking people lol 

[12:40] <darksydephil> SOK actively organizes the trolling around all of my online gaming, it was always them 

[12:41] <darksydephil> okay stream going live in a sec 

[12:42] <darksydephil> so he doxxes both weddings and funerals, delightful 

[12:48] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:48] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:49] <darksydephil> okay cool, ill tweet that we're live 
[12:52] <darksydephil> sure if i see you atlastelamon9 
[12:52] <darksydephil> griffin: about 35.5 years 
[16:55] <darksydephil> bethe 
[16:55] <darksydephil> last warning 
[16:55] <darksydephil> dont undo my bans 
[16:55] <darksydephil> or you'll find yourslef outside soon 
[17:00] <darksydephil> um, i didnt ban bethe 

[17:01] <darksydephil> i told him to stop unbanning people i ban which he's well known for 
[17:01] <darksydephil> and ive gotten dozens of complaints about it now 
[17:17] <darksydephil> idiot 
[17:17] <darksydephil> lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170911-01 DESTINY 2 5TH.LOG 

[12:26] <darksydephil> hello everyone! 

[12:28] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:29] <darksydephil> so i talked to Venomousfatman who was supposed to join me at some point for Destiny 
2. He was hit so harm by Irma he still doens't have power and had to find a mall in his area that did have it to 
charge all of his devices, everyone is in the same boat 
[12:29] <darksydephil> basically almost all of florida is completely offline 

[12:32] <darksydephil> kekon we'll see, Brian is definitely playing today, so ill probably have an open spot 
unless say, Zahvone appears out of hiding but he hasn’t been around since last Wednesday 
[12:34] <darksydephil> the thing that's crazy is, it's becoming apparent that with climate change, we as humans 
cannot live in the same areas we used to. Like Barbuda (spelling may be off) which is the partner island of 
Antigua had 95% of homes COMPLETELY destroyed. And they're talking about rebuilding! What the fuck, do 
you not think more hurricanes are coming? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> Aproxymate there's desire to stay where you are and then there's reality, if a volcano rose 

up under your feet you wuldn’t try to rebuild on top of the volcano 

[12:36] <darksydephil> and that's teh situation some of these people are now in 

[12:37] <darksydephil> yeah veera, even if that's how you really feel, you should probably keep it to yourself, 
not a popular line of thought 

[12:37] <darksydephil> besides, this is a gaming stream, no idea why people are talking about nukes in all 
honesty, let's all relax 

[12:38] <darksydephil> in a few moments on stream, ill go on a commentary so full of racism, it'll put Pewdiepie 
to shame! Oh wait, i'm not retarded 




[12:38] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:40] <darksydephil> so anyway, is the stream working? 

[12:40] <darksydephil> great time to tweet 

[12:48] <darksydephil> oh shit, zahvone is online 

[12:48] <darksydephil> i wonder where the hell he’s been 

[12:48] <darksydephil> well ill see if he wants to play after prestream 

[13:22] <darksydephil> so im going to see if zahvone wants to play, if not, ill invite someone else 
[13:23] <darksydephil> okay no zahvone, he has to work 

[13:24] <darksydephil> hey kekon, you still need to hit a higher light level for raids right 
[13:24] <darksydephil> ? 

[13:24] <darksydephil> be mizorelover already hit it i believe, so it makes sense to team with someone who 
needs the levels 

[13:24] <darksydephil> i could be wrong though, tring to figure it out 
[13:25] <darksydephil> yeah wow zahvone, thanks very much! 

[13:26] <darksydephil> yes 
[13:26] <darksydephil> i did i think? 

[13:26] <darksydephil> not sure, i know it popped up as a milestone 

[13:26] <darksydephil> MizoreLover do you still need to get a higher light level for raids or did you hit it 
already? 

[13:27] <darksydephil> i think they said its 260 
[13:27] <darksydephil> not positive 

[13:28] <darksydephil> zahvone when you hit 20 and grind a bit to get to power/light level 260 you can join us. 

im definitely going to do the raid this time 

[13:32] <darksydephil> okay we are setting up now 

[13:33] <darksydephil> we’re almost ready, forming fire team now

[19:29] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:29] <darksydephil> well its over tonight so 

[19:29] <darksydephil> hopefully the ending is good 

[19:29] <darksydephil> mario + rabbids? thats whats resuming 

[19:29] <darksydephil> dishonored on friday, dBZ fighter this weekend 

[19:30] <darksydephil> the stand alone expansion, death of the outsider 

[19:31] <darksydephil> im not aganst doing it, especially considering the channel that i originally played it on 
was hacked and stolen 

[19:31] <darksydephil> but i probably wont do it when it first releases considering all the other new games ill be 
playing 

[19:31] <darksydephil> because it had like 30k subs, thats why 
[19:32] <darksydephil> is the stream working folks? 

[19:34] <darksydephil> kekon im not even close to being ready for the raid 
[19:34] <darksydephil> i ended at like power level 250 today 
[19:34] <darksydephil> people are saying its level 270 

[19:34] <darksydephil> so its just gonna be MORE grinding tomorrow i gues and i have no idea if ill ever even 

have time to do the damn raid 

[19:35] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:36] <darksydephil> yes 

[19:36] <darksydephil> once its on xbox one 

[19:36] <darksydephil> for sure 

[19:37] <darksydephil> so i got my new controller 

[19:37] <darksydephil> it feels like, totally different 

[19:37] <darksydephil> every single thing, the dpad, thumbsticks and buttons all feel like they have different 
responses when you push them than the old controlelrs 

[19:38] <darksydephil> no Kekon3 , first i had 2 launch controllers, then i bought another one when the 2nd 
wave released be the thumbsticks on both the launch controllers fell apart, and ive used that one for like, 2.5 
years straight 

[19:38] <darksydephil> yup 45 on amazon and a 10 foot usb cable for like 7 
[19:38] <darksydephil> not bad 

[19:38] <darksydephil> AND im using USB mode now 
[19:38] <darksydephil> so we’ll see how that works 

[19:39] <darksydephil> yeah nothing on this controller is glossy at all, which is actually good 
[19:39] <darksydephil> blue, which was the cheapest, all other colors were like 50 or more lol 
[19:39] <darksydephil> like it matters, i woul dhave gotten doody brown if it were cheaper

so far 

[11:54] <darksydephil> yeah its cool, it'll be you me and venomousfatman today, its been cool that the teams im 
playing with have swapped around so much, lends itself to variety 

[11:56] <darksydephil> yeah the problem is, todays my last time to play destiny 2. tomorrow is the dishonored 
expansion, this weekend is the DB fighter z beta, tuesday is MvC infinite, i dunno when ill get another chance to 
play, i played it every day for a week straight and still didnt hit the damn level for raids, which is pretty insane 
when you think abou tit 

[11:58] <darksydephil> yeah, they did improve it from destiny 1, but seriously what the fuck, do they think 
people have their entire lives to dedicate to this game? the endgame content shouldn't be hidden behind a dozen 
hours of boring fucking grinding 

[11:58] <darksydephil> yeah ThatAnonyMouse honestly if it weren’t for my awesome coop partners, it probably 
would have been 1000% worse 

[11:59] <darksydephil> its fun be we’re interacting and doing stuff together 

[11:59] <darksydephil> its cool i finally got that experience out of destiny, but still, it's like.HOW MUCH 

TIME do they want me to invest 

[11:59] <darksydephil> yeah once you hit around power level 230 and do the nightfall strike, you've seen 
everything but the raid and therefore everything is just repetition 

[12:00] <darksydephil> nightfall strike is tough zahvone, took us 2 tries yesterday to do it but rewards were 
pretty good 

[12:00] <darksydephil> its basically a speedrun strike 

[12:01] <darksydephil> and enemies are immune to all but one kind of elemental damage at a time and it 
constantly rotates, its pretty chaotic 
[12:01] <darksydephil> fuck that lol 

[12:01] <darksydephil> thats impossible, you need constant communication 

[12:01] <darksydephil> like on person to grab the time rings, one to take out enemies who has the best elemental 
at that time etc 

[12:15] <darksydephil> so its Sha phone? thats how its prenounced? not like Sha vonne? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> so venomousfatman may or may not be joining us, wont know until im live and setting 
up, if not ill have an open spot 
[12:17] <darksydephil> yup 

[12:18] <darksydephil> im assume you're interested kekon? 

[12:19] <darksydephil> oh you rented it? got it 

[12:20] <darksydephil> i literally have no idea when ill have time to do the raid lol 

[12:20] <darksydephil> it could be next week, it could be never 

[12:20] <darksydephil> its 260 just to get in, recommended 270 

[12:25] <darksydephil> okay, stream going live in a sec 

[12:27] <darksydephil> by the way, weird thing 

[12:27] <darksydephil> i installed the mvc infinite theme on my ps4 

[12:27] <darksydephil> for some reason, it has no dashboard music 

[12:28] <darksydephil> so...it'll be silent in a sec 

[12:28] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea why they wouldn’t just leave the default 

[12:28] <darksydephil> if they didn’t want to use their own. its bizarre 

[12:29] <darksydephil> ill make the party right after i finish prestream 

[12:29] <darksydephil> so no rush 

[12:29] <darksydephil> got a bit lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> neither 

[12:33] <darksydephil> its the same game with a new 1-2 subclasses 
[12:33] <darksydephil> and thats it. its the same game 

[12:33] <darksydephil> theres not even a new enemy type if you played the dies in destiny 1 




[12:33] <darksydephil> same enemies, same gameplay, only difference are subclasses, you get guns faster and 
you level faster 

[12:33] <darksydephil> there, i just made the shortest review ever and its actually accurate 
[12:34] <darksydephil> destiny isn't a good game 
[12:34] <darksydephil> it’s THE game. 

[12:35] <darksydephil> it’s not a game, it’s an experience, i mean, you could be doing any of a million better 
things with your friends, but if you want to sit on your fat ass at home and do coop, its an experience. 

[12:36] <darksydephil> when I was in high school, I was busy drinking underage, getting into trouble, hanging 
with friends, messing with girls, and the like. Today, teens sit at home and play Destiny. 

[13:17] <darksydephil> omfg 

[13:17] <darksydephil> system update and the stupid ps4 didnt auto download it.... 

[13:17] <darksydephil> even though its set up to do so. i hate modern gaming 
[13:17] <darksydephil> getting it now 

[13:18] <darksydephil> endymionfanclub because i didnt know it existed? DUUUH lol 
[13:18] <darksydephil> you shouldnt be forced into moderating negative clips 
[13:18] <darksydephil> thats the point 

[13:18] <darksydephil> nobody asked for the clips system, it got forced on us, now its just more work for 
streamers 

[13:22] <darksydephil> ok we’re setting up now 
[13:22] <darksydephil> stupid update is done 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170914-02 MARIO+RABBIDS 6TH.LOG 

[19:28] <darksydephil> what the 
[19:29] <darksydephil> let me refresh 
[19:29] <darksydephil> okay 
[19:29] <darksydephil> testing? 

[19:29] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:29] <darksydephil> did the stream title just change? 

[19:30] <darksydephil> okay good 

[19:30] <darksydephil> something went wrong while i was on break lol 
[19:30] <darksydephil> hold on let me check some stuff 
[19:31] <darksydephil> no i didnt start yet 

[19:32] <darksydephil> it looks like youtube had an issue while i was on break though and thats not good be the 
destiny vids arent done 

[19:32] <darksydephil> it looks like theres 2 videos left to finish uploading 

[19:32] <darksydephil> soooo we have to wait a bit 

[19:35] <darksydephil> what are you even talking about lol 

[19:40] <darksydephil> youtube is telling me 8 minutes left 

[19:46] <darksydephil> i didnt fight a skeleton 

[19:46] <darksydephil> i think you're high or something 

[19:47] <darksydephil> i didn’t have a fan send me a letter, a fan send me a letter of their own choice 
[19:47] <darksydephil> you need better grammar sir 

[19:48] <darksydephil> that Christmas video was one of the best things ive ever done, you can watch it then and 

now and it still applies the exact same amount 

[19:50] <darksydephil> pieces of shit making poop, makes sense 

[19:50] <darksydephil> nice subs! 

[19:52] <darksydephil> they should have called it "cry for attention from a talentless idiot who can only 
half-assedly make fun of others" 

[19:52] <darksydephil> lol

[12:26] <darksydephil> hello eery one 





[12:26] <darksydephil> so....some possible bad news 

[12:26] <darksydephil> seems one of my monitors is having issues 

[12:27] <darksydephil> the left one turns on, then turns itself right off no matter what, i have to mess with it for 
like 2 minutes before it'll stay on. this is for 4 days straight now. not a good sigh 
[12:27] <darksydephil> sign 
[12:28] <darksydephil> yes 

[12:28] <darksydephil> one to monitor the capture stuff, one to do stuff on 

[12:28] <darksydephil> for example, id NEVER be able to play anything on PC nor even do a video like the one 
i did explaning the demonetized videos without 2 monitors 
[12:28] <darksydephil> its pretty essential to do this for work 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i just hope its an annoyance and not a sign the thing will blow out. i cant afford another 
one. but i do have a tv in the bedroom i could maybe swap out, but that would be pretty hilarious because its 
really big...i dunno if i could get it to fit 
[12:30] <darksydephil> then again 

[12:30] <darksydephil> i bet monitors of this size are pretty cheap now 

[12:30] <darksydephil> like under $200 

[12:30] <darksydephil> LOL shit 

[12:31] <darksydephil> over 10 years i think 

[12:31] <darksydephil> i used them for SF4 tournaments when the game launched 
[12:31] <darksydephil> so probably more like 8-9 years 
[12:31] <darksydephil> they're gaming monitors with very low response time 
[12:33] <darksydephil> okay time to start this baby up 
[12:37] <darksydephil> okay, stream working for everyone? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> ok tweeting time 
[12:39] <darksydephil> what? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> 4 hours for 30 bucks? that had better be wrong 

[12:40] <darksydephil> okay brb, grabbing drinks and brushing my hair which is out of control 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170916-01 DISHONORED DOTO 2ND.LOG 

[11:58] <darksydephil> wassap all 

[11:58] <darksydephil> getting set up now, almost ready to go 

[11:59] <darksydephil> i am, but im probably gonna suck being that its an ARC systems game, sadly i hate that 
engine 

[12:00] <darksydephil> it looks EXACTLY like guilty gear from waht i just watched 
[12:00] <darksydephil> and thats not good for me lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> honestly the game will probably get dominated by pro GG players 

[12:00] <darksydephil> i hate games with looping combos and the like and thats exactly what it looks like it has 

[12:01] <darksydephil> get a lucky dash in, do a string, either do a combo extender or reset, do the same string, 

use a finisher, wash, rinse, repeat 

[12:01] <darksydephil> thats boring to me lol 

[12:01] <darksydephil> i hope there are characters that aren't all about the combo strings, like grapplers and 
zoners and the like 

[12:01] <darksydephil> guilty gear DID have that 

[12:05] <darksydephil> Guilty Gear is one of the most complex fighting game engines out there, there's just 
layers and layers to it 

[12:06] <darksydephil> reversals and combo breaks and loops and all kinds of shit 
[12:06] <darksydephil> yes and no 

[12:07] <darksydephil> its great for high level competitive play, but it makes it nearly impossible for newcomers 
to jump in and have any kind of a chance against people who have been playing hte series all along, and DBFZ is 
NEW, yet if it has the same engine as an existing series, that's going to be a problem for a lot of people 
[12:08] <darksydephil> are there tutorials in the beta? 

[12:08] <darksydephil> be if not, im just gonna get destroyed 




[12:08] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:09] <darksydephil> is the stream working folks? 

[12:09] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet it out thanks 

[12:12] <darksydephil> lol Jedah STILL OP after all this time? come on 

[12:12] <darksydephil> Jedah was insane in Darkstalkers 3 lol, hands down the best character, nobody could 
even touch him 

[12:14] <darksydephil> MvC2 sentinel was inadvertently one of the best characters lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> he was meant to be slow and lumbering but the idiots who made the game gave him 

flight cancels out of every good move, so he could just float around juggling the fuck out of you 

[12:15] <darksydephil> see, if MvC2 Cable were in a modern game, he’d just be patched out to fix air hyper 

viper beam lol 

[12:15] <darksydephil> but back then, there were no patches for arcade and console games so he was godlike 
[12:16] <darksydephil> ok brb then we’ll start prestream 

[12:17] <darksydephil> by the way, did anyone see how BAD the collector's edition of MvC Infinite is??? its 
HILARIOUS 

[12:18] <darksydephil> its supposed to come with a box of infinity stones that glow, instead, its a bunch of 
colored plastic eggs 

[12:19] <darksydephil> Popsicolo id add you right now if i knew what menu it was in, but sadly, twitch menus 
are overly complicated and i have no idea lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170916-02 DBFZ BETA 1ST.LOG 

[18:00] <darksydephil> im right here 

[18:00] <darksydephil> going to see if this works before i start a stream

[18:06] <darksydephil> theres no tutorial but i have the moveslist on my phone 

[18:06] <darksydephil> oh great, moves with no button inputs 

[18:06] <darksydephil> ki charge, vanish and sparking blast all have nothing assigned lol. so how the fuck do 
you do them 

[18:08] <darksydephil> im gonna test a match and see if it works 
[18:08] <darksydephil> great the guys just left the fight area....wtf 
[18:10] <darksydephil> i have no idea how to ready up for a fight.... 

[18:10] <darksydephil> sigh 

[18:11] <darksydephil> a bunch of people are standing around and no matches are starting lol 
[18:11] <darksydephil> its just a central ring area 

[18:12] <darksydephil> everyone is in it, some are fighting, tons are not, and no idea why 
[18:13] <darksydephil> okay i figured it out 

[18:13] <darksydephil> you have to talk to an npc to get into matchmaking apparently 
[18:13] <darksydephil> im gonna play a match to make sure it works 

[18:17] <darksydephil> uh first guy i fight has full knowledge of the game, doing crazy combos, tagging in and 
out. game explains nothing so i hvae no idea how to tag or throw 
[18:17] <darksydephil> great lol 

[18:17] <darksydephil> this is going to be a waste of time 
[18:17] <darksydephil> its obvious this is going to be all weekend btw 
[18:17] <darksydephil> everyone is going to know how to play lol 
[18:22] <darksydephil> lolol this game is impossible to play without practice 
[18:22] <darksydephil> i have no idea whatsoever what im doing 

[18:23] <darksydephil> i dont even know how to get in with normal attacks, people are just hitting me random 
shit i dont understand 

[18:24] <darksydephil> looking at the moves list now 




[18:24] <darksydephil> i have no idea what super dash is lol 

[18:25] <darksydephil> the moveslist i have is awful be it reads like you're playing on xbox one 
[18:25] <darksydephil> so its like, use the right bumper! what the fuck is right bumper 

[18:26] <darksydephil> ok ill start the stream, but i have no idea wtf is going on. doubt ill win a single match, i 
fought 2 matches where they knew how to play and whupped my ass with giant combos

[12:30] <darksydephil> okay almost done with this email 

[12:30] <darksydephil> so today's the last day to cheer #charity and they almost hit 100k, nice 

[12:32] <darksydephil> okay so for some reason, dark blue text looks like shit on this tv im using as a monitor

[12:33] <darksydephil> very odd, it looks blurry as hell, while grey text is like, SUPER clear 
[12:33] <darksydephil> stream starting up now! 

[12:35] <darksydephil> so theres a new extension minigame for twitch called Bitboss, apparenlty when people 
cheer with bits it attacks a boss and stuff 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i haven't looked into it yet but apparently a bunch of streamers are trying it and people 
love it, cheering like crazy lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> yeah ill look into it hwen i get a chance, haven't had any time, just heard about it last 
night 

[12:37] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:37] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet it out 
[12:39] <darksydephil> for the millionth time 
[12:39] <darksydephil> i dont watch youtube videos

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170919-01 MVC INFINITE 1ST.LOG 

[12:21] <darksydephil> wassap everyone 

[12:22] <darksydephil> seems mvc infinite is pretty full featured 

[12:22] <darksydephil> tutorial, individual character challenges, and a story mode all before going online, thats 
good 

[12:23] <darksydephil> definittely gotta do teh tutorial here be they changed a bunch from previous marvel 






games 

[12:23] <darksydephil> there are no assist attacks anymore and the "tagging" is very very different apparently 
[12:24] <darksydephil> yeah the game has stupid easy mode shortcuts lol 
[12:24] <darksydephil> auto combos and easy supers 
[12:24] <darksydephil> for newbs 

[12:28] <darksydephil> having some audio issues, trying to fix them now 

[12:31] <darksydephil> okay i got the audio fixed 

[12:31] <darksydephil> venom is from MvCl 

[12:31] <darksydephil> i wonder if he’ll play the same 

[12:31] <darksydephil> he sucked in MvCl by the way lol 

[12:32] <darksydephil> best MvCl characters were Strider, Wolverine, War Machine/Gold War Machine, and 
Red/White Venom 

[12:33] <darksydephil> Morrigan was awful 

[12:33] <darksydephil> okay gonna get the stream started, hold up a sec 

[12:34] <darksydephil> yeah thats very true, in every versus game the street fighter characters suck. Exception 
being Akuma in Xmen vs SF who was godlike and Chun-Li in MvC 1 who was mid tier 
[12:35] <darksydephil> probably Sentinel, then maybe Magneto 

[12:36] <darksydephil> they should have put Blackheart in this MvC, he’s such a unique character 
[12:36] <darksydephil> but you know, that would have taken effort 

[12:36] <darksydephil> Juggernaut wouldn't work in MvC infinite be it's too combo heavy and he's not a combo 
character at all, he’d get trounced on 

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay, stream working for everyone? 

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 
[12:49] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks

live 

[19:35] <darksydephil> nope, we’re about to 

[19:37] <darksydephil> yeah, far too many people who weren't supposed to get early copies got them claiming to 
be "media" lol. that always happens with fighting games now 

[19:38] <darksydephil> turn it on? that'd either be in internet settings or there would be a keyboard shortcut for 
it, usually using the function key and a number together or someting like that 
[19:38] <darksydephil> ok stream working folks? 

[19:39] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet that we’re live 

[19:42] <darksydephil> what a hilarious fellow 

[19:42] <darksydephil> now he can tell all of his jokes to the wall 

[19:42] <darksydephil> well, i have 20 years of experience, it kind of helps 

[19:42] <darksydephil> actually 25 years lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> this game has no new mechanics really 

[19:43] <darksydephil> its all previous stuff from the VS series with a few tweaks 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170920-01 MVC INFINITE 3RD.LOG 

[12:27] <darksydephil> im probably gonna be a bit late everyone 

[12:27] <darksydephil> how late i dont know 

[12:27] <darksydephil> on the phone right now 

[12:27] <darksydephil> no good news, thats why im on the phone now 

[12:32] <darksydephil> sigh 

[12:33] <darksydephil> anyway folks 

[12:33] <darksydephil> i can get set up now 





[12:36] <darksydephil> just a heads up everyone 

[12:36] <darksydephil> right now, not in a very good mood, but nothing to do with you guys and im hoping 
todyas stream will cheer me up a bit 

[12:36] <darksydephil> i’d like to punch a wall but that wont help anything 
[12:38] <darksydephil> i've punched walls before, thats why i know its a bad idea 

[12:39] <darksydephil> sooo now my headphones wont work with my ps4 after waking it from rest mode, i have 
to restart the ps4 entirely 

[12:39] <darksydephil> ive changed nothing, this is just a new thing now 
[12:39] <darksydephil> lol 
[12:40] <darksydephil> yeah 

[12:40] <darksydephil> okay, looks like stuff working now 

[12:43] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:43] <darksydephil> stream working everyone? 

[12:43] <darksydephil> by the way, I may be playing mvc all day today 

[12:43] <darksydephil> it seems like i probably want to be only 3.5 hours probably isnt enough 

[12:44] <darksydephil> Karlis FYI, im going to give you a shoutout for your cheer but giong to remove it as top 

cheer as technically it was before the stream started 

[12:46] <darksydephil> okay brb grabbng drinks, oh i dont want to just skip it karlis, that wouldn’t be fair to you, 
you deserve a shoutout 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170920-02 MVC INFINITE 4TH.LOG 

[19:41] <darksydephil> okay back 

[19:42] <darksydephil> just gotta add the earlier videos to playlist and then we can start here 

[19:49] <darksydephil> when i practice with different charactrse, everyone complains lol 

[19:49] <darksydephil> so im just gonna focus on the 4 i played with so far, ill try Haggar tonight 

[19:51] <darksydephil> i dont remember much about mvc3 at all lol 

[19:54] <darksydephil> let me know if/when its working and ill tweet it out 

[22:18] <darksydephil> you want to wait for DBFZ, this game is ass 

[22:19] <darksydephil> another game for dumb fucks and kids to watch on stream 

[22:19] <darksydephil> its serious garbage, at least online, you can't react to any of the stupid pattern combo shit 
[22:22] <darksydephil> no, it isn’t lol 

[22:22] <darksydephil> you must blink a lot, because there were tons of dropped frames of animation tonight 
[22:23] <darksydephil> that was far from smooth gameplay 

[22:23] <darksydephil> "all the other fgc streamers" yup, see, you hit it on the head 

[22:23] <darksydephil> they also all say that SFV is great 

[22:23] <darksydephil> so yeah, believe whatever they say lol 

[22:24] <darksydephil> rollback netcode is and always has been garbage 

[22:24] <darksydephil> whatever DBFZ is using, that was fucking tops 

[22:25] <darksydephil> any time an animation is skipped or there is rollback, it's trash 

[22:26] <darksydephil> that ruins a competitive match 

[22:26] <darksydephil> of course you can, the combos are super easy to execute lol 
[22:26] <darksydephil> thats why i called it Playschool fighter 

[22:26] <darksydephil> the entire game is just getting those showy combos, theres nothing else to it. the 
characters without them like Hulk suck ass 

[22:42] <darksydephil> nightbot's page is down, so i can’t update the schedule command lol. oh well

[12:34] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:34] <darksydephil> almost ready to go live 

[12:35] <darksydephil> im tired as fuck, got like 4 hours sleep, so this should be fun 
[12:42] <darksydephil> stream working for all? 

[12:42] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet 





[12:44] <darksydephil> they're not pros, lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> EVERYONE can spam the combos because tehyr'e easy as fuck to spam, that's the 
problem with this game, it's just bad 

[12:45] <darksydephil> no, that's what BAD 2D fighters bring lol 
[12:45] <darksydephil> neither, they both suck 
[12:45] <darksydephil> for different reasons 

[17:09] <darksydephil> MvC Infinite is a game for the small minded, so no surprise so many think it's good lol 
[17:14] <darksydephil> if you know where it's from, you can get out too 

[17:14] <darksydephil> because it's not right to be using her likeness without permission just because she’s my 
ex girlfriend, it's fucked up actually 

[17:14] <darksydephil> and whoever is using it should be banned from twitch 

[17:15] <darksydephil> im pretty sure she would have to contact twitch, not me, and shes totally gone from all 

this kind of shit on purpose to stay away from negative shit just like that 

[17:40] <darksydephil> yeah apparently all of deep's devices went kaput 

[17:40] <darksydephil> thats rough 

[17:40] <darksydephil> all at fucking once

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170922-02 MVC INFINITE 6TH (1ST CANCELLED, FIRE ALARM 

INSPECTIONj.LOG 

[15:29] <darksydephil> well sorry all 

[15:29] <darksydephil> would have liked to stream but yeah, inspector just left 

[15:30] <darksydephil> i figure i should get my personal shit done first and then maybe stream later tonight, 
we’ll see 

[15:30] <darksydephil> guy was supposed to show up at 1pm, he showed up nearly at 2, and then took 90 
minutes be the neighbors alarm was busted 

[17:42] <darksydephil> MvC Infinite stream starting around 6:30pm PDT tonight!!!! 

[18:32] <darksydephil> test 

[18:32] <darksydephil> testing 

[18:32] <darksydephil> can anyone see this? 

[18:32] <darksydephil> oh good finally 

[18:33] <darksydephil> coulnd’t get stream chat working for like 5 minutes on my laptop 

[18:33] <darksydephil> twitch updated the entire site and its different now 

[18:34] <darksydephil> yeah my entire thing is dark mode now 

[18:34] <darksydephil> even though i never set it up to be 

[18:34] <darksydephil> and stuff looks/loads differently now 

[18:34] <darksydephil> no it did it by default both on my desktop and laptop lol 

[18:35] <darksydephil> okay give me a sec to get stuff set up on the desktop now and we can start 

[18:35] <darksydephil> honestly i think i just want to play MP tonight and maybe arcade mode? i dunno wtf 

arcade mode is, since there was a story mode, i dont feel like new characters tonight 

[18:35] <darksydephil> save that for tomorrow 

[18:36] <darksydephil> oh, so theres no point then lol 

[18:39] <darksydephil> yeah that inspector pretty much threw off my entire work day 
[18:39] <darksydephil> was supposed to be here at 1pm, didnt show up until 2 





[18:39] <darksydephil> then next door the alarm system was malfunctioning so it took him over 90 minutes to 
fix it 

[18:39] <darksydephil> it was well after 3:30pm by the time he left,made no sense to start a stream then 
[18:40] <darksydephil> yeah shit happens, monday will be the same thing really 
[18:40] <darksydephil> although i hope to start way earlier than today 
[18:41] <darksydephil> okay, is the stream working now? 

[18:41] <darksydephil> okay let me tweet that we’re live 

[18:48] <darksydephil> when i play this game, it feels like i'm playing with those building blocks for tykes 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170923-01 MVC INFINITE 7TH.LOG 

[12:24] <darksydephil> okay then 

[12:24] <darksydephil> first person i see is an idiot 

[12:24] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:26] <darksydephil> good, enjoying the overall ignorance and stupidity of others this morning 

[12:26] <darksydephil> like the guy who refuses to believe N.Korea said they want to destroy the US because 

FOX news reported it, and anything FOX news says is propaganda 

[12:28] <darksydephil> yeah after yesterday im definitely out of beginners 

[12:28] <darksydephil> i think im 13 still, not sure 

[12:29] <darksydephil> yeah be gamora is even more easy mode than those who have to wave/airdash to spam 
their combos lol 

[12:30] <darksydephil> you must not have watched my DBFZ coverage apparenlty 
[12:36] <darksydephil> no, not everyone is stupid 
[12:36] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:37] <darksydephil> nobody cares about Pokken DX 

[12:37] <darksydephil> everyone cares about me trashing this garbage game 

[12:38] <darksydephil> Pokken DX is an over 1.5 year old game 

[12:40] <darksydephil> Drilbit777 , it's a new release, use common sense, viewers want new release coverage, 
ESPECIALLY when every FGC head is kissing this game's ass for money, and every other casual streamer is so 
ignorant of fighters they can't tell it's a bad game 

[12:40] <darksydephil> Pokken DX isn't a new release, it's a re-release, equivalent to a GOTY edition with 
slightly better graphics 

[12:42] <darksydephil> is the stream working folks? 

[12:42] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet it out 
[12:45] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks 

[12:50] <darksydephil> chat rules are publicly listed on my channel, it's not our fault if you come in here talking 
nonsense like on "another fgc stream" And get banned, it's your fault if you can't read 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170923-02 MARIO+RABBIDS 8TH.LOG 

[19:34] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:34] <darksydephil> just tweeted out the marvel vids, time to get some mario on! 

[19:34] <darksydephil> oops gotta switch cables first 
[19:41] <darksydephil> Mario streams are always mild and fun 

[19:42] <darksydephil> although we get CRITICAL CRITICAL CRITICAL CRITICAL hit 

[19:43] <darksydephil> the return? they never left, last week was dragon ball, this week it's marvel, still fighting 

games every Sunday 

[19:43] <darksydephil> okay stream working? 

[19:44] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet it out 
[19:45] <darksydephil> i had a salad 
[19:45] <darksydephil> homemade caesar salad 

[19:46] <darksydephil> no, the next version will be called...the DOUBLE Switch! 

[19:46] <darksydephil> Cryin' on the Moon edition 
[22:08] <darksydephil> stupid misclicks 





[22:08] <darksydephil> modding on this laptop is a nightmare 

[22:09] <darksydephil> my clicks are actually delayed when the stream chat gets fast moving 
[22:09] <darksydephil> so it'll look like im banning the right person, then NOPE 
[22:09] <darksydephil> oh hell no lol 
[22:09] <darksydephil> thats even worse 

[22:10] <darksydephil> you really need a good tablet or pc to mod properly, my laptop would be fine if i had the 
chat normally but i have it as a popout so i can see othe rstuff like Muxy and the stream, and thats what causese 
the lag

[12:52] <darksydephil> no more offensive talk, this is the Twitch police, this is now a PG chat 
[12:53] <darksydephil> NO MORE OFFENSIVE TALK!

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170925-02 MVC INFINITE 9TH (1ST CANCELLED, APPOINTMENT).LOG 

[16:06] <darksydephil> hello 

[16:06] <darksydephil> so im not ready yet, still got a few things to take care of and i have to eat 
[16:06] <darksydephil> after that we'll think about the stream, maybe 6pm, we’ll see 
[16:07] <darksydephil> maybe a 6-10pm late night salt stream 

[16:07] <darksydephil> and then tomorrow ill try new characters, im digging nemesis/thanos too much to switch 
tonight lol 

[17:54] <darksydephil> wassap all 

[17:55] <darksydephil> ill be setting up shortly here for the stream 
[17:55] <darksydephil> finally got everything done 

[18:02] <darksydephil> i may not be as salty playing tonight, i may be all salted out at this point, i dunno 
[18:03] <darksydephil> im feeling more reserved than anything today 
[18:03] <darksydephil> i honestly have had fun since i started playing nemesis/thanos 
[18:03] <darksydephil> thats why ive stuck with them 

[18:04] <darksydephil> nah im just not feeling like, super raged or energetic or anything tonight, maybe be its 
later or maybe be of my meeting earlier, who knows 
[18:05] <darksydephil> ok ill turn on the stream 

[18:06] <darksydephil> nah nothing is determined yet so theres nothing to open up about yet 
[18:06] <darksydephil> why is my twitch dashboard different lol 
[18:06] <darksydephil> i guess they updated it, stuff is moved around 
[18:06] <darksydephil> and they reset my default ad breaks 

[18:07] <darksydephil> yeah i know, ive got 1-2 major streams a day when i talk with stream chat, ive got 
twitter, a personal e-mail and forums. "Phil needs to interact more." Huh??? 

[18:07] <darksydephil> do you want me to move into your house? 

[18:08] <darksydephil> I'll move in with Fred Fuchs 
[18:08] <darksydephil> fuck with him constantly IRL 





[18:08] <darksydephil> that would be a good show 

[18:08] <darksydephil> me just constantly bugging the fuck out of him 

[18:09] <darksydephil> thats fine 

[18:09] <darksydephil> i’d bang his mom and live with him. become his stepdad 
[18:09] <darksydephil> now THAT would be a good show 

[18:11] <darksydephil> no lie, if i had friends into filmmaking, id make that show right now. an internet 
personality moves in with his biggest troll and bangs him mom to fuck with him. that's comedy gold 
[18:12] <darksydephil> Team No Effort, sounds just about right 
[18:12] <darksydephil> okay 

[18:13] <darksydephil> so the stream is working folks? 

[18:13] <darksydephil> i’d say Dormammu, Ultron, Jedah and Dante are the top 4 in MvC infinite with Captain 

Marvel, Strider, maybe Spidey right behind them 

[18:15] <darksydephil> yeah Gamora is up there for sure 

[18:21] <darksydephil> im trying to get my headphones to work 

[18:21] <darksydephil> i think i need another new optical cable for them 

[21:10] <darksydephil> guys, can we please cut out the political talk, thanks 

[21:10] <darksydephil> seriously, its not called for here and just starting problems 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170926-01 MVC INFINITE 10TH.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> yeah this will be fun, im gonna play all the characters ive tried up to this point vs 
venomousfatman today 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i guess i may do a lobby where people can join and play me later this week, like 
tomorrow or thursday 

[12:35] <darksydephil> since random ranked matchesa re getting playe dout 

[12:35] <darksydephil> well i can do a private lobby 

[12:35] <darksydephil> and invite manually through friends list 

[12:36] <darksydephil> i like that somehow Nemesis and Thanos are color coordinated two different ways lol 

[12:36] <darksydephil> but yeah today ill try Chun, Hulk, Ultron and Morrigan as well as my Nemesis/Thanos. 

prob not Haggar, I couldn’t get anything going with him 

[12:36] <darksydephil> who else did i even try? i cant remember 

[12:37] <darksydephil> oh Captain Marvel, thats right 

[12:38] <darksydephil> stream working folks? 

[12:38] <darksydephil> ok tweeting time 
[13:34] <darksydephil> still setting up guys 

[13:36] <darksydephil> venomousfatman had to do some updates and i guess they’re not done yet

[12:30] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:30] <darksydephil> stream starts in just a sec 

[12:30] <darksydephil> setting up now 






[12:36] <darksydephil> its just stupidity that games would either be console or PC exclusive in the modern area, 
honestly 

[12:36] <darksydephil> Divinity is the best game that a good half of the playerbase will never play because its 
PC exclusive 

[12:36] <darksydephil> and that's a huge missed opportunity 

[12:37] <darksydephil> if it ports, it won’t matter, the game will be old and the hype long dead 
[12:39] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> ok time to tweet it out 

[12:41] <darksydephil> I’d say this game deserves about a 7.5 honestly 
[12:41] <darksydephil> its nowhere near as good as other modern fighters 

[12:41] <darksydephil> Cuphead is released on Friday, why are people talking about it 2 days beforehand.... 
[12:42] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks 
[12:49] <darksydephil> sales were low eh? 

[12:49] <darksydephil> why did heartless just get banned 

[12:49] <darksydephil> that wasnt me 

[12:50] <darksydephil> 2 MILLION COPIES? LOL 

[12:50] <darksydephil> are they retarded 

[17:02] <darksydephil> wow i had a 13 win streak today lol 

[17:02] <darksydephil> thats nuts 

[17:02] <darksydephil> oh wait, no i didnt 

[17:02] <darksydephil> hold on 

[17:03] <darksydephil> looks like i ahd a 7 win streak, damn 
[17:03] <darksydephil> oh wait 
[17:03] <darksydephil> no i had 11 
[17:03] <darksydephil> 11 wins okay 

[17:04] <darksydephil> i dunno how to see worldwide rankings 
[17:04] <darksydephil> i know they exist 

[17:04] <darksydephil> it exists, someone tweeted me it the other day but i have no idea where the fuck it is 

[17:04] <darksydephil> the menu system is awful in this game 

[17:05] <darksydephil> here it is, found it 

[17:05] <darksydephil> let me see if i can find me 

[17:06] <darksydephil> holy fuck 

[17:06] <darksydephil> im top 100 

[17:06] <darksydephil> 97 lol 

[17:06] <darksydephil> im gonna screepcap and tweet this 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170927-02 MARIO+RABBIDS 10TH.LOG 

[19:22] <darksydephil> I do? lol 

[19:33] <darksydephil> im not effected by estate tax lol 

[19:34] <darksydephil> because im finsihing up with the mvc vids right now 

[19:34] <darksydephil> putting them in playlist 

[19:34] <darksydephil> then the stream will begin 

[19:36] <darksydephil> im still confused by lentils 

[19:36] <darksydephil> estate tax only affects the super rich, because they can afford to have estates 
[19:36] <darksydephil> its unclear if Trump's tax changes pass how they'll affect me. he’s claiming to want to 
help both individuals and small business so you'd THINK that owuld mean less tax for me, but who knows 
[19:40] <darksydephil> stream working? 

[19:41] <darksydephil> nice, ill tweet, then we’ll chat 

[19:43] <darksydephil> im almost positive it's been reached at this point 

[19:43] <darksydephil> like, the only way it would not be reached would be if an incredible number of people 

who have ongoing pledges get declined 

[19:43] <darksydephil> and that usually doesnt happen 




-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170928-01 MVC INFINITE 12TH.LOG 

[12:15] <darksydephil> wassap 
[12:16] <darksydephil> its going good 

[12:16] <darksydephil> in fact i have an announcement on prestream today, a very positive one 

[12:18] <darksydephil> yeah i can't talk fully about it yet but i can at least start giving general info 

[12:19] <darksydephil> that literally looks nothing like me 

[12:20] <darksydephil> much fatter face, bald, wraparound beard, all different 

[12:20] <darksydephil> just the same pose as the emote i already had 

[12:21] <darksydephil> speaking of emotes 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i have to submit that new one! 

[12:21] <darksydephil> oh wow 
[12:22] <darksydephil> i have an open slot! 

[12:22] <darksydephil> i qualify for 15 emotes now 

[12:23] <darksydephil> i guess with all the changes they did it increased capacity 
[12:23] <darksydephil> thats cool 

[12:23] <darksydephil> that toga would be perfect to wear today, its hot as balls here, in the 80s 
[12:23] <darksydephil> and tomorrow its gonna be in the 50s dropping over 20 degrees farenheit lol 
[12:24] <darksydephil> i’d say either Dante or Spider-Man 

[12:32] <darksydephil> um, i dont have beef with Jaha or anyone? If there's beef it's completely one-sided, I 
haven't talked to anybody in the FGC in ages 

[12:32] <darksydephil> I assume people either make shit up or are just trying to make drama to get attention or 
something 

[12:32] <darksydephil> but I honestly have no intention of returning to the FGC 
[12:36] <darksydephil> okay, is the stream working? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet it out, thanks all 
[12:39] <darksydephil> its cool Kekon 
[12:39] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i stopped playing USF2 so everyone quit? i wouldn’t be surprised 

[12:40] <darksydephil> ive got good, positive news to talk about today on prestream, actually 2 helpings of it 

[12:40] <darksydephil> 2 delicious helpings 

[16:59] <darksydephil> damn i had a 33 winstreak lol

[19:41] <darksydephil> why would i know anything about Spoony? lol 
[19:42] <darksydephil> and 

[19:42] <darksydephil> what does that have to do with me? 

[19:42] <darksydephil> so, people are idiots then? 

[19:42] <darksydephil> there will always be idiots 

[19:42] <darksydephil> we don't have to discuss their idiocy lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> how could I possibly "help spoony out?" 





[19:43] <darksydephil> what on earth are you talking about 
[19:44] <darksydephil> this is quite a lot of nonsense, lol 
[19:44] <darksydephil> this literally has nothing to do with me 
[19:44] <darksydephil> anyway 

[19:44] <darksydephil> im going to start talking on stream now.... 

[19:45] <darksydephil> you can, uh, discuss things completely unrelated to me here i guess. 

[22:54] <darksydephil> only 19 and you're eating shit?? 

[22:54] <darksydephil> god damn 

[22:54] <darksydephil> straight out of the toilet 

[22:57] <darksydephil> that has to suck 

[22:57] <darksydephil> be fried chicken is fing good 

[22:57] <darksydephil> and i’d hate for that to be spoiled permanently be of a bad experience 

[22:59] <darksydephil> that's good, but if they're willing to give you that, it means they know they fed up 

royally and you could probably have sued for tons of money lol 

[23:08] <darksydephil> i never understood why dolares is a word in Spanish be the currency is pesos in Mexico 
and something else in spain, right? 

[23:09] <darksydephil> or maybe im wrong 

[23:10] <darksydephil> yeah i think they do now actually 

[23:10] <darksydephil> but not always, it used to be something else
