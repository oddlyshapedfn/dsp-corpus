[11:03] <darksydephil> oh wtf 

[11:04] <darksydephil> chat has been glitchy all morning! 

[11:04] <darksydephil> i had to refresh 3 times, then type to get your chat to show up wtf 

[11:04] <darksydephil> i thought chat was down 

[11:06] <darksydephil> ok stream starting in a moment 

[11:06] <darksydephil> for some reason there’ sno audio.... 

[11:07] <darksydephil> wtf 
[11:10] <darksydephil> there we go 

[11:10] <darksydephil> had to totally unplug/replug everything in for no good reason 
[11:10] <darksydephil> coudln’t get audio otherwise lol 
[11:13] <darksydephil> stream working now? with audio? 

[11:14] <darksydephil> oh look, a whiner, despite the fact i’m actively working the stream to get it to work and 

explained there were tech difficulties lol 

[11:15] <darksydephil> good thing i didnt rip a massive fart 

[11:15] <darksydephil> ok im gonan tweet that we’re live 

[11:17] <darksydephil> thats how i stream, gives time to work out bugs and build up the stream before i start, 
and i always give the amount of gameplay i promise (used to be 3, now 4 hours), there's nothig to complain 
about, you’re just impatient 
[11:17] <darksydephil> so please stop whining 

[11:17] <darksydephil> people have been playing this game since early monday. im not going to be super 

surprised that attendance isn’t great, sorry 

[11:18] <darksydephil> ok gonns piss, then prestream time 

[11:24] <darksydephil> audio dropped? 

[11:24] <darksydephil> can you hear me now? 

[11:24] <darksydephil> wtf 

[11:54] <darksydephil> i started playing and stream views are dropping, lol 

[11:54] <darksydephil> im not feeling too optimistic about this playthrough, and im playing it all week, sigh 
[13:33] <darksydephil> because i need to play this to review the game? 

[13:33] <darksydephil> lol 

[16:04] <darksydephil> im still streaming 

[16:04] <darksydephil> so it has to bet twitch 

[16:13] <darksydephil> Gazza2305 instead of spamming that, why not explain? what the fuck exactly SHOULD 
i be doing during a gameplay stream that i'm not doing? 

[16:14] <darksydephil> because right now you just sound like a dumb fuck parrot 

[16:14] <darksydephil> yes, is that it? should i be whipping my tits out during the stream? or telling unrelated 
stories? 

[16:14] <darksydephil> if i’m going to do that, why play the game? lol 

[16:15] <darksydephil> "interact with your audience" lol the other generic answer from brainless kids 
[16:15] <darksydephil> okay, so then ill just talk with my audience the entire time and not even play the game, 
how about that? 

[16:15] <darksydephil> because that's all there is too it! 

[16:16] <darksydephil> see, you proved your moronic intelligence level, so you can fuck off now lol 
[16:16] <darksydephil> that would probably be the single dumbest thing i could possibly do Johnnyzee s 
[16:17] <darksydephil> sell off the house that's appreciating in value and move to a place hwer all real estate 
values are tanking, taxes are high, and my business will be worse off lol 

[16:18] <darksydephil> well that's the problem skysands2017 , the common viewer isn't an intelligent human, it's 
a dumbfuck kid who wants clowns on stream, not actual gameplay 




[16:18] <darksydephil> Johnnyzees thta doesn't even make sense, how can i make sure the stream is running 
and working with the chat closed? 

[16:19] <darksydephil> the dashboard doesn't show anything lol. i’d have no idea if theres an audio issue or even 
if the steram is having problems. 

[16:19] <darksydephil> when? 

[16:19] <darksydephil> ive always had stream chat open for that very purpose 
[16:20] <darksydephil> before i streamed i was recording offline with a camera! lol 
[16:20] <darksydephil> of ocurse it was working then 
[16:20] <darksydephil> the camera was in front of my face 
[16:20] <darksydephil> so i knew it was on lol 

[16:20] <darksydephil> no, direct capture and streaming went hand in hand, i did them together 

[16:20] <darksydephil> and the rare times that i do offline capture w/o streaming, sometimes theres tech stuff i 

don’t catch and theres no way to do so 

[16:21] <darksydephil> what are you talking about? optimize settings? 

[16:21] <darksydephil> we’re talking about stuff going wrong, like sound going out, out of nowhere 
[16:21] <darksydephil> or the stream chopping up etc 
[16:21] <darksydephil> or going down completely 

[16:21] <darksydephil> mods aren’t watching the stream 24/7. they're not paid to do so 

[16:22] <darksydephil> whats the problem with the chat???? you’re the only person here who has issue with it ilol 
[16:22] <darksydephil> uuum 

[16:22] <darksydephil> did you ever watch my stuff pre-2013? 

[16:22] <darksydephil> i did all of those things lol 

[16:23] <darksydephil> this game isn't bad and i'm not unhappy, im just not understanding the insane hype and 
praise for a game that's cut/pasted from other games, it doesn’t make it a better/great game at all, especially when 
really the only thing interesting so far is the story 

[16:23] <darksydephil> the combat is repetitive and boring just liek the games it stole from lol 

[16:24] <darksydephil> okay well im off to upload, hope you guys check out my impressions vid tonight and see 

you all tomorrow 

[16:29] <darksydephil> who are these retards 
[16:29] <darksydephil> i said iw as leaving lol 

[16:29] <darksydephil> i move to the desktop and glance over, a slew of idiot kids insulting me? yeah fuck no 
[16:30] <darksydephil> i guess someone sent in the clowns haha 
[16:31] <darksydephil> i like how you're banned 
[16:31] <darksydephil> lol 

[16:31] <darksydephil> who is backseating in this game? the game is seriously easy 
[16:31] <darksydephil> i have no need to backseat 

[16:31] <darksydephil> yes, banning dumbfuck kids is a great way to run my business 
[16:32] <darksydephil> because i dont need their troll bullshit 

[16:38] <darksydephil> people don't watch top twitch streamers for the games KingjadVCMP 
[16:38] <darksydephil> that's become quite obvious hasn't it? 

[16:44] <darksydephil> i didnt start streaming until 2013, but ive kept my content as if i'm doing a playthrough 
for youtube, it's a definite different kind of stuff and the common Twitch viewer doesn't even get it. the first thing 
people say is "why isn't he constantly talking to stream chat?!?!" like that's EXPECTED from someone on twitch 
lol. and that's a joke 

[16:45] <darksydephil> oh look, a "sub" got banned for being a douchebag. goodbye, douchebag 

[16:45] <darksydephil> i swear, some people think that makes htem immune and able to just sit here insult me. 

fuck off lol 

[16:46] <darksydephil> hanging? 

[16:46] <darksydephil> the game wouldn’t run anymor eon my PC lol 

[16:48] <darksydephil> nothing is going to bring in the views, nintendo fanboys are too stupid to understand that 
my criticisms of the company aren’t hate. People are already shitting all over Ghost Recon. ME won’t live up to 
the first trilogy so people will dumb on that, there's an excuse why everything I play is bad, for some reason, 



when i play it but nobody else! 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i just updated the channel title, next stream is tomorrow 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170302-01 HORIZON ZD 4TH.LOG 

[11:05] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:05] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[11:09] <darksydephil> how are they supposed to make more Overwatch porn if the new character is a robot?!? 
[11:09] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:12] <darksydephil> how would uploading an entire 4+ hour video, whcih nobody will watch in one sitting, 
raise my average % viewed? it would do exactly the opposite effect lol 
[11:12] <darksydephil> i hate to tell you this CapstoneGaming 

[11:12] <darksydephil> but pretty much new games are the only things i get views on, with maybe a couple of 
exceptions, but if i didnt play new gams, i wouldn’t get any views 
[11:13] <darksydephil> mikebpfallon 

[11:13] <darksydephil> do you mean to return to the original ruins from the intro? 

[11:13] <darksydephil> then yes, i saw it lol 
[11:17] <darksydephil> ok is the stream working? 

[11:18] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:18] <darksydephil> then grab some drinks and get started 

[11:19] <darksydephil> lol KOGaming keeps unsubbing people, superb, so fing stupid, but youtube isn’t aware 
of an issue! 

[11:19] <darksydephil> oh ok, i muted it 
[11:19] <darksydephil> good thing i didnt go on a racist rant 
[11:20] <darksydephil> ok gonna grab some drinks 
[11:20] <darksydephil> brb 

[11:48] <darksydephil> 200 people on day 3 for a new release, what a hot, interesting new game lol 
[11:50] <darksydephil> DeltaForce355 you may be retarded, as we've discussed many times people dont watch 
twitch streams for the games, but the streamers, im sure the people geting 3k views aren't just playing the game 
like i do 

[11:51] <darksydephil> delta, you say dumb shit like this every day 
[11:51] <darksydephil> its obviously your problem, not mine 
[11:51] <darksydephil> yet you're still here lol 
[15:45] <darksydephil> oh look, a retard 

[15:45] <darksydephil> yes, let me talk over the plot dialogue lol 
[15:45] <darksydephil> moron 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170303-01 LAID OFF.LOG 

[10:57] <darksydephil> today may not be such a good day 
[10:57] <darksydephil> sigh 

[10:57] <darksydephil> might not even be streaming right now 

[11:05] <darksydephil> stream isnt cancelled, im just sadly wrapped up in stuff right now 
[11:05] <darksydephil> 5 hours of sleep and the future is uncertain 

[11:06] <darksydephil> well creating stuff only works if you can make money doing it lol 
[11:07] <darksydephil> yeah i really like the shirts 

[11:07] <darksydephil> well the problem there is ive already used patreon for 2 years and pretty much tapped 
that resource 

[11:08] <darksydephil> its not like if my videos on youtube stop getting monetized i can make it up completely 
with patreon 

[11:15] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:16] <darksydephil> so im applying with many different partnership companies, but some of them dont even 
work 

[11:19] <darksydephil> none of that is in any contract jefffauxl218 





[11:19] <darksydephil> that's crazy talk, maybe for big youtubers but certainly not for me lol 
[11:20] <darksydephil> nope 

[11:20] <darksydephil> once the contract is over, it's over, and my channels right now are just waiting on teh 
countdown 

[11:23] <darksydephil> fullscreen's application page doesn’t even work, it just says OOPS something went 
wrong lol 

[11:24] <darksydephil> yeah fullscreen's page doesn't even work, geez 

[11:28] <darksydephil> let me put it this way. i could easily monetize videos myself without a partnership 
company, but that would mean im going to get a ton of content ID matches and issues 
[11:29] <darksydephil> im honestly not sure what to do right now 

[11:31] <darksydephil> theres no way fulltime streaming on twitch would work that i can see 

[11:31] <darksydephil> i need to not take my mind off of this right now and instead focus and figure out a way to 

fix it honestly 

[11:37] <darksydephil> hang tight folks, i think im going to stream and it'll probably be a totally different kind of 
stream....if you catch myd rift 

[11:39] <darksydephil> i really dont have much to lose, and making more gameplay right now might not 
necessarily help anything 

[11:43] <darksydephil> ok so im going to stream but its not going to be anything like id planned, im going to tell 
everyone what's going on to the best of my ability and try to get advice/help, just like i did when i lost my office 
job in 2010 

[11:43] <darksydephil> i think thats the best way to go 

[11:44] <darksydephil> i cant disclose evrything w/machinima but i can explain what's going on righ tnow at 
least 

[11:45] <darksydephil> there is no 2 or 1 month notice, that's complete bs lol. but the situation is pretty unique 
[11:47] <darksydephil> okay im going to stream shortly 

[11:48] <darksydephil> going to grab a few drinks for the stream and then get set up 

[11:50] <darksydephil> okay, going to grab some drinks and then we’ll get started 

[11:53] <darksydephil> ok vev rhwn qw'll arewM 

[11:53] <darksydephil> WTF 

[11:53] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:53] <darksydephil> what i typed was 

[11:53] <darksydephil> ok, brb to get drinks, tehn we’ll stream 

[12:02] <darksydephil> ok getting set up now 

[12:03] <darksydephil> stream will be going live shortly 

[12:10] <darksydephil> stream should be going live 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170303-02 SWITCH UNBOXING.LOG 

[17:00] <darksydephil> Test 

[17:00] <darksydephil> Testing 

[17:01] <darksydephil> Can anyone see this? 

[17:01] <darksydephil> Ok cool im on my phone so its a bit wonky 

[17:02] <darksydephil> Well im thinking about stuff more while i wait for my switch to arrive 

[17:03] <darksydephil> Almost thinking at this point that i could do my gaming exclusively on twitch but then 

use youtube for vlogging only since the gaming thing isnt working there anymore 

[17:04] <darksydephil> Im having serious doubts about getting DSPGaming partnered again 

[17:05] <darksydephil> If i streamed here all the time and then focused on reaction vlogs, news stories and more 

maybe the balance could work, but id have to figure out how to make way more here on twitch for sure 

[17:06] <darksydephil> I dont even know if machinima accepts new partners anymore lol 

[17:07] <darksydephil> The switch has to arrive first for me to do anything with it, lol 

[17:09] <darksydephil> Annabac do you watch any full-time streamers? 

[17:09] <darksydephil> Ok cool 

[17:10] <darksydephil> So how typically would they interact with the stream exactly? 




[17:13] <darksydephil> So it really is all about the donations? That's surprising 

[17:14] <darksydephil> What happens when people donate? On-screen popups? How does it factor into the 
stream? 

[17:15] <darksydephil> I have streamlabs but its kind of wonky 
[17:16] <darksydephil> Sometjmes it doesnt work properly 

[17:17] <darksydephil> Well obviously you shouldnt let racist words be said, you can set up banned words and 
the like 

[17:17] <darksydephil> I wouldnt do speaking donations lol 

[17:20] <darksydephil> Tips not donations. Hmm. Yes my accountant specifically told me not to take 
"donations" be of the irs 

[17:21] <darksydephil> I cant turn off slow mode on my phone lolol 
[17:21] <darksydephil> Give me a sec, ill run to the office to fix it 
[17:22] <darksydephil> oh 
[17:22] <darksydephil> its off now? 

[17:22] <darksydephil> who turned it off? 

[17:22] <darksydephil> lol 

[17:22] <darksydephil> it wasn't me i just got here 
[17:22] <darksydephil> oh okay! 

[17:22] <darksydephil> thanks Icureditwithmybrain 
[17:22] <darksydephil> lol 
[17:24] <darksydephil> Ok back 

[17:24] <darksydephil> So let me see if i get the gist of full time streaming 

[17:25] <darksydephil> More interaction, talking eith stream chat, having notifications for subs/bits/tips 

[17:25] <darksydephil> Making it social like hanging with friends, and being positive 

[17:26] <darksydephil> How do streamers handle the on demand stuff? Leave it up as archives? 

[17:27] <darksydephil> Gaming on youtube may be completely out of the question so im talking about here 

[17:28] <darksydephil> Yeah i wouldnt do sub only vods 

[17:28] <darksydephil> Yes i saw that with the Christmas stream actually 

[17:28] <darksydephil> Chat was preserved 

[17:30] <darksydephil> What would be considered a EU friendly time to stream?? 

[17:31] <darksydephil> Im very interested in trying out the full time streaming thing this week, if nothing works 
out partnering dspgaming again 

[17:32] <darksydephil> Bammbino, if there are no ads on dspgaming, what is there to ween out? It's not making 
anything lol 

[17:33] <darksydephil> Jonsnow is way behind lol 
[17:34] <darksydephil> Oh i gotcha 

[17:35] <darksydephil> I think i can have streamlabs do the popups and such automatically but i have to figure 
out how to get them to show up on stream 

[17:38] <darksydephil> Yeah i dunno if ill be playing full playthroughs of every game doing it this way but if 
people enjoy the streams and they pay my bills then who cares lol 

[17:38] <darksydephil> It just means this will be more about having fun than judging the games and reviewing 
them i guess 

[17:39] <darksydephil> Exactly, if im not recording a full playthrough for youtube then it wont matter if i finish 
anything etc 

[17:41] <darksydephil> I dont think people are getting it lol, i wont be doing gaming on youtube ANY more. 
Because i probably cant get dspgaming partnered again 

[17:42] <darksydephil> Dunno why some keep bringing up youtube, it could literally be dead this week lol 
[17:42] <darksydephil> I already did apply 

[17:44] <darksydephil> Google adsense will take away ad rights for a lot of gameplay vids sadly 

[17:44] <darksydephil> Thats why i said: full time game streams here, vlogging on youtube. I could easily use 

adsense for just vlogging as theres nothing they can flag 

[17:46] <darksydephil> What would be ideal stream times here then? 



[17:47] <darksydephil> I could easily stream earlier, especially if theres no reason to stay up and babysit videos 
etc 

[17:49] <darksydephil> I could start 9-10am my time no problem 

[17:51] <darksydephil> So again, what times pst would be the best to stream? 

[17:52] <darksydephil> I could do 10am pst but not est lol 

[17:52] <darksydephil> Thats 7am here 

[17:54] <darksydephil> They deliver until 8pm here lol 

[17:57] <darksydephil> Oh boy, the switch apparently gives out your ip on certain screens!!! LOL 
[17:57] <darksydephil> Is nintendo for real 

[17:59] <darksydephil> I think the switch is being delivered right now actually 
[17:59] <darksydephil> Let me check brb 
[18:06] <darksydephil> Ok its here 

[18:06] <darksydephil> Im gonna try to set up streamlabs to work with the stream tonight, a good test 

[18:08] <darksydephil> ok im here 

[18:08] <darksydephil> let me take a look at steamlabs 

[18:08] <darksydephil> see how this works exactly lol 

[18:09] <darksydephil> whats that NoobRydar 

[18:10] <darksydephil> okay anyone know how to do this with steamlabs? 

[18:10] <darksydephil> it seems confusing 

[18:10] <darksydephil> oh wait i think i see it 

[18:12] <darksydephil> ok i think ive got this figured out 

[18:12] <darksydephil> no it wasnt noobrydar 

[18:12] <darksydephil> no worries 

[18:13] <darksydephil> yeah im messing with it now 

[18:13] <darksydephil> making sure sounds are OFF lol 

[18:15] <darksydephil> anyone have like 1 bit? because iw ant to test this quickly, dont do it YET but let me 
know if you can 

[18:15] <darksydephil> ok give me a sec, thanks 
[18:16] <darksydephil> okay, can you cheer 1 bit? 

[18:16] <darksydephil> cool it worked but it still played the fucking sound lolol 

[18:16] <darksydephil> and it was loud as shit 

[18:18] <darksydephil> oh, i didnt save the settings 

[18:18] <darksydephil> stupid me lol 

[18:19] <darksydephil> the default picture is a zombie, wtf 

[18:19] <darksydephil> i wonder if i can do this without a picture at all for now 

[18:21] <darksydephil> there may shortly be no way for me to make money on anything but vlogs on youtube 

[18:21] <darksydephil> its not a matter of giving up 

[18:22] <darksydephil> normal adsense will not work, as people have said 

[18:22] <darksydephil> people will click the fuck out of them just to get me kicked out 

[18:25] <darksydephil> ok so i got th enotifications working supposedly, and no pics with it, just text for now as 
this is a test 

[18:26] <darksydephil> what about the messages? leave them for bits or no? 

[18:26] <darksydephil> good call blue_blur64 changing that now 
[18:26] <darksydephil> i made the minimum 25 bits 
[18:27] <darksydephil> should i do more? 100? 

[18:27] <darksydephil> ok ill do 25 then 

[18:27] <darksydephil> it seems to still play msuic sometimes and i dunno why lol 
[18:27] <darksydephil> i turned the sound to 0 for everything 
[18:28] <darksydephil> bit messages on or off? 

[18:28] <darksydephil> ok 

[18:28] <darksydephil> prepare for insults 

[18:28] <darksydephil> lol 



[18:30] <darksydephil> okay i think we’re good to go, lets see how this turns out lol. could be spam city 

[18:31] <darksydephil> LOL it could say nothing i coudl do or SON OF A BITCH when people do thsi 

[18:31] <darksydephil> thats pretty funny man 

[18:32] <darksydephil> people will be doing rude cheers i insure lol 

[18:33] <darksydephil> thanks faily but wtf 

[18:33] <darksydephil> it made another LOUD NOISE when you did that 

[18:33] <darksydephil> how the fuck do i turn it off lol 

[18:35] <darksydephil> OKAY i found what the problem was 

[18:35] <darksydephil> muting that shit now 

[18:35] <darksydephil> it's hidden in a special alerts menu 

[18:39] <darksydephil> oh hmm

[18:39] <darksydephil> no need for 1080p here, wait is the switch 1080p? i dont even know lol 

[18:40] <darksydephil> ill do 720p and 60fps

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170304-01 SWITCH BROKEN, HORIZON ZD 5TH TRAINWRECK.LOG 

[10:57] <darksydephil> well folks, we've got a major problem 
[10:57] <darksydephil> the switch doens't work lolol 
[10:57] <darksydephil> it doesn’t turn on at all 
[10:57] <darksydephil> i left it chargin in the dock all night 
[10:57] <darksydephil> and now it just won’t turn on at all 

[10:59] <darksydephil> i did not press the home button on my joycon but the power button on the switch does 
nothing 

[10:59] <darksydephil> i can try that though 
[11:01] <darksydephil> yeah nothing happens at all 

[11:01] <darksydephil> i have the switch plugged into the power cord directly so its not the dock 

[11:01] <darksydephil> pressing eithe rth ehome button on the joycon or the power button on the switch, nothing 

happens, it's dead 

[11:04] <darksydephil> yeah im looking at that too RickGrimesFanl23 

[11:04] <darksydephil> ill try it i guess 

[11:07] <darksydephil> nope nothing 

[11:07] <darksydephil> it seems to be bricked lol 

[11:07] <darksydephil> a $300 paperweight 

[11:10] <darksydephil> nothing happens at all no matter what i do. zero reaction to anything, when i dock it, the 
light on the dock goes on for a split second and then immediately turns off lol 
[11:12] <darksydephil> what the hell is a usb-c 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i dont have a usb c charger lol. who the fuck does? nothing uses that 
[11:14] <darksydephil> i own nothing that uses usb c. we have iphones and ipads here lol 
[11:14] <darksydephil> fuck delta 
[11:14] <darksydephil> tired of his dumb ass 

[11:15] <darksydephil> every day with the insults and jabs, fuck off 

[11:15] <darksydephil> bbt, what part of "the switch doesn't respond at all" didn’t you get lol 

[11:29] <darksydephil> waiting until monday? try waiting until it gets reparied, im not buying another fucking 




switch lol 

[11:30] <darksydephil> wher ethe hell is the light supposed to be on the switch? 

[11:30] <darksydephil> because nothing lights up even when its plugged in 

[11:31] <darksydephil> there is no number on the box. support is 100% online and after you answer a few 

questions it makes you create a service ticket 

[11:32] <darksydephil> nope theres no power indicator 

[11:32] <darksydephil> nothing happens at all, as ive said a million times lol 

[11:41] <darksydephil> the solution to a broken piece of hardware is not "spend more money on a longshot." lol 
[11:41] <darksydephil> im not buing another cable for it, the cable with it should be working 
[11:45] <darksydephil> is the stream working?! 

[11:45] <darksydephil> im talking and nobody is responding here 

[11:45] <darksydephil> well im streaming lol

[14:31] <darksydephil> seriously im fuming 

[14:31] <darksydephil> probably an 8 

[14:32] <darksydephil> i know what the problem is, it's that OBS is total shit, every time it had an issue i closed 
it and reopened it but it never really closed, my PC showed having it opne 4 fucking times 
[14:33] <darksydephil> bit notifications are working now so lol 

[14:33] <darksydephil> i upped the limit to 75 bits so that eddy couldn’t keep spamming 
[14:33] <darksydephil> OBS SHOULD work now, we’ll test it 
[14:33] <darksydephil> starting the stream up again now 
[14:47] <darksydephil> theres your interaction, asshole lol

[10:45] <darksydephil> there will be special notificatiosn for both subs and bits on stream 






[10:46] <darksydephil> but im wondering what the bit threshhold should be 
[10:46] <darksydephil> it's gotta be at least 50 i think to prevent spam 
[10:46] <darksydephil> wait until you see what i've got set upt! 

[10:46] <darksydephil> hello blaine 
[10:46] <darksydephil> hows it going? 

[10:48] <darksydephil> ok im about to test these messages 

[10:50] <darksydephil> happy birthday blaine! in case i dont see you before then lol 

[10:50] <darksydephil> oh yeah, ive had my channel set to auto host since the other day, wonder if it even worked 
[10:51] <darksydephil> oh okay! 

[10:51] <darksydephil> so it was working, that's great then 

[10:52] <darksydephil> yeah i set it up for 2 DS streamers, arturo and one other guy who does random stuff 
[10:52] <darksydephil> actually dargon aren't you one of them? lol 
[10:52] <darksydephil> wow nice 

[10:52] <darksydephil> i dont mind, no skin off my back to do that 

[10:54] <darksydephil> by the way, since zelda is only 900p, im recording at 720p 

[10:54] <darksydephil> because im having TONS of trouble recording at 1080p with obs for some reason, so 
fuck all that 

[10:54] <darksydephil> oh, it is?! 

[10:55] <darksydephil> well that's a no brainer then! 

[10:55] <darksydephil> i have a lot to talk about on prestream today 

[10:55] <darksydephil> 2 really positive things and one negative, and the negative thing is REALLY suspect 
[11:03] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 

[11:03] <darksydephil> prestream is going to have a lot of useful updates and info today, it sbeen an eventful 
weekend 

[11:07] <darksydephil> ok 

[11:07] <darksydephil> stream is live, can everyone see it? 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i dont care about anyone making videos about me, especially that guy. so please don’t 
bring it up in here, thanks 

[11:11] <darksydephil> did you see the bit notification? you should 

[11:11] <darksydephil> i set it up lol 

[11:11] <darksydephil> its only for 50 bits and up 

[11:11] <darksydephil> and for new subs 

[11:12] <darksydephil> yeah i dont think sound will work 

[11:12] <darksydephil> that would be too nuts i thi nk 

[11:12] <darksydephil> so yeah, special thanks to Dr Zombius who hand drew this artwork last night for the 

stream, the notifications that is 

[11:12] <darksydephil> pretty awesome of im 

[11:12] <darksydephil> im sure you'll see a lot of it lol 

[11:13] <darksydephil> people will probably spam once they see it 

[11:13] <darksydephil> ok let me tweet that we’re live 

[11:17] <darksydephil> i did update zelda 1st night, thanks Vashyoyo 

[11:17] <darksydephil> luckily someone told me about it ahead of time 

[11:35] <darksydephil> teespring.com/stores/dspgaming 

[11:55] <darksydephil> Markyl 17 how doe shtis work? 

[11:55] <darksydephil> in profile there's nothing whatsoever to back it up 
[11:55] <darksydephil> just to rename or make a new one 

[11:56] <darksydephil> i just started using OBS studio in november and didnt have these issues until this week 
[11:57] <darksydephil> anywya, im getting the update now 

[11:57] <darksydephil> you can’t test recording while streaming until you're streaming."test it before stream" 

isn't possible, genius lol 

[12:00] <darksydephil> ok messing with the updated obs, have to readjust a few settings first 
[12:01] <darksydephil> testing a recording now 




[12:01] <darksydephil> then we'll test with the steram live 
[12:03] <darksydephil> ok stream starting shortly 

[12:03] <darksydephil> mujtabal2321 how about you run the stream then? because obviously you fully 
understand tech and would never ever have a problem, right? lol 
[12:04] <darksydephil> ok stream should be coming back now 
[12:05] <darksydephil> whoa 

[12:05] <darksydephil> this OBS version seems to encode way smoother 
[12:05] <darksydephil> like, it's instantaneous now 
[12:05] <darksydephil> thats a good sign 

[12:05] <darksydephil> again, i never got a prompt to update OBS so i had no idea it needed an update 

[12:06] <darksydephil> no audio? there should be wii u audio 

[12:06] <darksydephil> its showing it in OBS 

[12:06] <darksydephil> oh ok, thanks 

[19:21] <darksydephil> by a wide margin too lol 

[19:53] <darksydephil> thanks tantamounter! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170307-01 ZELDA BOTW 2ND.LOG

[11:03] <darksydephil> so i asked in the WIP last night about keeping comments enabled on dspgaming or 
disabling them, one person responded lol

[11:10] <darksydephil> thats...1 day

[11:11] <darksydephil> "remember that update you got yesterday? it has a bunch of bugs, heres another one" 
[11:12] <darksydephil> Comcast just robot called me like 5 times to tell me service will be out from midnight to 
5am tonight, five times, five voicemails, they're pretty thorough lol 

[11:13] <darksydephil> so today ive inreased the size of the on screen notifications and moved them to the 
bottom lefthand corner 

[11:13] <darksydephil> let's see if it looks any better 
[11:15] <darksydephil> ok so stream working? ill tweet if so 
[11:15] <darksydephil> ok cool

[13:35] <darksydephil> hard reset? lol how the fuck do you do that 

[13:35] <darksydephil> sigh 

[13:37] <darksydephil> im not sure what to do her eguys 

[13:37] <darksydephil> i dont think i can stop OBS from doing this 

[13:38] <darksydephil> it worked for 2 hours, now crashes nonstop? weird 

[13:38] <darksydephil> i cant go to different software that fast, nothign is set up obviously 

[13:39] <darksydephil> ok im gonna restart again 

[13:39] <darksydephil> if it keeps crashing not much i can do 

[13:40] <darksydephil> what happeend? 

[13:40] <darksydephil> did the host stream die too? 

[13:40] <darksydephil> lolol 

[13:41] <darksydephil> see, it is OBS 

[13:41] <darksydephil> they fed it up lol 

[13:41] <darksydephil> ok i turned th estream back on 

[13:41] <darksydephil> can anyone see it? 

[13:42] <darksydephil> ok ill restart the stream again 
[13:42] <darksydephil> ok stream should be coming back now 

[13:43] <darksydephil> well we've had lots of cheers so far today, thanks for that folks 

[13:43] <darksydephil> no new subs though! wtf 

[13:44] <darksydephil> yeesh now streamlabs is screwing up! 

[13:44] <darksydephil> o hyeah ok ill go over there lol 
[14:21] <darksydephil> fucking obs 
[14:21] <darksydephil> froze again 
[14:21] <darksydephil> this is pathetic man 
[14:22] <darksydephil> you think its the long cheers? 

[14:22] <darksydephil> because yeah a long cheer was playing and it crashed 
[14:22] <darksydephil> i may have to edit it to not play messages then shit 
[14:23] <darksydephil> ok well im gonna take a break 
[14:23] <darksydephil> ill tweet about it too 
[14:23] <darksydephil> 15 mins or so then we'll restart 
[14:24] <darksydephil> i think it actually is the long messages 
[14:41] <darksydephil> ok everyone im going to restart the stream now 
[14:41] <darksydephil> however im going to test something 

[14:41] <darksydephil> im going to have it so that bit cheer message dont’ show up. just the message parts 
[14:41] <darksydephil> because i thi nk that's what s crashing obs, the lOOOONG messages from the trollls 
[14:44] <darksydephil> ok stream going live now 

[14:44] <darksydephil> yeah ithink the guys spamming the dumb messages about freedom chat actually are 

causing a browser plugin crah be their messages are so long 

[14:44] <darksydephil> and that's causing OBS to freeze 

[14:44] <darksydephil> im going to test this right now 

[14:57] <darksydephil> obs crashed again 

[14:57] <darksydephil> lol 

[14:57] <darksydephil> so its not the messages but it may be the cheers 
[14:57] <darksydephil> incidentally it crashed during a freedomchat cheer again. 

[14:58] <darksydephil> im going to completely disable the cheer messages now. we’ll try that, sigh 
[15:02] <darksydephil> yeah its the on screen messages doing it, i jus tlooked it up 

[15:02] <darksydephil> sadly i dont know how to fix this, how the fuck does everyone else stream and not have 
these issues... 

[15:03] <darksydephil> its the cheer popups causing it, the error is called cbsbootstrap.exe or something like 
that, its the browser plugin causing the crashes 
[15:06] <darksydephil> its 100% the browser plugin 



[15:06] <darksydephil> i may have to try using a new site or something, i dunno. this sucks ass 
[15:06] <darksydephil> nobody is going to cheer without the cheer messages, and thast the point of my streaming 
[15:06] <darksydephil> i wont make any money on youtube with nintendo vids because they're going to get 
claimed 

[15:07] <darksydephil> i have no idea yacherdy 

[15:07] <darksydephil> im totally new to this 

[15:09] <darksydephil> i deleted and re-added the browser source 

[15:09] <darksydephil> going to try this 

[15:10] <darksydephil> ill also hae to try muxy if this keeps up 

[15:10] <darksydephil> its the update from this morning lol 

[15:10] <darksydephil> the obs update 

[15:11] <darksydephil> everything is set to default zahvone 

[15:11] <darksydephil> framerate resolution etc i didnt mess with it 

[15:11] <darksydephil> i guess ill restart 

[15:11] <darksydephil> sigh 

[15:12] <darksydephil> no its that bootstrap.exe crashing 
[15:12] <darksydephil> it says it every time 

[15:12] <darksydephil> oh i just found three cef-bootstrap instances open in my fucking task manager 

[15:12] <darksydephil> i closed them 

[15:12] <darksydephil> maybe now it wont happen again 

[15:13] <darksydephil> oh great now they dont work at all lol 

[15:16] <darksydephil> damn all 3 of them need to be open for the on screen notifications to work 
[15:16] <darksydephil> if i close one, the test fails 
[15:18] <darksydephil> how the fuck do you reinstall it lol 
[15:18] <darksydephil> wouldn’t that delete my templates? 

[15:18] <darksydephil> im not doing that now lol 

[15:28] <darksydephil> obs crashed 

[15:28] <darksydephil> okay no more notifications i guess 

[15:29] <darksydephil> im doine with this 

[15:29] <darksydephil> yeah zahvone im going to try that now 

[15:29] <darksydephil> ok trying this differently give me a sec 

[15:31] <darksydephil> ok 

[15:31] <darksydephil> how do i get OBS to just capture this thing from streamlabs now 

[15:32] <darksydephil> window capture shows the stupid address of the thing and it doesn't fade away ever 

[15:32] <darksydephil> it'll show up as a permanent grey box lol 

[15:33] <darksydephil> yes it doesn’t fade to transparent like the browser plugin did 

[15:34] <darksydephil> yeah this is ridiculous 

[15:34] <darksydephil> everyone else on earth can stream with these notifications, but not me... 

[15:36] <darksydephil> restarting stream without any notifications

[11:02] <darksydephil> ah good 

[11:02] <darksydephil> getting set up now 

[11:03] <darksydephil> hoping muxy works better than streamlabs did. because streamlabs was shitty 
[11:04] <darksydephil> someone cheered me 2 bits at 2am lol 
[11:04] <darksydephil> i mean 10 bits lol 

[11:04] <darksydephil> muxy works better than streamlabs already as it picked that up 
[11:06] <darksydephil> there are downsides to using muxy though...sigh 
[11:06] <darksydephil> okay im gonna get set up 
[11:06] <darksydephil> give me a few minutes 




[11:13] <darksydephil> ive got so much going on its getting hard to keep track of lol 
[11:14] <darksydephil> ok starting the stream 

[11:15] <darksydephil> right now im juggling so much stuff its pretty crazy 

[11:15] <darksydephil> teespring went well for the first weekend. interested in seeing how it does this coming 
weekend hwen i add new stuff 

[11:16] <darksydephil> nier automata is 60fps so im doing 720p 
[11:18] <darksydephil> i hope OBS doesn’t constantly crash again today 
[11:19] <darksydephil> that cheer didn’t show up did it marky 
[11:20] <darksydephil> ok i know why, just fixed it 

[11:20] <darksydephil> id updated something and that changed the link which i didnt know 

[11:20] <darksydephil> its set up the same as yesterday, cheers of 50 or more will show up 

[11:21] <darksydephil> the text is more legible now too 

[11:21] <darksydephil> im actually able to mess with it in Muxy 

[11:21] <darksydephil> yes theres tips, subs and cheers 

[12:59] <darksydephil> obs crashed, sigh 

[13:00] <darksydephil> let me see what it was. i dont think it was a cheer this time at all 

[13:00] <darksydephil> yes that was not a cheer 

[13:01] <darksydephil> that was a generic OBS crash out of nowhere 

[13:01] <darksydephil> so at least its not the same issues from yesterday 

[13:02] <darksydephil> ok im going to restart 

[13:03] <darksydephil> ok stream restarting now 

[16:06] <darksydephil> NoobRydar: you're correct on the first point but not on the second, i set it up so you can

[10:54] <darksydephil> LOL WHAT 

[10:54] <darksydephil> you guys are stuck with those names now?!?! 

[10:55] <darksydephil> wow lolol 

[10:55] <darksydephil> that's quite unfortunate haha 

[10:55] <darksydephil> lesson learned i guess? 

[10:57] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 

[10:57] <darksydephil> trying to figure out how to reset muxy settings, hmm 

[11:06] <darksydephil> ok stream starting now 

[11:10] <darksydephil> stream is live and showing up for everyone? 

[11:18] <darksydephil> PoorlyMade still working on it. i can't get any concrete answers out of youtube sadly, 

because they're incredibly elusive and won’t be transparent with info as to why stuff happens, it's pretty awful 

[11:38] <darksydephil> yup it crashed lol 

[11:38] <darksydephil> im gonna restart 

[11:40] <darksydephil> ok just restarted 

[11:42] <darksydephil> is the stream back? 

[11:43] <darksydephil> lol well im streaming, sigh. 

[11:43] <darksydephil> ill restart again 
[11:43] <darksydephil> ok just restarted 
[11:50] <darksydephil> teespring.com/stores/dspgaming 
[14:24] <darksydephil> ok stream restarting now 
[14:24] <darksydephil> is the stream back? 

[14:24] <darksydephil> ok cool 




[14:58] <darksydephil> what the fuck man 

[14:59] <darksydephil> yeah its OBS crashing again sigh 

[14:59] <darksydephil> and its the same fucking bootstrap thing, AGAIN 

[15:00] <darksydephil> how the fuck does everyone on earth do these cheer message and not crash but i do? im 
lost here 

[15:00] <darksydephil> bootstrap has nothing to do with the gpu lol 
[15:00] <darksydephil> its the browser plugin, it keeps fucking crashing 
[15:01] <darksydephil> both muxy and streamlabs crash the browser plugin the same way 
[15:02] <darksydephil> nothing you guys are suggesting will help lol 

[15:02] <darksydephil> if a plugin keeps crashing, none of any of the suggesitions will magically fix a buggy 
plugin 

[15:04] <darksydephil> i restarted the stream 

[15:04] <darksydephil> im going to have to reinstall OBS tonight i think 
[15:04] <darksydephil> dunno what else to do, and doubt it'll even help 
[15:43] <darksydephil> i have to fucking restart the stream again lolol 
[15:43] <darksydephil> what in the holy hell 
[15:44] <darksydephil> brb

[10:50] <darksydephil> hold on folks 

[10:51] <darksydephil> dspgaming was just released 

[10:51] <darksydephil> give me a sec to see how this process works 

[10:53] <darksydephil> okay 

[10:53] <darksydephil> so DSPGaming is free from Machinima as of right now 

[10:53] <darksydephil> and I Just signed all paperwork to finalize with the new company 

[10:55] <darksydephil> okay so yeah, there's nothing more to do on my part here. The new company has to do 

stuff internally and then DSPGaming will be with them, so just gotta wait on them, luckily this happened earlier 

in the day 

[10:56] <darksydephil> HOPEFULLY it processes today, would suck to have an entire weekend without 
monetization 

[10:56] <darksydephil> well, yes and no 

[10:57] <darksydephil> for a while i had a great relationship with them and made a lot of money, it's too bad 
they changed so much for the worse and never recovered 
[10:57] <darksydephil> no i'm not 

[10:57] <darksydephil> i still have 2 other channels partnered with them lol 

[10:57] <darksydephil> have to wait for those to expire. KOGaming doesn't until early april 

[10:58] <darksydephil> yup but thats only for a few more days 

[10:58] <darksydephil> that channel honestly does not need to be in any partnership program, its just talking to a 

camera, totally safe for copyright 

[10:59] <darksydephil> to some extent PoorlyMade 

[10:59] <darksydephil> you get assistance with copyright issues etc 

[10:59] <darksydephil> content ID is iffy, it all depends on whose actually claiming it etc 

[11:00] <darksydephil> ive heard that most content ID matches now get cleared up for the most part 

[11:00] <darksydephil> since YouTube changed last year that is 

[11:00] <darksydephil> honestly the reason im partnering DSPGaming with someone is in the hopes that in a bit 
i can upgrade to a managed partnership 

[11:00] <darksydephil> i dont think id be a big fish anywhere, lol 

[11:03] <darksydephil> self monetization is INCREDIBLY risky, especially for someone like me. tons of ways 
to fuck the system up and youtube doesn’t have it. just look at what happened with THEKINGOFHATEHD in 




2010. same shit can happen now 

[11:03] <darksydephil> at least with a partner network you've got some clout and protection, it’d be one thing if i 
had a channel that was just starting, but an already established channel w/o a partner network, especially one 
doing gameplay, is a big risk 

[11:06] <darksydephil> ok stream starting in a moment 

[11:06] <darksydephil> btw this is a fresh install of OBS studio now 

[11:07] <darksydephil> if we still have tech issues today, im stumped and screwed, i can’t go to xsplit be i need a 

program that can record at one quality and stream at another and i dont think it can do that 

[11:07] <darksydephil> that's why i moved from OBS to OBS studio in the first place 

[11:08] <darksydephil> lol its not my OS. ive said it a million times, its the browser plugin for OBS called 

cef-bootstrapper.exe 

[11:08] <darksydephil> it crashes constantly 
[11:08] <darksydephil> well the test cheer worked 
[11:09] <darksydephil> thanks blaine! 

[11:09] <darksydephil> stream is live, yes? 

[11:10] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[11:11] <darksydephil> well these streams are where it's at now 

[11:12] <darksydephil> doing my best LukOss , its defnitely an adjustment process 

[11:12] <darksydephil> very different from what ive done for 8_ years 

[11:12] <darksydephil> blowing my nose right now 

[11:12] <darksydephil> then we'll start lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> stuart, that's the thing, im not doing old school playthroughs anymore, they'r enot 
working, sadly, so things have to change 

[11:14] <darksydephil> either adapt or die. id prefer to keep doing this as a job 
[11:14] <darksydephil> late? im right here 
[11:14] <darksydephil> going to tweet that we’re live right now 
[11:14] <darksydephil> lol vendatus isn’t it snowed in there? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> teespring.com/stores/dspgaming 
[16:04] <darksydephil> Shiroakiama : don't be a moron, thanks 
[16:05] <darksydephil> thanks see you later! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170311-01 NIER AUTOMATA 2ND.LOG 

[11:04] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:04] <darksydephil> so good news and bad news, as it may effect the stream 

[11:04] <darksydephil> good news is my new partnership went through overnight and for the last 6+ hours 

youtube has been bulk enabling ads on my videos again 

[11:05] <darksydephil> its currently up to 38k+ ad enabled and still going lol 

[11:05] <darksydephil> bad is, i’m nervous that Google chrome is going to crash lol 

[11:05] <darksydephil> because OBS Studio uses it for the cheers and such 

[11:05] <darksydephil> so now its already maxed out doing this process, imagine what will happen when the on 
screen cheers appear lol 

[11:06] <darksydephil> im going to close a bunch of browser tabs in the hope it doesn't crash today 

[11:10] <darksydephil> okay setting up now 

[11:10] <darksydephil> fingers crossed nothing goes wrong 

[11:13] <darksydephil> ok setting up now 

[11:13] <darksydephil> good call eternia forever 

[11:13] <darksydephil> kind of interesting to see people compete for top cheer daily 

[11:14] <darksydephil> ps4 system update required, god damn it 

[11:14] <darksydephil> there must be a limit 

[11:14] <darksydephil> likei doubt you could cheer $10k lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> but maybe im wrong 

[11:15] <darksydephil> $500 in one pop, damn 




[11:15] <darksydephil> thats the serious gravy train there lol 

[11:16] <darksydephil> a $1000 bit cheer 

[11:16] <darksydephil> youza 

[11:16] <darksydephil> of course his hair was dyed 

[11:16] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:19] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:19] <darksydephil> there will always be an unlimited supply of dumb horny dudes to throw money at 
women they'll never get 

[11:19] <darksydephil> at least throwing money at me, you know you're paying for ongoing daily content 
[11:20] <darksydephil> requests? like suggestions for new shirts? 

[11:20] <darksydephil> of course 

[11:20] <darksydephil> yes please 

[11:21] <darksydephil> thanks retro and DineNasty ! 

[11:21] <darksydephil> started already before im even doing anything lol 

[11:22] <darksydephil> rbreezy people seem to say that teespring is pretty damned good quality, and im picking 
the premium tshirts, not the el cheapo ones despite the fact that i make less on them 
[11:23] <darksydephil> oh is the stream working for all? 

[11:23] <darksydephil> if so ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:23] <darksydephil> ok great

[14:23] <darksydephil> Zahvone i dont even really know what revlo is yet. i may try i teventually but ill right 
now just trying to get the hang of the new streaming style 
[14:27] <darksydephil> [teespring 

[16:11] <darksydephil> this game is the opposite of boring lol 

[16:12] <darksydephil> its quirky, its crazy, its got wacky stuff and high adrenaline gameplay. if you think the 

game is boring, you're boring lol 

[16:16] <darksydephil> hey all 

[16:16] <darksydephil> big reminder 

[16:16] <darksydephil> somethign i forgot about 

[16:16] <darksydephil> daylight saving time starts overnight

[16:16] <darksydephil> 1 lam PDT 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170312-01 ZELDA BOTW 5TH.LOG 

[10:57] <darksydephil> hello all 

[10:58] <darksydephil> dunno why you thought i’d be late, im the one that emphasized daylight saving time 
[10:59] <darksydephil> why is she eating in front of a mic? lol 
[11:00] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:00] <darksydephil> well then, new idea: shit and stream!

[11:01] <darksydephil> ok setting up stream now, almost ready 

[11:01] <darksydephil> i wonder how many will be late today, im guessing a bunch of people 
[11:03] <darksydephil> the page will host until i go live, which im about to do 

[11:04] <darksydephil> by the way, it's confirmed ill make no money on zelda at all on YT. the vids get auto 
claimed as they go live 

[11:04] <darksydephil> so gotta keep the streams profitable here or else no more nintendo. sucks, i know. 

[11:04] <darksydephil> i also wont ever be doing impressions or reviews on nintendo games be i cant monetize 
them 

[11:05] <darksydephil> if Zelda or any nintendo game makes it to my game of hte year awards, ill have to award

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170313-02 NIER AUTOMATA 3RD FINALE.LOG 

[18:52] <darksydephil> hello, anyone around? 

[18:52] <darksydephil> cool! Setting up the nier stream right now 

[18:53] <darksydephil> also looks like the new partnership on DSPGaming is already working, got results for 
Saturday's views and looks to be on part with what it was w/machinima so 

[18:53] <darksydephil> i was told the 2nd playthrough is almost identical to the first except it's a new charater, 
that it was the 3rd thats actually different 

[18:55] <darksydephil> Nintendo would probably feel that way, because they’re a bunch of elitists and always 
have been. 

[18:55] <darksydephil> they don’t understand valid criticism. 

[18:55] <darksydephil> just like their fanboys lol 

[18:57] <darksydephil> that would be because they chose to watch a montage of the extreme things ive done 
instead of the tons of game playthroughs wher ei enjoye dtheir games, just like those who only watch hateful 
videos about me instead of the 40k+ positive ones 

[18:57] <darksydephil> you have to show some actual intelligence to get the truth onthe internet sometimes 
[18:57] <darksydephil> sadly, you can't force anyone to be smart 
[18:59] <darksydephil> guess what? 

[18:59] <darksydephil> got a new on screen notification for subs! 

[18:59] <darksydephil> its full color and funny 
[19:00] <darksydephil> im gonna test it now 
[19:00] <darksydephil> there we go lol 
[19:00] <darksydephil> di you see it? 

[19:00] <darksydephil> did 

[19:01] <darksydephil> another one from dr zombius 
[19:01] <darksydephil> he's pumping them out lol 
[19:01] <darksydephil> hello! 

[19:02] <darksydephil> darkmaggot rarely does stuff, but he still does from tiem to time 

[19:02] <darksydephil> ok so stream is working for everyone? once again its not on my dashboard, stupid twitch 
[19:02] <darksydephil> i clicked on my ytmnd 
[19:02] <darksydephil> lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170314 DAY OFF.LOG 

[14:19] <darksydephil> im here for a sec as im setting uploads on DSPGaming 
[14:19] <darksydephil> whats up? 

[14:19] <darksydephil> ok? 

[14:20] <darksydephil> yes, well, it's 3 copyright strikes that lead to the channel being suspended, if any of those 
strikes get cleared, the suspension is lifted 

[14:21] <darksydephil> but if they dont get cleared, it basically locks the channel until they are 
[14:21] <darksydephil> if you get more than 3 strikes, you're pretty fucked 
[14:21] <darksydephil> np 

[14:21] <darksydephil> btw just updated teh channel info so people aren't confused that theres no stream today 
[14:22] <darksydephil> yeah but im still uploading before we head out for the day 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170315-01 ZELDA BOTW 7TH.LOG 

[11:01] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:02] <darksydephil> geez 

[11:02] <darksydephil> seems the snowstorm either decimated people or completely missed them 

[11:02] <darksydephil> back home in bridgeport it was supposed to be 2 feet, they only got 5 inches and it 

washed away with rain afterwards lol 

[11:02] <darksydephil> snowtober 

[11:02] <darksydephil> i remember that lol 

[11:05] <darksydephil> ok setting up now, live shortly 






[11:06] <darksydephil> i just realized 

[11:06] <darksydephil> theres gonna be a LOT of zelda these next few days 
[11:06] <darksydephil> its basically zelda on stream until we start with mass effect 
[11:06] <darksydephil> so...maybe ill beat it. who knows 
[11:07] <darksydephil> aw some on 

[11:07] <darksydephil> ME2 and 3 were some of my classic playthroughs 
[11:07] <darksydephil> huh? 

[11:07] <darksydephil> what would be the status on the switch? 

[11:07] <darksydephil> i returned it over a week ago 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i already explained, theres nothing to play on it right now besides zelda. that wont 
change for quite a long time 

[11:08] <darksydephil> so why would i be looking to get a new one now? 

[11:09] <darksydephil> mario kart is 3 years old lol 

[11:09] <darksydephil> blaster master is 30 years old. baffles the mind why they’re bringing that one back 
[11:10] <darksydephil> and its already been out for a year 
[11:10] <darksydephil> i think you're seeing my point by now lol 

[11:11] <darksydephil> theres no reason whatsoever to buy a switch right now unless you're an active early 
adopter or just want to get footage of it having a hardware failure lol 

[11:13] <darksydephil> id be disappointed about not getting to play Ultra SF2 if it wasn't just HD remix with 2 
palette swap characters nobody will use, on an awful control scheme lol. but after just holding those joycons, i 
know the game will control like shit, and spending 80 bucks for a pro pad or over 100 for ajoystick for that game 
is a total ripofff 

[11:14] <darksydephil> the pro controller being 80 bucks literally means 70 bucks profit for nintendo. that thing 
is a cheap pos 

[11:15] <darksydephil> hello blaine 

[11:15] <darksydephil> is the stream working btw? 

[11:15] <darksydephil> sup errnoent 

[11:16] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet that we're live then 
[11:19] <darksydephil> ok removing top cheer from monday 
[11:19] <darksydephil> let's see who the top cheer leader will be today 
[11:20] <darksydephil> whew! 

[11:20] <darksydephil> holy shit 

[11:20] <darksydephil> just took a sip of my new V8 drink 

[11:20] <darksydephil> its strong as hell lol 

[11:20] <darksydephil> 34% juice so its not just sugar 

[11:24] <darksydephil> its going well 

[11:24] <darksydephil> happy to be here today 

[11:24] <darksydephil> good to be back 

[11:24] <darksydephil> nothing too exciting, errands mostly, and checked out the new huge ikea they just built 
here 

[11:25] <darksydephil> isnt walking dead the last week of this month? 

[11:25] <darksydephil> and yeah theycallmejimbob pretty much all WWE vids are now being claimed, so unless 

i get a managed partnership, i cant play that series anymore 

[11:26] <darksydephil> its dead on arrival now 

[11:26] <darksydephil> gino, did you not see my tweet last night

[11:16] <darksydephil> yeah, i decided that paying extra to play ME andromeda for 10 hours and then having to 
wait until next week anyway, while being stuck with teh xb 1 version, wasn’t a good idea 
[11:17] <darksydephil> advertisement isn’t begging

[10:59] <darksydephil> looking forward to more zelda, so awesome the game is so huge in scale and has so 
much to do 

[11:00] <darksydephil> btw ive now received six new designs for teespring. thinking about reducing the product 
line a bit over the weekend and adding 1-2 new designs a week for the next few weeks to keep people interested 





[11:00] <darksydephil> whoa, i just noticed i have 206 subscribers now! first time ive ever had over 200 i believe 
[11:00] <darksydephil> even back when i was using this channel full time in 2013-2014 i dont thi nk i had that 
many 

[11:02] <darksydephil> thanks very much! 

[11:02] <darksydephil> and y eah, twitch is definitely the in thing for gaming right now. youtube is on the way 

out, mostly because of their bullshit business practices 

[11:03] <darksydephil> sup Derich 

[11:03] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:03] <darksydephil> exactly my point 

[11:03] <darksydephil> that thing died almost instantly, they never actually promoted it nor gave ar eason to use 
it 

[11:03] <darksydephil> its a joke 

[11:04] <darksydephil> MLB will probably be a funt hing to balance with all the other releases over april, but i 

am worried the PT will suck with no music 

[11:04] <darksydephil> damn 

[11:04] <darksydephil> well welcome back jack! 

[11:04] <darksydephil> things have changed fyi

[10:54] <darksydephil> youtube still hasn’t updated to tell me if it's made any money, the ads are definitely 
working though 

[10:56] <darksydephil> i get the feeling something is wrong 
[10:56] <darksydephil> but there's no way to get help 
[10:56] <darksydephil> normal adsense partners have no help whatsoever 
[11:02] <darksydephil> aha! 

[11:02] <darksydephil> i figured it out! 

[11:02] <darksydephil> someone a year ago figured out the issue with adsense lol

[11:01] <darksydephil> let's see if it looks better, probably not since the game is only 720p anyway 
[11:02] <darksydephil> mass effect andromeda is 30fps correct? 

[11:02] <darksydephil> should be interesting to see how that streams at 6kbps tonight, and ill be 

recording/streaming that in 1080p 

[11:03] <darksydephil> okay im gonna start the stream 

[11:04] <darksydephil> well i used to stream at 8-9k on youtube so this should work fine, fingers crossed lol

[12:21] <darksydephil> and no its not a DDOS, that im aware of, because the modem didn’t turn off completely

[11:09] <darksydephil> but im streaming at 6 

[11:09] <darksydephil> yes, they changed their rules on Sunday to double the bandwidth

estate agent etc 






[19:20] <darksydephil> nope, sadly, things did not go well with the short sale attempt lol 

[19:20] <darksydephil> as in, it looks like both sides (both the mortgage company and real estate comapny) are 

idiots and it probably can’t happen 

[19:20] <darksydephil> but that's neither here nor there, has nothing to do with the stream, just sucks it delayed it 
[19:21] <darksydephil> theres no way to sell it. i owe over 100k on it and its only worth 60k lol. thats the 
problem

[11:04] <darksydephil> next week will be awesome i thi nk 
[11:04] <darksydephil> im really getting hype now 

[11:08] <darksydephil> Maybe I'll do a midnight release for Persona 5 if its actually getting one. i'll have to look 
into that 

[11:08] <darksydephil> actually i take that back 
[11:08] <darksydephil> monday is my day off lol 
[11:08] <darksydephil> so no midnight release 

[11:09] <darksydephil> yeah, im ready to be chased by more guys with giant cheese knives 
[11:10] <darksydephil> Danganronpa continues tonight actually 
[11:11] <darksydephil> Well Zelda is almost done, FINALLY 

[11:11] <darksydephil> like 1-2 sessions tops and its done, and thats on my agenda as soon as i finish dark souls 




Ill 

[11:13] <darksydephil> ok cheer resetting 

[11:13] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:13] <darksydephil> cool! ill tweet that we're live then 

[11:16] <darksydephil> its not the same thing, i dont think 

[11:16] <darksydephil> i wasn't flagged for any kindof ad unfriendly stuff 

[11:16] <darksydephil> and as ive said, since leaving machinima, its going back up now 

[11:17] <darksydephil> at this point i have to think it has something to do with machinima 

[11:17] <darksydephil> which is pretty fucking sad. an old school network that i was with for 6 years ended up 

screwing me over somehow

[11:08] <darksydephil> hello! 

[11:09] <darksydephil> setting up now, should be live shortly 
[11:10] <darksydephil> ive got the full skinny nothing4thebest 

[11:10] <darksydephil> i figured it all out overnight, my situation is a complete oversight of course lol 
[11:10] <darksydephil> had to shut down the shop until they figure it out and fix it 
[11:11] <darksydephil> remastered? lol 
[11:11] <darksydephil> you mean the remake 

[11:13] <darksydephil> ugh, so many fools re creaming their pants for the Destiny 2 announcement today 
[11:13] <darksydephil> its such a non announcement lol 

[11:13] <darksydephil> it'll be the same fucking game, it'll be overhyped and underwhelming, you'll have to buy 
the game 3 times to get something good 

[11:14] <darksydephil> also the announcement that destiny 2 is on PC, people are freaking out 

[11:14] <darksydephil> PC already has far better games lol 

[11:15] <darksydephil> ok just started the stream 

[11:15] <darksydephil> gonna grab some drinks, brb 

[11:19] <darksydephil> testing 

[11:20] <darksydephil> can you guys see this? 

[11:20] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[11:20] <darksydephil> was having issues with the laptop again 

[11:21] <darksydephil> the biggest challenge in dark souls altogether is the camera, lol 
[11:21] <darksydephil> its awful. Nioh did it so much better 

[11:21] <darksydephil> Nioh massively exposed the issues with the DS series. From Software is going to have to 
up its game 

[11:22] <darksydephil> crap my speakers are on 

[11:22] <darksydephil> let me fix that and then we'll start 

[15:58] <darksydephil> thanks all for a great final dark souls stream! Had a blast, happy to beat that dragon lol 

[16:27] <darksydephil> LOL 

[16:27] <darksydephil> i left it streaming, oops 

[16:27] <darksydephil> that wasn't intentional, thought i’d closed OBS. oops 

[16:28] <darksydephil> yup that was me playing the vids so i can title them properly for youtube as they upload
