-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170502-01 NIOH DLC1 1ST.LOG 

[11:04] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:04] <darksydephil> well we have progress today thank god 
[11:05] <darksydephil> both channels are currently in review status 
[11:05] <darksydephil> meaning DSPGaming is UN-stuck 

[11:05] <darksydephil> but yeah, still in review so no ads YET. but we'll see how long it takes them 
[11:06] <darksydephil> yes new EW emote! lol 
[11:06] <darksydephil> i love it 

[11:06] <darksydephil> i can still get 3 more i think, let me check actually 

[11:07] <darksydephil> theycallmejimbob : literally yesterday, it started May 1 

[11:07] <darksydephil> so nobody knew about it until i ran into it 

[11:07] <darksydephil> yes I can still get 3 more emotes! nice 

[11:09] <darksydephil> jwalker70 yes, im considering everything 

[11:09] <darksydephil> we’ll see what happens 

[11:09] <darksydephil> BTW im downloading the nioh DLC. it wasn’t availble at all last night 
[11:09] <darksydephil> so gotta do it now 

[11:10] <darksydephil> just waiting on the DLC to download dolks 

[11:11] <darksydephil> i dont know cherry be its doing one of those "preparing to download" percentage deals 
instead of showing hte actual download 
[11:11] <darksydephil> listen up dolks! lol 
[11:11] <darksydephil> thanks Markyl 17 

[11:11] <darksydephil> theres no way i can wreck everything BeTheAllen , i havent played this in over 2 

months, im bound to suck haha 

[11:12] <darksydephil> dadies and dendlemen 

[11:13] <darksydephil> yes, im obviously incredibly drunk at 1 lam lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i dunno how you could do a drunk "event." being drunk for extended periods of time 
isn’t good for you 

[11:15] <darksydephil> I would KingjadVCMP but not for a long ass time, maybe a couple of hours here or there 
and then i’d sober up by the end. that's how i played a lot of the fallout dies 
[11:16] <darksydephil> what?? 

[11:16] <darksydephil> seriously Popsicolo ? 

[11:16] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:16] <darksydephil> must be a twitch database error 

[11:18] <darksydephil> well, we just BARELY hit the Patreon goal for april. as in, by a few dollars...sigh 
[11:18] <darksydephil> that's what happens, a lot of people who were pledged to Patreon probably came over to 
twitch to support here and then pulled their pledges 

[11:19] <darksydephil> dunno how many times ive said that won’t work... 

[11:19] <darksydephil> it's cool though, because twitch has been really good, i need to find something to get 
people interested in patreon again 

[11:19] <darksydephil> cherry they lower them or pull them during the middle of the month 
[11:19] <darksydephil> a LOT of people lowered their pledges last minute 





[11:21] <darksydephil> yeah pretty much everything is an auto-subscription encelor . twitch, patreon, lootcrate 
etc. 

[11:23] <darksydephil> KingjadVCMP you have to put it into perspective, its not me being ungrateful, its being 

frustrated at the entire situation, for months ive been saying "dont take the twitch success for granted, i still need 

patreon support" and then this month i see hundreds of dollars of patreon funding pulled, JUST to coincide with 

youtube f ing me over and now im making no money over there, see what i’m saying? it's hard to not be human 

here, i’m grateful but still frustrated at the situation 

[11:24] <darksydephil> ok looks like the DLC is finally installed 

[11:24] <darksydephil> sorry for late start all, ill get the stream going now 

[11:27] <darksydephil> okay

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170503-01 NIOH DLC1 2ND.LOG 

[11:07] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:07] <darksydephil> oh?? 

[11:08] <darksydephil> yeah that's not abusing the game 
[11:10] <darksydephil> ok, this guy won’t get hosted anymore lol 
[11:10] <darksydephil> im doing him a fucking favor and he's gonna talk shit 
[11:10] <darksydephil> that's the definition of a moron 

[11:11] <darksydephil> yeah but i have to find the stupid page for it, its hiden somewhere in twitch settings 
[11:12] <darksydephil> i just removed him, so once my stream starts, he won’t get hosted again 
[11:14] <darksydephil> by the way 

[11:14] <darksydephil> KOGaming was approved for monetization 

[11:14] <darksydephil> gotta tell the new network asap 

[11:14] <darksydephil> DSPGaming not yet, probably because its 43k videos 

[11:18] <darksydephil> Uber is great for healthy people, not people with bad backs, one of the reasons my back 

is better is because i dont drive much, ive said this a bunch of times too, but apparently people don't listen 

[11:19] <darksydephil> man i need some eyedrops, they were just cutting hte grass outside and now my eyes are 

burning up a storm 

[11:19] <darksydephil> brb 

[11:20] <darksydephil> allergies

[11:31] <darksydephil> ok time to talk 
[12:20] <darksydephil> spoiler? is there a legit spoiler? 

[12:20] <darksydephil> from which persona??? 

[12:20] <darksydephil> ok i wont read it then, who said it? 

[12:36] <darksydephil> yeah, you might want to stop trying to cause drama by talking about scams 
[12:36] <darksydephil> or esle you'll be banned 
[12:36] <darksydephil> thanks 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170503-02 DANGANRONPA 2ND.LOG 

[18:39] <darksydephil> thanks Retro! 

[18:40] <darksydephil> lol 

[18:41] <darksydephil> ill be setting up danganronpa in a minute 

[18:41] <darksydephil> in fact let me get my water refilled now 

[18:45] <darksydephil> yeah i saw a tweet saying there’s only 3-4 hours left 

[18:45] <darksydephil> thats great news 

[18:53] <darksydephil> lol what is that emote supposed to be 

[18:53] <darksydephil> looks like a barely conscious guy 

[18:54] <darksydephil> got some minor bad news tonight for everyone 

[18:54] <darksydephil> LootCrate numbers have been pretty bad w/referrals and the like, so they're putting my 
partnership on hold for a bit 

[18:55] <darksydephil> i dont blame them, they send me like 3 crates a month now and almost nobody is really 





doing the referall stuff anymore 

[18:55] <darksydephil> they said they want to start again in the summer perhaps and see if the stagger will get 
people interested again 

[18:56] <darksydephil> i make like, maybe $50 every three months lol 

[18:56] <darksydephil> at first it was huge, because everyone was interested and signed up and then it just 
slowed down bigtime 

[18:56] <darksydephil> yeah it won’t have any real effect on me financially, but sucks as those unboxings were 
fun videos for the vlogging channel 
[18:57] <darksydephil> delightful lol 

[18:58] <darksydephil> nobody seems to agree how much danganronpa is left lol 
[18:59] <darksydephil> im doing well thanks 

[19:00] <darksydephil> a bit hot in the office but cooling down as the sun is going down now 

[19:00] <darksydephil> Danganronpa is a 2 game collection on ps4 for i think 30 bucks? a great price IMO 

[19:01] <darksydephil> i haven't set up the air conditioner yet. trying to hold off as long as possible before i 

make a big jump in energy cost lol 

[19:01] <darksydephil> ok stream working well? 

[19:02] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet that we're live 
[19:03] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that were live 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170504-01 PERSONA 5 16TH.LOG 

[11:10] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:10] <darksydephil> finally here, sorry for being late 

[11:10] <darksydephil> it seems everything wants to happen when i need to start a stream or during one lol 
[11:11] <darksydephil> DSPGaming was approved for monetization 
[11:12] <darksydephil> so trying to contact people and mass enabling ads etc 
[11:19] <darksydephil> can you guys do me a favor? 

[11:19] <darksydephil> unless you have definitive proof of wrongdoing, stop spreading rumors like little girls 
[11:20] <darksydephil> the problem is, people LOVE to create drama where it doesn't exist 
[11:20] <darksydephil> let me say this 

[11:21] <darksydephil> how do you think the MCN feels when it's trying to recruit YouTubers, they sign me, 

and in the first day you've got a bunch of dumb people saying they're a scam??? You're hurting both me and the 

MCN by spreading rumors without proof, so STFU 

[11:21] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:21] <darksydephil> setting up the stream now 

[11:22] <darksydephil> should be live shortly 

[11:23] <darksydephil> by the way 

[11:23] <darksydephil> it's confirmed that youtube is demonetizing videos by keywords, as stupid as that sounds 
[11:23] <darksydephil> one of my vids of Sunset Overdrive is titled Deep Throat, got demonetized lol 
[11:24] <darksydephil> yup 

[11:24] <darksydephil> one video in my Mafia III playthrough has KKK in the title, because i'm fighting the 
KKK 

[11:24] <darksydephil> demonetized! 

[11:25] <darksydephil> yes theycallmejimbob 
[11:25] <darksydephil> that's exactly correct 
[11:26] <darksydephil> yes 

[11:26] <darksydephil> call of duty youtubers are trying to cover COD WWII and all of their videos are getting 
demonetized, they’re going out of business 

[11:27] <darksydephil> its not because of the violence, its because it has WWII in teh title and youtube's NEW 

algorithm deems world war ii as advertiser unfriendly lol 

[11:27] <darksydephil> yes, there's a kotaku article about it today 

[11:28] <darksydephil> AscensionShock the article is based on facts from big COD youtubers. are you stupid? 
[11:30] <darksydephil> bigtone995 if you're seeing double chat messages, it's an HTML bug. refresh and it 




should fix itself 

[11:30] <darksydephil> AscensionShock : more money and eventual managed partnership 
[11:31] <darksydephil> it's in my contract 
[11:32] <darksydephil> um, what? 

[11:32] <darksydephil> what are you talking about lol 
[11:32] <darksydephil> thanks bigtone995 
[11:32] <darksydephil> oh my god 

[11:33] <darksydephil> enough of this talk lol. you’re super annoying 

[11:33] <darksydephil> nothing, this guy is just getting on my nerves 

[11:33] <darksydephil> trying to set up a stream and getting interrogated by a kid 

[11:33] <darksydephil> you've asked a dozen questions so far 

[11:33] <darksydephil> want my blood type and SSN too? 

[11:34] <darksydephil> people should just be happy the stream is getting up and running 
[11:34] <darksydephil> that's the important focus right now lol 
[11:34] <darksydephil> so, stream working for everyone? 

[11:35] <darksydephil> i get that pcgamehunter but you have to understand, not everything is public knowledge, 
i’ll disclose what i can when i can. no need to interrogate me like i'm a murder suspect when i'm trying to set up a 
stream lol 

[11:35] <darksydephil> okay im going to tweet that we’ re live 
[11:40] <darksydephil> ok back and about to start prestream 
[11:41] <darksydephil> huh? 

[11:41] <darksydephil> this is persona 5 

[11:41] <darksydephil> why are people talking about danganronpa? 

[11:41] <darksydephil> oh ok, as long as people weren't under the impression this was danganropa lol 

[14:14] <darksydephil> but thsoe videos are garbage 

[14:14] <darksydephil> like 4 second clips lol 

[16:10] <darksydephil> oops

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170504-02 DANGANRONPA 3RD.LOG 

[18:35] <darksydephil> i'm starting to get a pretty sizeable amount of daily follows now, very nice 
[18:52] <darksydephil> I'm playing Prey all day tomorrow, not tonight 
[18:52] <darksydephil> 2 streams, although the first one will be an hour shorter than usaul 
[18:58] <darksydephil> ok setting up in a sec 

[19:00] <darksydephil> I think that Mukuro or whoever was working in cahoots with someone else, as they 
explained last night: ultimate despair isn't just one person, so it was the both of them controlling monokuma up to 
a point, but now that Mukuro is dead (we think) it's probably the other remaining person, but i dunno who the 
hell that is 

[19:05] <darksydephil> i've got something new on teespring to show you guys on stream tonight! 

[19:09] <darksydephil> thanks kingwhiterabbit !

[18:39] <darksydephil> yes, I am 

[18:49] <darksydephil> the dealer situation went incredibly well, our credit got us a really good promotion and 
its going to lower our monthly car payment by a minimum of $200 if not more, pretty pleased right now 
[18:49] <darksydephil> id rather not talk about the car until we have it though 

[18:59] <darksydephil> if you can qualify with your credit, the incentives on buying a new car are absolutely 
insane 

[19:00] <darksydephil> 0% financing for 72 months, plus 2 years free maintenance lol. what the holy hell 

[19:00] <darksydephil> you need at least good credit though 

[19:04] <darksydephil> no credit is worse than bad credit, this is correct 

[19:04] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:04] <darksydephil> setting up for tonights 2nd stream now 

[19:12] <darksydephil> prey is good so far, albeit a bit challenging considering i dont have any real weapons yet 
[19:13] <darksydephil> gotta open up that fabrication area to make that nail gun ASAP, or mayb ethere will be 
guns in security 

[19:13] <darksydephil> Leanna is asleep. She worked from 6 am to 3pm and then went to the car dealership for 2 
hours with me. she wants nothing but to leep right now lol

[10:59] <darksydephil> ok setting up stream now 
[11:01] <darksydephil> today will be great 

[11:01] <darksydephil> Prey now, Danganronpa finally concludes later 

[11:03] <darksydephil> Every time I get a big tip, a troll cries salty salty tears 

[11:03] <darksydephil> that should become a meme 

[11:04] <darksydephil> big tips are never given by trolls 

[11:06] <darksydephil> maybe ill up the requirement to at least $2 

[11:06] <darksydephil> because ive seen a lot of spammed $1 tips 

[11:07] <darksydephil> ok i changed it to a $2 tip requirement 

[11:08] <darksydephil> btw you can now cheer on mobile 

[11:08] <darksydephil> but you cant' buy the bits on mobile 

[11:08] <darksydephil> so...lol 

[11:09] <darksydephil> they created custom bit emotes for cheers in excess of 1000 i think, not 100% sure 
[11:09] <darksydephil> so instead of those dancing jewels you can have anything you want 
[11:10] <darksydephil> ok stream working for everyone? 

[11:10] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:11] <darksydephil> i could do that, maybe once a week do verbal thank-yous on a prestream etc

[19:15] <darksydephil> ok stream starting now 

[19:19] <darksydephil> thanks Zahvone ! 

[19:22] <darksydephil> is the stream working folks? 

[19:22] <darksydephil> ok good, ill tweet that we’re live 
[19:25] <darksydephil> okay, enough of that 
[19:25] <darksydephil> anybody else? 

[19:27] <darksydephil> I like how Hina is physically impossible to be who she is. No skinny girl with giant 
boobs like that can be a great athlete because it causes you to be top loaded and off balance. She’d have to be 
built like the Williams sisters to support those things and still be athletic

[11:01] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:03] <darksydephil> test 

[11:04] <darksydephil> who's ready for more Prey? 

[11:04] <darksydephil> im good TheNewFaceofCreation 






[11:05] <darksydephil> we just got the Psi abilities so im expecting the game to pick up bigtime 
[11:06] <darksydephil> thats not really controllable is it? 

[11:06] <darksydephil> all i can do is make a team of my fans 

[11:06] <darksydephil> and then rely on the matchmaking to somehow let them find us 
[11:06] <darksydephil> doesn’t sound very fullproof 
[11:07] <darksydephil> thanks theCommodOre ! 

[11:07] <darksydephil> we’re back up to 227 subs now 
[11:07] <darksydephil> a slow creep back up lol 
[11:08] <darksydephil> so FYI a few things are in flux 

[11:08] <darksydephil> i screwed up and forgot to click a certain box so for the last 3 days, i haven’t made as 
much money on YT as i normally would with ads enabled, because of one f ing box. but now its checked off and 
i think things are good 

[11:09] <darksydephil> we’ll see as i need more data, and it takes like 2 or more days for stuff to update so i can 
actually see the results 

[11:10] <darksydephil> if you haven’t noticed, i haven’t talked about any MCN. that's completely on purpose. 

which is why that podcast last night was completely irrelevant and a joke, a bunch of completely misinformed 

dumbfucks. when i’m ready to announce what i’m doing i will do so 

[11:10] <darksydephil> twitch is telling me i have 0 viewers right now. that is suspect lol 

[11:11] <darksydephil> probbaly just my dashboard lagging, not a surprise 

[11:12] <darksydephil> ok stream working nicely? 

[11:13] <darksydephil> it SHOULD be working by now lol 
[11:14] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:14] <darksydephil> oh yeah, ill turn that off theycallmejimbob 
[11:14] <darksydephil> no need for that anymore 
[11:14] <darksydephil> danganronpa is over! 

[11:14] <darksydephil> that was a fun/unique one 

[11:15] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna grab drinks 

[11:20] <darksydephil> why are people still gossiping? lol 

[11:20] <darksydephil> let me put it this way 

[11:20] <darksydephil> i have partnership situation well in hand 

[11:20] <darksydephil> if i wanted to talk about it i would 

[11:20] <darksydephil> stop being so damn nosy! lol 

[11:21] <darksydephil> KingjadVCMP : that's not what im talking about, im talking about hte crazy gossip about 
whose behind an MCN and all kinds of info that's completely superfluous because it's wrong, i swear to god 
people think i don’t know what i'm doing 

[11:22] <darksydephil> all you need to do is watch the videos/streams and enjoy, that's it. everything else, if i 

TALK about it, great, if not, mind your own damn business 

[11:23] <darksydephil> nice shadowkingl94 , IMO it's a great game so far 

[11:24] <darksydephil> not everything involved in my life is like a Danganronpa case lol 

[11:25] <darksydephil> ok we all ready for prestream? 

[11:26] <darksydephil> Junko is the worst character in the game lol 
[11:26] <darksydephil> horribly written, not plausible, bad voice acting 
[11:28] <darksydephil> idiot 
[16:53] <darksydephil> heres why 

[16:53] <darksydephil> im playing a game for my viewers 

[16:53] <darksydephil> not to fucking talk to some other guy who is obviously an attention whore and wants to 
invade my stream and take away from what im doing 

[16:54] <darksydephil> nobody here cares about this, if he wanted to talk to me, he could have emailed etc. 
[16:54] <darksydephil> instead he wants attention 

[16:54] <darksydephil> so he can have attention on his own streams, this isn’t finance talk lol 
[16:54] <darksydephil> im not pissed? 

[16:54] <darksydephil> that's great darkandfullofterrors 



[16:55] <darksydephil> he can talk about it on his streams then lol 
[16:55] <darksydephil> i like to play games on my sterams 
[16:55] <darksydephil> streams that is 

[16:56] <darksydephil> thats great, i have advice on how to play super street fighter II turbo, but i dont invade 
other peoples streams and have my viewers spam their chat with nonsense unrelated to what they're doing to 
offer that advice 

[16:57] <darksydephil> my email has always been darksydephil@hotmail.com 

[16:57] <darksydephil> um, it filled the stream with spammers and nobody who was here before the raid could 
talk, it's quite rude 

[16:59] <darksydephil> basically, from my perspective here’s what I know about Destiny: 1. he tweeted me and 
caused my twitter to get spammed, so i blocked him. 2. he conducted a stream raid that spammed my stream 
chat, that's it. the guy should probably learn how to properly communicate like an adult without having me get 
spam bombed, then maybe i’ll actually care if he wants to talk or not 

[17:00] <darksydephil> ZaitaNZ he disrupted my business, TWICE, in some kind of an attempt to get attention, 
that's not what an adult does, that's not being closed minded, that's not being an idiot. 

[17:01] <darksydephil> we don't need more mods, we need less people doing nonsense like this today lol 
[17:01] <darksydephil> he wanted me to skype him? that wouldn’t have happened regardless lol 
[17:02] <darksydephil> um, viewers dont’ amount to money on twitch, that's twitch 101 really, i dont care about 
getting lk extra viewers who want to talk about car financing when im trying to focus on playing a game, thats 
just an annoying distraction 

[17:15] <darksydephil> Timeout Verified Destiny : mang I ain't gonna run through the hoops and e-mail 
someone f that, I just wanted to chat for like 5 minutes on stream and shit 
[17:15] <darksydephil> LOL 

[17:15] <darksydephil> i'm not gonna bother emailing! That takes effort! instead i'll raid your stream and spam 
your twitter lol 

[17:16] <darksydephil> okay, so let's just clear the air then 
[17:16] <darksydephil> 1. i don’t want to talk about a car 
[17:16] <darksydephil> 2. i don’t want to talk with you on my streams 
[17:16] <darksydephil> okay? 

[17:17] <darksydephil> my streams are for gameplay with my viewers, thats it. maybe some random chat with 
them, not talking car financing with other streamers, honestly having this conversation is absurd 
[17:17] <darksydephil> that's fabulous 

[17:17] <darksydephil> go talk to your viewers about those reasons 

[17:18] <darksydephil> mororoccan mint i believe from Stash 

[17:19] <darksydephil> lol well if you dont like mint, you wont like the tea 

[17:19] <darksydephil> they have other kinds like spearmint etc but the moroccan kind is my favorite 
[17:20] <darksydephil> this just in folks! on Tuesday instead of playing a game, i'm going to talk about how 
another random streamer could do his beard grooming better, and then we’ll all jump to his chat and demand to 
talk about it! lol. but seriously, how people act like this on the regular is just baffling to me. probably because i'm 
35 and way past acting like that 

[17:21] <darksydephil> i just focus on my own shit and having fun with games 

[17:22] <darksydephil> the best part is saying "but it would benefit you because you have less viewers!" sure, 
it'll benefit me and i wont get to play the game im here to play, and get distracted to talk about something i dont 
even care about, sounds like a great benefit lol 

[17:22] <darksydephil> i dont find car purchases a "fun discussion" at all really 
[00:41] <darksydephil> troll tears are indeed tasty 

[00:41] <darksydephil> loving the flavor of all the ones tonight, since these morons for the last day all circle 
jerked each other about KOGaming being partnered with a network called Laveria when in reality, it never was 
lol

[19:31] <darksydephil> okay, just cleaned house 




[19:32] <darksydephil> fine, just got home, putting today's uploads in playlist etc 
[19:35] <darksydephil> yup thats alwyas kind of been my thing 

[19:35] <darksydephil> you usually dont have to wait a long time to see me beat a game, with a few exceptions 
for longer games 

[19:40] <darksydephil> its just improv/reactionary stuff most of the time, easy for me to do on the fly for 
whatever reason 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170509-01 PREY 5TH.LOG 

[11:10] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:11] <darksydephil> im good, just a bit behind 

[11:12] <darksydephil> sooo 

[11:12] <darksydephil> youtube adsense. yeah lol. things are looking horrible 

[11:13] <darksydephil> as in, it looks like adsense makes about half what the ad revenue of a partnered network 
makes 

[11:13] <darksydephil> im gonna give it one more day 
[11:13] <darksydephil> but its hilarious that this data isn’t public 

[11:14] <darksydephil> its hilarious that everyone is saying MCNs are worthless, yet i've not directly tried going 
solo and the outcome looks like disaster lol 
[11:14] <darksydephil> i've NOW, not not 

[11:15] <darksydephil> im not even kidding, it looks like even days when im getting huge spiked views for new 
releases (Prey) the ad revenue on a normal adsense is awful 

[11:16] <darksydephil> i just don't get how people were so misinformed about MCNs, lol 

[11:18] <darksydephil> i was going to get repartnered, but both MCNs i was working with ended up being full of 
shit so i tried the solo thing for a few days 

[11:19] <darksydephil> i could go back with Curse right now. like, instantly, it'd probably take them a day or 

less to put me back into their network, but its baffling me that ad revenue is SO LOW on a normal adsense lol 

[11:19] <darksydephil> dspfandood , i PMed all patrons, thats a pretty big way to mention it lol 

[11:20] <darksydephil> have all of you who've been watching my YT videos been seeing the ads? ive checked 

random videos from like, all time periods and they all had them, so thats why im baffled the earnings are so bad 

[11:23] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:23] <darksydephil> stream will be live shortly 

[11:32] <darksydephil> yeah, moronic drama gets viewers from morons 

[11:32] <darksydephil> you should expect that, there are tons of stupid people 

[11:36] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:36] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:39] <darksydephil> ok brb 

[11:39] <darksydephil> gonnna grab drinks and then we’lls tart 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170509-02 PERSONA 5 17TH.LOG 

[18:41] <darksydephil> sigh 

[18:41] <darksydephil> this is ridiculous 

[18:42] <darksydephil> im screwed again, and its all youtubes fault, again. 

[18:42] <darksydephil> well i went back with Curse, because that partnership was going well 

[18:42] <darksydephil> but youtube auto-unmonetized all of my videos and due to a bug, i can't bulk-monetize 

them, they expect me to MANUALLY enable ads on 43k videos one at a time 

[18:42] <darksydephil> and youtube help is looking into it but says it could take days to figure out 

[18:44] <darksydephil> yeah the bug is so fucking stupid, it just says "edit in process" and has for a week since i 

bulk monetized the videos last week 

[18:44] <darksydephil> all the videos have ads, but the "process" never completed, so i can’t do another one 
[18:45] <darksydephil> WHY youtube bulk unmonetized all of my videos when i repartnered with curse makes 
zero sense, it should have kept the fuckig settings 

[18:46] <darksydephil> theres no way im putting ads on 43k videos, it takes almost a minute PER video 





[18:51] <darksydephil> wow 

[18:52] <darksydephil> so check this out 

[18:52] <darksydephil> ads are still showing on all of my videos, even though it says they’re unmonetized from 
my channel video manager 

[18:52] <darksydephil> that means youtube is keeping all that ad revenue lol 

[19:06] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:06] <darksydephil> ill be streaming shortly 

[19:06] <darksydephil> sigh 

[19:06] <darksydephil> ill talk about this fiasco on prestream 
[19:18] <darksydephil> okay tweeting now, then we can talk 
[21:48] <darksydephil> crap

[21:49] <darksydephil> I dunno i fhtis was a random internet fluctuation or not 
[21:50] <darksydephil> because it was ONLY the upstairs modem that went out

[21:50] <darksydephil> almost never happens 

[21:50] <darksydephil> if its DDOS i have no ida how my IP got out 

[21:50] <darksydephil> no idea that is

[18:55] <darksydephil> oh 

[18:55] <darksydephil> nevermind then 

[18:57] <darksydephil> if i still can’t get the laptop at this point, i find it hilarious that people were screaming in

[19:01] <darksydephil> ok everyone ready? 

[19:01] <darksydephil> all 2 of you lol

[19:10] <darksydephil> shout out to party bones ! 

[19:10] <darksydephil> Derich you always get shoutouts lol 

[19:53] <darksydephil> oops i misclicked lol 

[19:53] <darksydephil> that was my fault lol 

[21:09] <darksydephil> uh oh 

[21:09] <darksydephil> internet dropped out again 

[21:09] <darksydephil> not good, i think this is a DDOS 

[21:09] <darksydephil> because its 2 nights ina row now 

[21:09] <darksydephil> unless its total coincidence 

[21:09] <darksydephil> i have no idea whatsoever how they got my IP this time to 
[21:09] <darksydephil> this sucks 

[21:09] <darksydephil> we’ll have to see if it keeps happening or not 

[21:09] <darksydephil> if it does i know how to fix it, its just a major pain in the ass 

[21:10] <darksydephil> the thing is i didnt see it in my router logs last night when i checked 

[21:10] <darksydephil> all i saw was that my IP had somehow changed 

[21:10] <darksydephil> yeah Whiit3ShaDow it is really weird, i mean look at attendance 

[21:10] <darksydephil> its low as hell, low key stream, so why DDOS me now? very odd 

[21:10] <darksydephil> and its not like last night where ther was a a crazy cheer war or anything 

[21:11] <darksydephil> so its not like its a huge effect, i dunno, weird 

[21:12] <darksydephil> well just hold up folks, internet should be back ina few 




[21:12] <darksydephil> it took about 5 minutes last night 
[21:12] <darksydephil> actually wait.... 

[21:12] <darksydephil> um 

[21:12] <darksydephil> my internet is still working 
[21:12] <darksydephil> thi sis odd lol 

[21:13] <darksydephil> im gonna try to restart, this is werid be i still have internet but hte stream died somehow 
[21:13] <darksydephil> i dont think it was a ddos at all 
[21:13] <darksydephil> hold up 

[21:13] <darksydephil> WTF ok stream is going live again righ tnow 
[21:13] <darksydephil> i have no explanation for this one lol 

[21:13] <darksydephil> the stream just died and wouldn’t continue but i didnt lose interenet, bizzare 

[21:32] <darksydephil> ok this time the modem went off 

[21:32] <darksydephil> so it could be DDOS 

[21:32] <darksydephil> yeah the modem is reseetting again 

[21:32] <darksydephil> this makes no sense though, this stream has less views lol 

[21:33] <darksydephil> i will check the modem logs and see if it says packets got sent my way, last night it 

didn't say there were, just htat the IP somehow changed 

[21:33] <darksydephil> again, i have no idea how they got my IP this time 

[21:33] <darksydephil> last time it was through IRC chat 

[21:33] <darksydephil> yeah theoretically it could just be my internet, odd 

[21:34] <darksydephil> now obs froze lolol 

[21:35] <darksydephil> im going to start the stream just to say toodnight properly 

[21:35] <darksydephil> goodnight

[11:39] <darksydephil> the house smells great

[11:49] <darksydephil> stream is workgin on my side 

[11:49] <darksydephil> i can see it on both the desktop an dthe laptop 

[11:49] <darksydephil> yup pics are scrolling and theres audio 

[11:50] <darksydephil> is this a known twitch issue for some? 

[11:51] <darksydephil> its working on my dashboard and on my laptop 
[11:51] <darksydephil> try swapping stream qualities etc 

[11:52] <darksydephil> perhaps twitch is having issues with those streaming at higher bitrates today, i always 
stream at the max 

[11:53] <darksydephil> yeah maybe the cookies need to be cleared, who knows 

[11:53] <darksydephil> its definitely something outside of stuff here as the stream is working ifine on my end and 
i can see it on my laptop as well

[18:48] <darksydephil> hello 
[18:53] <darksydephil> ok 





[18:53] <darksydephil> setting up in a moment 

[18:53] <darksydephil> will we have another mysterious modem reset tonight? we didn’t have one earlier today 
during Prey which makes the whole thing so odd to begin with 

[18:54] <darksydephil> you'd think if it were DDOS they'd want to shut down the stream with more people and 

tips and cheers going etc 

[18:54] <darksydephil> the weirdest thing was 

[18:54] <darksydephil> after i went offline last night, it happened 2 more times 

[18:54] <darksydephil> like, as i was setting up uploads and afterward, it didn’t have any effect whatsoever, 
because uploads just auto resume where they left off. so why would someone have attacked THEN when the 
stream was over? 

[18:54] <darksydephil> it's just bizarre, and i still have no idea how they'd get my IP 

[18:55] <darksydephil> yeah but then it should affect both of my internet lines, not just one. thats the really 

myserious thing that makes me suspect DDOS 

[18:57] <darksydephil> nope, because once its down, its down and just has to restart, it's a matter of how long it 

takes my modem to restart, not how long the attack lasts 

[18:57] <darksydephil> ddos attacks are typically short and in bursts 

[19:00] <darksydephil> this modem is brand new. as in, only a month old lol 

[19:00] <darksydephil> no, the purpose of DDOS is to flood the modem with so much data in such a short time it 
forces a restart 

[19:00] <darksydephil> hence the denial of service 

[19:01] <darksydephil> this modem has tons of firewall settings, but without an expert analyzing the data 
coming in at me, there's no way to know how to set it up properly, and im no expert 

[19:02] <darksydephil> let's see what happens tonight, as we now now, its not a huge deal, it only wastes a few 
minutes 

[19:02] <darksydephil> completely wrong lol 
[19:02] <darksydephil> um, yes 

[19:02] <darksydephil> ive been ddos attacked before and it acted exactly in this manner, we had logs to prove it 
[19:02] <darksydephil> you may be describing one manner of ddos attack but not all of them 
[19:03] <darksydephil> you're arguing semantics that don't matter, its the same end effect 
[19:03] <darksydephil> probably resident evil 1 is my fave. the original and i playe dit at launch 
[19:03] <darksydephil> it was pretty damn sweet 

[19:04] <darksydephil> which makes no sense soulrider, because i streamed 4 hours already today with no 
issues, how does it just happen to be between 9-10pm my local time every night tha ti have this issue? 

[19:05] <darksydephil> modems don't have off times lol 
[19:05] <darksydephil> the local box was checked 1 month ago 

[19:05] <darksydephil> so thats why its suspect that its anything here on my end. guy was just out, cleaned 
everythign up and gave me a new modem 

[19:06] <darksydephil> YaCherdy its hard to tell, because for some reason this modem didn’t log anything 
specific, last time i was ddos attacked there was a large record of it 

[19:06] <darksydephil> my ISP is legally required to tell me when they're doing routine maintenance because im 
on the business plan, its pretty sweet 

[19:08] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? can you see it? or are some still having problems? 

[19:09] <darksydephil> im not streaming over theri limits sanguinenite and besides, they have no power to make 

my modem cycle haha 

[19:09] <darksydephil> ok great 

[19:09] <darksydephil> probably just a technical blip on twitch's side earlier today then 
[19:12] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:12] <darksydephil> going to tweet that w're live, then start talking 
[19:14] <darksydephil> the sauce was crazy good 

[19:14] <darksydephil> put a pic of how much we made on instagram actually 
[19:14] <darksydephil> no, just the grinders were more than enough lol 
[19:14] <darksydephil> i got indigestion from it 



[19:15] <darksydephil> its 6 meals for 2 

[19:15] <darksydephil> and we spread it out so it lasts around 2-3 months usually 

[19:15] <darksydephil> its one of the best things to make because it lasts a long time and can make tons of great 
meals, very happy my mom taught me how to make it 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170512-01 PREY 8TH FINALE.LOG 

[11:02] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:05] <darksydephil> i'm kind of sad that Prey concludes today 
[11:05] <darksydephil> i really like the game lol 

[11:06] <darksydephil> well the truth is, we all know that Prey really sucks as IGN only gave it a 4 
[11:07] <darksydephil> we have no say in the matter BeTheAllen 
[11:07] <darksydephil> IGN says it sucks, so it sucks even if its enjoyable 
[11:10] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up now 

[11:11] <darksydephil> so FYI, now that im back with Curse, first days earnings came in and they're back up to 
wha tthey used to be 

[11:11] <darksydephil> so its confirmed, individual adsense is utter shit 

[11:12] <darksydephil> anyone who says being with an MCN isn’t worth it is an idiot, the earnings are almost 
double 

[11:12] <darksydephil> probably notjwalker70 since vlogging really isn’t a priority lately 

[11:12] <darksydephil> even when it was partnered it didn’t make anything significant 

[11:13] <darksydephil> DiamondsAre5ever : and i'm telling you, now from personal experience, that they're 

losing about 50% of what they can earn by not being in an MCN 

[11:13] <darksydephil> btw, OBS just crahsed lol 

[11:14] <darksydephil> that was a completely random crash 

[11:14] <darksydephil> hopefully it doesn't happen again 

[11:15] <darksydephil> i have no idea what you're talking about papalouthefirst 

[11:16] <darksydephil> oh isn tthat the guy that challenged people to f with him, then they got him taken off a 
plane and interrogated for hours? 

[11:17] <darksydephil> yeah, thats probably a stupid idea 
[11:17] <darksydephil> ok is the stream working? 

[11:18] <darksydephil> street fighter??? lol 

[11:19] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet htat we’r elive 

[11:20] <darksydephil> ok i tweeted that we’r elive 

[11:20] <darksydephil> let me get the laptop working now 

[11:21] <darksydephil> ok got hte laptop working 

[11:22] <darksydephil> if i went solely to twitch id have to stream an unhealthy amount of hours unless i 
doubled my viewership/participation 

[11:22] <darksydephil> so thats probably not gonna happen 
[11:22] <darksydephil> thats why im here 

[11:23] <darksydephil> sadly youtube is pretty much over at this point, they buried their own business 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170512-02 PERSONA 5 20TH.LOG

[19:35] <darksydephil> yes but i believe you need everything to be stat 4 to pass that last challenge? 

[19:36] <darksydephil> id probably try the reaper at the end of the game 

[19:36] <darksydephil> yes ive got the crossroads job and it led me to the mementos mission i needed

[11:01] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:02] <darksydephil> so i got an email from youtube that a video in mass effect andromeda was blocked for 
copyright reasons by some random company that holds no copyright ownership over the game 
[11:03] <darksydephil> i tried to get more details and it says theres no copyright claim, sooo yeah, youtubes 
system is bullshit 

[11:05] <darksydephil> btw i dont feel well today, stomach feels like shit 
[11:07] <darksydephil> oh? someone buying it? 

[11:08] <darksydephil> ugh i dont feel well 

[11:09] <darksydephil> debating streaming right now since i feel so queasy 
[11:09] <darksydephil> nothing, i woke up feeling sick to my stomach 
[11:10] <darksydephil> right now i seriously feel like im gonna barf lol 

[11:11] <darksydephil> i think i may have to cancel the stream, take some meds or something and try to go back 
to sleep for a while until i feel better, right now its not looking so good 
[11:12] <darksydephil> yeah i think i might have to 
[11:13] <darksydephil> im trying to think

[19:32] <darksydephil> by the way Zahvone 
[19:32] <darksydephil> you're going to Chicago? 

[19:32] <darksydephil> try the deep dish pizza, theres a chain of restaurants in th earea known for it 
[19:33] <darksydephil> not off the top o fimy head but it was easy to figure out 






[19:33] <darksydephil> just look online or on yelp etc 

[19:33] <darksydephil> also, if you're into breakfast, try WildBerry Cafe 

[19:34] <darksydephil> they're VERY popular and theres a wait but it was incredibly good, so good we went 
twice when we were in Chicago on vacation 
[19:34] <darksydephil> the stream isn’t archived 

[19:34] <darksydephil> i just deleted it. going ot upload immediately after the show ends 
[19:35] <darksydephil> this is the conclusion of hate live, it never finished 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170515 DAY OFF.LOG

[11:13] <darksydephil> batphil isn't approved yet, darn 

[11:14] <darksydephil> i didnt say i wouldn’t take Leanna to a hospital, that never happened and you sound 
really stupid right now

[11:17] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet that we're live 
[11:21] <darksydephil> ok trying to get the laptop set up here 

[11:22] <darksydephil> darkseid should be OP, he's a preorder only boss character that won’t be allowed in 
competitive play, and he's pretty much the strongest character in DC besides a few exceptions 
[11:24] <darksydephil> ok finally got the laptop workin 
[11:24] <darksydephil> ill start prestream in a sec 

[11:25] <darksydephil> LOL Batman killed Darkseid? well that's embarassing, a normal human 
[11:26] <darksydephil> no Lex in this game is a huge mistake IMO 

[11:26] <darksydephil> yeah Lex died in injustice 1 to save the world, he was a hero remember? 

[15:30] <darksydephil> fyi i know about obs, its fine 
[15:30] <darksydephil> its working now 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170516-02 INJUSTICE 2 2ND.LOG

[19:32] <darksydephil> gonna be a fun week if people keep showing up in droves like that 

[19:33] <darksydephil> well what im going to do tonight is re-play those chapters where i had a choice of 

character, playing the other character i didnt use yet 

[19:33] <darksydephil> and that should unlock the second ending 

[19:33] <darksydephil> and that apparently unlocks a bunch of in game stuff too 

[19:33] <darksydephil> then tomorrow we can check out the other stuff 

[19:35] <darksydephil> im going to link the app right now actually since we have to wait anyway 
[19:36] <darksydephil> it worked 

[19:36] <darksydephil> i got a diamond box and the Grid skin for cyborg 

[19:37] <darksydephil> out of who i played with today, i liked Catwoman, Supergirl, Superman, Batman and 
Aquaman. Green Arrow a bit but i didnt figure out his arrows very well 
[19:37] <darksydephil> oh and Green Lantern of course 

[19:38] <darksydephil> i didnt play as any villains yet so i dunno, i want to gry Grodd and swamp thing badly 

[19:38] <darksydephil> online play now works btw 

[19:39] <darksydephil> i dont know since you cant play as her in the story 

[19:40] <darksydephil> great, happy that you enjoyed it 

[19:41] <darksydephil> waiting for the final video to finish uploading 






[19:41] <darksydephil> its close to done 

[19:42] <darksydephil> im equipping the alternate colors right now that i earned 
[19:43] <darksydephil> wow both Yolo lantern and John Stewart are skins for lantern 
[19:44] <darksydephil> yeah some of these outfits are quite good 
[19:46] <darksydephil> LOL they've got the original flash 
[19:46] <darksydephil> i just got standard edition 
[19:47] <darksydephil> lol mr freeze skin 

[19:47] <darksydephil> why the fuck didnt they just put mr freeze in the game by default 
[19:47] <darksydephil> he's way cooler than captain cold lol. fuck suicide squad 
[19:48] <darksydephil> you unlock skins with credits 

[19:48] <darksydephil> which you get by playing and earning/opening chests i believe 
[19:49] <darksydephil> pretty interesting 
[19:49] <darksydephil> some supers are pretty lame though 
[19:55] <darksydephil> ok stream starting up again! 

[20:00] <darksydephil> test 

[20:00] <darksydephil> somehow im talking logged into stream chat here while in my video window it says im 
logged out lol 

[20:01] <darksydephil> both yellow and red lantern are in the game, well those versions of Hal Jordan that is 
[20:02] <darksydephil> who were the top characters in tournament play of injustice 1? 

[20:02] <darksydephil> i thought superman was OP? 

[20:04] <darksydephil> at least in injustice 2, there was no fucking with alternate dimensions like last time 
[21:19] <darksydephil> batphil approved! oh shit 
[21:19] <darksydephil> everyone can use batphil now 

[21:53] <darksydephil> it was pretty awesome that Batphil emote got approved during the stream lol 
[21:53] <darksydephil> ok good night folks! see you tomorrow for another awesome day of injustice 2 streaming! 
[21:54] <darksydephil> FYI im going to do the giveaway either tomorrow or thursday. i knew today would be 
too chaotic with the story

[11:04] <darksydephil> hello folks 

[11:05] <darksydephil> should be live shortly 

[11:05] <darksydephil> i have no idea what multiverse mode is so this should be interesting 
[11:07] <darksydephil> nice 

[11:07] <darksydephil> Deadpylons : yes it does, i just clicked it 
[11:07] <darksydephil> and it brought me to the page 

[11:08] <darksydephil> danielsvensonl : ive talked about this tons of times already this week, watch the 
prestreams for that info 

[11:11] <darksydephil> danielsvenson 1 : if you stick around, a prestream will be happening live in just a few 

minutes, and ill explain again 

[11:11] <darksydephil> man ive changed lol 

[11:12] <darksydephil> in the old days i would have been a complete asshole and insulted you for asking 
something thats public knowledge, but im really mellowing out now lol 
[11:12] <darksydephil> i guess thats a good thing 

[11:12] <darksydephil> i used to be a pretty nasty person, i acknowledge that 
[11:13] <darksydephil> its going good, still waking up a bit lol 
[11:13] <darksydephil> didnt drink my v8 yet

[16:00] <darksydephil> no need to pay attention to them 
[16:01] <darksydephil> later! hope to see some of you tonight 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170517-02 INJUSTICE 2 4TH.LOG 

[18:53] <darksydephil> stream will be starting shortly! 

[19:03] <darksydephil> ok getting the laptop working again 
[19:03] <darksydephil> then ill chat with ya 

[19:03] <darksydephil> i havent watched the ufc in over 10 years lol 

[19:04] <darksydephil> good evening all 

[19:04] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[19:05] <darksydephil> morning already, geez 
[19:05] <darksydephil> ok then ill tweet that we’re live 
[19:07] <darksydephil> the future peripheral you'll trade in for $10? yup 
[20:02] <darksydephil> enough of that idiot 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170518-01 INJUSTICE 2 5TH.LOG 

[11:01] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:02] <darksydephil> late? 

[11:02] <darksydephil> im here and setting up as usual 
[11:02] <darksydephil> no, it does not 
[11:02] <darksydephil> it says 1 lam pdt 

[11:03] <darksydephil> you're reading an outdated schedule from 2 days ago that was wrong and i didnt set up 

[11:03] <darksydephil> my twitter is the schedule, always has been 

[11:03] <darksydephil> let me check to see if online works 

[11:05] <darksydephil> online play might not be working 

[11:05] <darksydephil> so...lol 

[11:07] <darksydephil> yeah it wont connect to the server 
[11:07] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:07] <darksydephil> it didnt work yesterday either FYI, but i wasnt planning on doing it yesterday anyway 
[11:08] <darksydephil> yeah im gonna restart the entire console and see what happens 
[11:08] <darksydephil> what on earth is CDT 
[11:08] <darksydephil> central time? 

[11:09] <darksydephil> literally nobody goes by CDT except those who live there lol 
[11:10] <darksydephil> so maybe i should start the stream, do prestream, and then see if it works lol 
[11:10] <darksydephil> its pretty assinine that they're doing maintenance in the middle of the daytime of a day 
when their prime audience would be playing 

[11:10] <darksydephil> most maintenance is done overnight for that very reason, to avoid issues 

[11:13] <darksydephil> the prime customer base of Injustice 2 is the USA. it just is. so doing maintenance now is 

stupid 

[11:13] <darksydephil> anyway, ill set up the stream 
[11:20] <darksydephil> ive got it playing demo mode 
[11:21] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:24] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 
[11:24] <darksydephil> and hope you feel better Gino 
[11:25] <darksydephil> why are you spamming kozatof ? 

[11:25] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:25] <darksydephil> stop using the schedule command, i dont update it, thats why i have twitter 

[11:26] <darksydephil> seriously, people coming in here using it and getting outdated info is pretty annoying 





[11:26] <darksydephil> nice thanks somonel92 ! 

[11:28] <darksydephil> my focus is on twitch, why would i do a shitty meaningless reaction video like other 
garbage youtubers? lol 

[11:29] <darksydephil> i never enabled the schedule command myself, it was always done by mods who are 
busy right now. instead of being difficult, perhaps you could just listen to me, the person running the darn stream, 
when I tell you where to go for the schedule, not rocket science lol 
[11:30] <darksydephil> wow, i didnt even ban that guy 

[11:30] <darksydephil> the chat was so delayed it banned the guy above where i clicked 
[11:30] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:30] <darksydephil> im not cranky at all actually, just people being stupid so i have to deal with it 
[11:31] <darksydephil> i said you're being difficult, which is exactly the case actually

<darksydephil> got a phone call last minute that lasted a bit 
<darksydephil> um, no 
<darksydephil> im not braindead stupid lol 

<darksydephil> no, it wouldn’t, it would just piss me off and entertain more trolls who DON’T cheer or 
<darksydephil> and they can go fuck themselves 

<darksydephil> no, they do not, they do not enjoy hearing people insult me while we're playing 
<darksydephil> now i suggest you give up on this now 
<darksydephil> yeah i think im going to try those zah rastafari 
<darksydephil> probably sometime this week if/when i eat out 
<darksydephil> they both look and sound shitty lol 
<darksydephil> okay 
<darksydephil> stream working?

<darksydephil> sigh 

<darksydephil> i dunno how people stand this chat lol

[10:59] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:00] <darksydephil> my schedule is always fluctuating, it was never a set thing 
[11:02] <darksydephil> ok stream is about to go live 
[11:09] <darksydephil> hows the stream looking? 

[11:10] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:11] <darksydephil> Popsicolo were you always? 

[11:11] <darksydephil> yeah Derichloveslemur a typical weird, inexplicable heel turn from wwe 
[11:11] <darksydephil> ah gotcha Popsicolo that's what i thought 
[11:14] <darksydephil> ok heading over to the laptop to get set up 

[11:16] <darksydephil> the ragequit thing was in february of 2016...pretty outdated unless he's doing it again, in 
which case i really don't give a shit, you can't be more uninformed and insecure than to insult someone 
incorrectly, then when you get called out on it, threaten to fight them IRL lol 
[11:16] <darksydephil> soulrider95 i have no idea what you're talking about 
[11:17] <darksydephil> LOL ampac well, you can't help stupid i guess

[12:10] <darksydephil> hello all 

[12:10] <darksydephil> just getting into the office after being on the phone for over an hour 
[12:10] <darksydephil> thanks justonepufff! 

[12:11] <darksydephil> im pretty exhausted but happy to know all of this current stress will be over soon with 
the car stuff 

[12:12] <darksydephil> its all stressful lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> and im scheduling maintenance on the old car, turning in the old car, and then the arrival

of the new car, plus figuring out the insurance etc 

[12:13] <darksydephil> its been pretty hectic 

[12:14] <darksydephil> an inspection is not maintenance lol 

[12:14] <darksydephil> theres all kinds of factors here, like the east coast bmw dealership completely ignoring 
me/blowing me off after delivering the car in 2014 and never contacting me to do the maintenance on the car etc 
[12:15] <darksydephil> they also only ever gave me one set of keys, and the car didn’t even have all the features 
they’d promised me. it was a big fiasco 

[12:15] <darksydephil> there were no intervals, the car was barely driven so it never actually needed to be 
changed, so i was lucky 

[12:16] <darksydephil> yes, but it didnt. thats my point, i was lucky 

[12:16] <darksydephil> no, i have to have the oil changed and brake fluid swapped when turning in the car. if i 
hadn’t they wer egoing to charge me $750! lol 

[12:17] <darksydephil> as it is, im getting the new car soon so the BMW wont' ever be driven again until i turn it 
in 

[12:19] <darksydephil> even when i lived alone, i made it a habit to go out at least a few times a week, you just 

need it. being indoors constantly makes you stir crazy 

[12:19] <darksydephil> okay 

[12:19] <darksydephil> stream starting shortly 

[12:20] <darksydephil> yeah i started updating it myself 

[12:21] <darksydephil> oh my god 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i have so much sand in my eyes lol 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i immediately started making calls when i woke up and didnt notice 
[12:24] <darksydephil> theres no such thing as a cross platform console game 

[12:24] <darksydephil> the closest its come is pc to a console but never across consoles, they operate on 
completely different multiplayer networks 

[12:25] <darksydephil> neither, i dont have it and will never install it again 

[12:25] <darksydephil> i got it digitally so i could play it at midnight release, then it didnt work for 2 days after 
launch anyway 

[12:26] <darksydephil> backlash kind of sucked, i wasn’t really impressed by any matches, so watered down 
compared to what they allow them to do in NXT 
[12:29] <darksydephil> okay stream working wll? 

[12:29] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet out then 
[15:23] <darksydephil> idiot lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170522-02 INJUSTICE 2 9TH.LOG 

[19:00] <darksydephil> hello 
[19:01] <darksydephil> anyone here? 

[19:02] <darksydephil> darn 
[19:07] <darksydephil> ok 

[19:07] <darksydephil> stream going live again now 

[19:08] <darksydephil> so apparently the song used in the latest KOGaming fan submission has Justin Bieber in 
it, in the full version, plus other singers/artists. This is the instrumental version, and a ton of retards are actually 
leaving comments saying "thumbs down be this song is Justin Bieber" when it isn’t. I mean, damn. That's the 
definition of stupidity. 

[19:09] <darksydephil> the stream should be live, i just turned it on 

[19:11] <darksydephil> dinner was fine 

[19:11] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live and then start talking 
[19:14] <darksydephil> not the mic 
[19:14] <darksydephil> no worries 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i was playing the prestream from earlier lol

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170525-01 INJUSTICE 2 12TH.LOG 

[11:05] <darksydephil> hello 
[11:05] <darksydephil> car is here 

[11:05] <darksydephil> so setting up now. ill check it out later lol 
[11:05] <darksydephil> i got a hummer, with all the trimmings Kappa 
[11:07] <darksydephil> oh boy hoi don 

[11:07] <darksydephil> guy thinks he left his phone in my car LOL 
[11:07] <darksydephil> giv erne a sec guys, im gonna see if its in there 
[11:15] <darksydephil> ok back 
[11:15] <darksydephil> these guy haha 

[11:15] <darksydephil> he's a young asian guy and he’s pretty much hyper, he thought he’d dropped his phone in 

my car when he delivered it, but then found it in another car 

[11:15] <darksydephil> so NOW i’m good to go to set up the stream sheesh 

[11:15] <darksydephil> i told you man 

[11:16] <darksydephil> it's a classic Delorian, with the doors that flip up and everything 
[11:16] <darksydephil> i'm going back in time to when youtube was a nice place! 

[11:17] <darksydephil> more like my Credit qualified for it, and your bits will be paying for the car moving 
forward haha 

[11:17] <darksydephil> deadpylons are you the guy that used OP gear against my wishes, hit me twice for tons 
of damage so i gave up,a dn then tweeted me? 

[11:18] <darksydephil> oh okay 

[11:18] <darksydephil> just wanted to be sure 

[11:18] <darksydephil> idiot 

[11:19] <darksydephil> if i get a ton of people like that today im just gonna go ranked but we’ll see 
[11:19] <darksydephil> the gear system is one of my gripes with the game in my review, as expected, it ruins 
entire modes of MP 

[11:19] <darksydephil> should be OFF by fucking default, not on 
[11:19] <darksydephil> okay, now im going to set up the stream 

[11:21] <darksydephil> BTW you guys may notice "chatters" in here saying completely unrelated stuff, its view 
bots and ill talk about it on prestream 

[11:22] <darksydephil> a viewbot is just that: a bot that impersonates a stream viewer 
[11:22] <darksydephil> even talks to pretend like its a stream viewer 

[11:23] <darksydephil> no worries xthewrath93x im already on top of it, as ill explain in the prestream 

[11:23] <darksydephil> to be honest i was wondering why i was getting SO MANY new followers on here in the 

last week, i mean i know injustice 2 is popular but im not THAT popular haha 

[11:24] <darksydephil> something like 1500 new followers in a week is nuts 

[11:24] <darksydephil> yes it does 

[11:24] <darksydephil> and someone's an idiot to think we wouldn’t notice 
[11:25] <darksydephil> boooncetv: TETRiS iS BETTER 
[11:25] <darksydephil> theres one right there 

[11:25] <darksydephil> as i just said a bunch of times, im on top of it and ill talk about it on prestream 
[11:26] <darksydephil> so relax lol 




[11:26] <darksydephil> another one 

[11:27] <darksydephil> yeah, it has to be said: if you played the hell out of INjustice 2 for a week just to get OP 
gear and you'll only play with it on, you're fucking pathetic 
[11:28] <darksydephil> i agree JasonBiggs64 

[11:28] <darksydephil> I got a Ford Pinto. Can't wait for the first hot day! 

[11:29] <darksydephil> um if any of you actually think id get another bmw you're insane 

[11:29] <darksydephil> i needed to LOWER MY PAYMENTS and help my budget, that was the whole point 

[11:30] <darksydephil> anyway 

[11:30] <darksydephil> is the stream working? 

[11:30] <darksydephil> another hot 

[11:31] <darksydephil> Chachamaru89 : banana yellow of course 
[11:31] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 

[11:31] <darksydephil> LOL stoemp2 i believe ya, the bots are outta control 

[11:33] <darksydephil> yup 

[16:14] <darksydephil> thats gotta be a bot lol 

[16:14] <darksydephil> thats definitely a bot 

[16:14] <darksydephil> we’ll see if twitch responds or not to my email last night 
[16:14] <darksydephil> but for the most part they said you can't be held accountable for it

[11:00] <darksydephil> bots? 

[11:01] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:01] <darksydephil> so as soon as i go to set up the entire thing crashes 
[11:01] <darksydephil> sigh 

[11:01] <darksydephil> damn i need to restart my laptop badly 
[11:01] <darksydephil> im gonna do that now 
[11:04] <darksydephil> soooo 

[11:05] <darksydephil> if the game doesn't work in 30 minutes ill play persona 5 
[11:05] <darksydephil> not much i can do about it 

[11:05] <darksydephil> dude, im tired of injustice, at least MP. ive played so fucking much of it 

[11:05] <darksydephil> only thing id consider at this point is some guild multiverse mode but thats not exactly 

exciting 

[11:06] <darksydephil> a scoundrel how many times do i have to explain that views on twitch are meaningless? 
lol 

[11:06] <darksydephil> they seriously are 

[11:07] <darksydephil> ride to hell could happen if people want it 

[11:07] <darksydephil> im surprised honestly it only got nominated by 1 person for the patrons choice event 

[11:07] <darksydephil> people seemed to enjoy it on stream 

[11:09] <darksydephil> stream isnt live yet be the game doesn't work lol 

[11:09] <darksydephil> not goign to set upt he stream until i know what im streaming 

[11:10] <darksydephil> also does this game run at 60fps or 30 on consoles? 

[11:11] <darksydephil> forza the 13 th 

[11:11] <darksydephil> the stream starts when the game works 
[11:12] <darksydephil> and everyone is waiting for the game to work 
[11:16] <darksydephil> well 

[11:17] <darksydephil> at least this is giving me a chance to restart and setup the laptop properly 
[11:17] <darksydephil> its been ages since i restarted it lol 
[11:17] <darksydephil> the servers are down akioartorius 

[11:17] <darksydephil> i.e. the game only has MP and nobody can play the MP. kind of a problem 
[11:18] <darksydephil> no, the laptop is put into sleep mode when im not using it 
[11:18] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna get drinks 
[11:23] <darksydephil> ok back 




[11:23] <darksydephil> sooo 

[11:24] <darksydephil> nope they're not lol 

[11:24] <darksydephil> i just checked 

[11:24] <darksydephil> the twitter doesn't mean anything, the actual game does 
[11:25] <darksydephil> and the actual game still doesn't connect to server 
[11:25] <darksydephil> they can say whatever they want on twitter lol 

[11:25] <darksydephil> i cant do prestream be this game runs at 60ps, and if i ddo persona that'll be a totally 

different quality so id have to restart the stream, no reason to do so 

[11:26] <darksydephil> oh my god 

[11:26] <darksydephil> some people are slow lol 

[11:26] <darksydephil> ive done prestreams every day, i just didnt upload them 
[11:26] <darksydephil> because the vids up uploading are staggered 
[11:26] <darksydephil> due to making so many injustice 2 vids 
[11:26] <darksydephil> goodbye moron 

[11:27] <darksydephil> we all know, i just sit here ranting insults about my viewers constantly 
[11:27] <darksydephil> that's my schtick right? 

[11:27] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:28] <darksydephil> ok it looks like servers are coming back up 

[11:28] <darksydephil> although this is hilarious, the game thinks its may 18th lol 

[11:28] <darksydephil> that could be a problem 

[11:28] <darksydephil> at least if the in game date dies to anything 

[11:29] <darksydephil> wow the game has a setting to mute copyrighted music 

[11:29] <darksydephil> i wonder if i should, no idea if these vids will get claimed 

[11:30] <darksydephil> yeah i guess ill let it ride to start and see what happens 

[11:31] <darksydephil> ok game seems to be working 

[11:31] <darksydephil> so ill start the stream up 

[11:37] <darksydephil> god damn it 

[11:37] <darksydephil> now im being told its 30fps for console 
[11:37] <darksydephil> someone just fucking said 60 

[11:37] <darksydephil>. 

[11:37] <darksydephil> gotta restart 

[11:39] <darksydephil> technically there is no economically feasible pc that can stream, capture and play at 
1080p/60fps of new games, doesn't exist, it maxes the CPU. so you have to find ways around it like using 
shadowplay etc 

[11:40] <darksydephil> ok stream should now be live? 

[11:44] <darksydephil> ok stream working? 

[11:44] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[11:47] <darksydephil> thanks Daihikse 

[11:48] <darksydephil> well im connected 

[11:48] <darksydephil> so as long as i dont disconnect i should be fine i hope 
[11:48] <darksydephil> ok time for prestream i guess 

[13:10] <darksydephil> if i dont want to play overwatch, im not going to play overwatch, seriously, you guys 
need to stop, you'd rather see me play something i have no desire to play??? 

[13:10] <darksydephil> you don't dictate my life lol 
[13:10] <darksydephil> exactly MrPapaveraceae 
[13:11] <darksydephil> yes Glitch Crazed 

[14:38] <darksydephil> friday the 13th isnt working, its crashing constantly 
[14:38] <darksydephil> so ill try it out tonight 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170526-02 FRIDAY THE 13TH 1ST.LOG 

[17:56] <darksydephil> thats right, god the people in this chat! 

[17:56] <darksydephil> lol 





[18:15] <darksydephil> i didnt even know that 

[18:15] <darksydephil> i guess ill try randoms and then maybe some people from stream 
[18:15] <darksydephil> yeah, i dunno, it seems REALLY suspect that it'd be worth 40 bucks 
[18:18] <darksydephil> which community? the forums or the injustice guild? 

[18:18] <darksydephil> or another one i dont know about lol 

[18:18] <darksydephil> oh 

[18:18] <darksydephil> THAT community! 

[18:18] <darksydephil> see i knew there were ones i was forgetting lol 

[18:19] <darksydephil> yes im at the gym right now, holding a desktop pc and screen in front of me 
[18:19] <darksydephil> thats how i work out, i carry around a full desk with PC setup on top of it 
[18:19] <darksydephil> of course it is lol 

[18:20] <darksydephil> ok im off to relax for 30 mins or so, then i’ll be back for friday the 13th. by the way, a 
new dsp tries it should be going live any time now! 

[18:54] <darksydephil> people own the switch to try it? lol 

[18:55] <darksydephil> you seriously shouldn’t believe anything you hear like that lol 

[18:56] <darksydephil> the Wii was literally so popular, everyone who didn't play games wanted one. the Switch 
isn’t like that, at all. it's bullshit 

[18:56] <darksydephil> they can manipulate numbers to make anything sound like its crazy popular when in 
reality it isnt 

[18:57] <darksydephil> it doesn’t even make sense, outside of zelda theres nothing to play on switch, why would 
it be SO popular? IT’s not like Wii where there was tons of shovelware for casuals 

[18:59] <darksydephil> I REALLY want to know what these switch statistics are. like the Wii was incredibly 
popular but they also produced a shit ton of hte console so the stores were never out. Switch magically is just 
constantly out, like they can't make more, enough to stock the shelves? that's bullshit lol 

[18:59] <darksydephil> i get the feeling the numbers are based on how quickly they’re selling, there's no fucking 
way switch is selling MORE than the Wii did. that was one time phenomena 
[19:00] <darksydephil> okay ready to try this game again? lol 

[19:02] <darksydephil> well if this game doesn’t work again, it'll be a zero man team, because i'm going to hunt 
them down like Jason for my money back! 

[19:05] <darksydephil> oh 

[19:05] <darksydephil> so there you have it blue_blur64 

[19:05] <darksydephil> the numbers mean nothing, even the Wii U sold well at launch, and then tanked lol 
[19:06] <darksydephil> ok stream looking good? 

[19:06] <darksydephil> i liked it KushiYakitori despite the "twist" being incredibly cheesy, it was fun 

[19:06] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we're live then 

[19:09] <darksydephil> come on laptop, load the fucking stream 

[19:09] <darksydephil> oops its tha nk you for watching?! 

[19:09] <darksydephil> lol

[11:02] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:04] <darksydephil> are we still in a vicious battle against the bots? 

[11:04] <darksydephil> if you mean from the howard stern show, then yes 

[11:04] <darksydephil> although i haven't listened in a LONG time 

[11:05] <darksydephil> I did notice the daily new followers are slowing down now 

[11:05] <darksydephil> at one point it was over 100 a day, with most of them being bots 

[11:05] <darksydephil> np AuzzieSly47Adam 

[11:06] <darksydephil> ill let you know once it works consistently 

[11:06] <darksydephil> i guess we’ll see today 

[11:08] <darksydephil> ugh im all gunked up today 

[11:08] <darksydephil> for like a week i was good, had the window open in the bedroom and got fresh air. now 
its hot as fuck and i need the air conditioner on overnight and it messes with my head 
[11:09] <darksydephil> ok im going to turn on the stream 
[11:12] <darksydephil> yeah 

[11:13] <darksydephil> apparently the idea is, to get tons of bots in here one day so they'll get the twitch admins 
to monitor the channel 

[11:13] <darksydephil> then to cheer a bunch of insulting/racist stuff and try to get me to read it so ill get banned 
[11:13] <darksydephil> luckily im not a complete moron 
[11:13] <darksydephil> hey we all have slow moments 

[11:14] <darksydephil> and yeah, i did, and they responded thanks for telling them and they're working on 
solutions to the big picture issue of botting all the time 

[11:14] <darksydephil> if you know what you're doing, im sure its not that tough as jason 
[11:15] <darksydephil> the catch is, you rarely get to be him, so practice isn't very easy to get 
[11:15] <darksydephil> yeah i watched some Rick and Morty last night, honestly the first couple episodes 
sucked but from 3 on its really good 

[11:16] <darksydephil> i have no idea how far i got, i lost track and then fell asleep haha 
[11:16] <darksydephil> ok stream working? 

[11:16] <darksydephil> ok cool ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:18] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna grab drinks 
[11:23] <darksydephil> ok prestream in just a sec 

[11:25] <darksydephil> hold up, let me blow my nose FIRST, then start prestream lol 




[11:25] <darksydephil> probably the preferred order 
[13:33] <darksydephil> the code is SGMX 
[20:18] <darksydephil> so many bots 
[20:18] <darksydephil> so little time 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170529-01 PERSONA 5 23RD.LOG 

[11:07] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:07] <darksydephil> happy memorial day to those in the USA 

[11:08] <darksydephil> well i think today will be a far more laid back day here considering its persona 5 
[11:10] <darksydephil> today is Persona 5 as announced and discussed for the entire last day. Deal with it. 
[11:11] <darksydephil> Ill try friday the 13th again later this week when theres a much higher chance it'll work 
[11:11] <darksydephil> right after the devs posted up "we've fixed the issues!" a ton of people responded with 
screenshots that indeed they did not and people still can’t play 

[11:11] <darksydephil> this is not surprising, the game is a train wreck of the highest magnitude 

[11:13] <darksydephil> yeah still battling these bots 

[11:13] <darksydephil> they're slowing down though 

[11:13] <darksydephil> seeing far less of them now 

[11:15] <darksydephil> yeah i also banned like 40 bots last night 

[11:15] <darksydephil> just randomly opened the channel and saw tons of bot messages, boom, goodbye 
[11:16] <darksydephil> ok stream working? 

[11:16] <darksydephil> ok let me get audio working 
[11:17] <darksydephil> there we go 
[11:17] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[11:18] <darksydephil> okay just tweeted 

[11:19] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab drinks and then get started 

[11:22] <darksydephil> LOL 

[11:22] <darksydephil> who cares 

[11:22] <darksydephil> i file my taxes properly 

[11:22] <darksydephil> i have a tax attorney 

[11:23] <darksydephil> there's nothing they're going to do that can have any effect 

[11:23] <darksydephil> what are a bunch of idiot kids going to report regardless? not like they have some crazy 

insider info of wrongdoing 

[11:24] <darksydephil> they're retarded lol 

[11:25] <darksydephil> they have no evidence of anything, it doesn't even make sense, the IRS couldn't give a 
shit if dumbfuck kids spam them with baseless accusations 

[11:25] <darksydephil> especially when my tax attorney is well respected and does everything right 
[11:26] <darksydephil> no, i didnt talk about my deductions at any time recently, maybe years ago i've 
mentioned having the office is a write-off and the cost of anythign related to the business is. and that's it. very 
general info that is public knowledge 

[11:27] <darksydephil> um, no i didn’t say that, you're a fucking idiot 

[11:28] <darksydephil> if that bundle of paper was purchased exclusively to be stuff for the business, it actually 

would be a write-off. but in that case it wasn't 

[11:29] <darksydephil> okay, everyone ready for prestream? 

[14:10] <darksydephil> no patrons nitpicked 
[14:10] <darksydephil> it was all detractors 
[14:10] <darksydephil> not a single patron complained lol 
[21:08] <darksydephil> another bot bites the dust

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170530-02 FRIDAY THE 13TH 3RD.LOG 

[19:02] <darksydephil> so 

[19:03] <darksydephil> heres why ill be late 

[19:03] <darksydephil> our troll tipper Mort disputed all of his 112 tips since April with Paypal. that's actually 
112 individual crimes lol 

[19:03] <darksydephil> so i have to respond to them all. it takes about 20 seconds per one so ill be a bit here 
[19:04] <darksydephil> yeah its mass fraud 

[19:04] <darksydephil> it would mean serious jailtime if caught and they have his name and address, he’s a 
fucking retard 

[19:05] <darksydephil> in total Mort tipped about $200 over time, and i kept every single dollar in the account in 
case he did this, and now he did 

[19:06] <darksydephil> at the very least his account will be closed 
[19:07] <darksydephil> not potentially, this IS mass fraud 
[19:07] <darksydephil> he’d go to jail for a while if caught 

[19:10] <darksydephil> by the way, I have the guy's real name which he had to give Paypal to send me money 
and then refund it. he’s a literal idiot 

[19:11] <darksydephil> it cant be an alias, its the name of what he used to pay with lol 

[19:14] <darksydephil> the only real hassle to me is diong all these disputes etc 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i kept the money on purpose thinking all along he’d do that 

[19:16] <darksydephil> this guy got 112 on screen messages, so his money is mine, plain and simple. 

[19:20] <darksydephil> it didnt work last time someone did this, and that was about 10 transactions 
[19:22] <darksydephil> Paul and King for sure 
[19:22] <darksydephil> alwasys have been 

[19:24] <darksydephil> since im in the middle of this and it'll be a while, please let me know hwats going on as 
they come in 

[19:24] <darksydephil> i will be streaming after im done with this, but might take a while lol 

[19:24] <darksydephil> and ill stream later than usual no worries 

[19:33] <darksydephil> more than halfway through now btw 

[19:33] <darksydephil> not bored, im reading your convos 

[19:39] <darksydephil> dspfandood you’re completely misinformed on this, lol 

[19:41] <darksydephil> ive got 40 left 

[19:41] <darksydephil> so i already did like 72 

[19:47] <darksydephil> its pretty unbelievable that the invites dont work, on top of all the other problems the 
game has lol 

[19:47] <darksydephil> friday the 13th is literally the SFV of 2017 




[19:47] <darksydephil> same exact situaion 
[19:50] <darksydephil> dont count on it haha 
[19:52] <darksydephil> 18 to go lol 

[19:54] <darksydephil> in that case, a million is "dozens" lol 

[19:57] <darksydephil> on the final 10 now 

[20:04] <darksydephil> stream starting now 

[20:08] <darksydephil> ok resetting cheers 

[20:08] <darksydephil> getting the laptop working now 

[20:08] <darksydephil> hello all 

[20:08] <darksydephil> thanks burnout! 

[22:18] <darksydephil> You do realize the SOK are the reason the shitshow exists and continues, right? They're 
the instigators. I just sit here and play games 

[22:19] <darksydephil> You don’t find videos or streams about drama shit unless it's absolutely necessary. That's 
ALL they put out 

[22:19] <darksydephil> why do you think the fans do it? because the SOK start it and continue with it. It will 
never end until they grow the fuck up and move on from this nonsense 

[22:20] <darksydephil> Yeah, it's entertainment TO YOU. it's my fucking life and so many things have been 
fucked up because of this bullshit that has nothing to do with my daily gaming streams/videos, and it has to 
fucking stop at some point 

[22:21] <darksydephil> how do you think i’ll ever get a job anywhere when as soon as they go to do an internet 
search, they see a million videos saying i’m a pedophile, a masturbated on stream, and i mistreat my girlfriend? 
and then they go out of their way to try and ruin my livelihood by lying to MCNs/attacking them and/or anyone 
associated with me business wise, so i can't get a job other than youtube/twitch but they try to destroy my 
youtube/twitch as well, it's COMPLETELY fucked 

[22:23] <darksydephil> you can only blame the parents, lazy, good for nothing fucks who just popped out kids 
and never taught them morals, so they think its perfectly OKAY to destroy someone's life on the internet for theri 
own jollies, because there’s no reprecussions to them, i wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing i was doing 
something like that 

[22:24] <darksydephil> it's as ive said before, simply put: there are too many humans on earth for every life to be 
meaningful, and when your life has no meaning, you seek to make it mean something, so if the only impactful 
thing you can possibly do in your life is ruin someone else's life from behind your computer, you'll do it so you 
feel like you had some kind of impact on something, otherwise, you're nothing, that's the situation this "tribe" is 
in 

[22:25] <darksydephil> the vast majority of people who dislike me on the internet do so because they actually 
believe some lie about me that isn't true or is a half-truth, and sounds awful out of context, and i have no defense 
at all to any of it 

[22:26] <darksydephil> they won’t stop until they find something else meaningful in their lives to spend their 
time on. I'll give you an example: DarksideGeoff 

[22:27] <darksydephil> he used to bea huge troll of mine, made slanderous lie vids about me back in the days of 
SF4 etc. but he got a life, a job, grew up and now i've had meaningful convos with him. he realized what he did 
was wrong and how bad it's gotten with this new group and apologized to me for it 

[22:27] <darksydephil> or how about DasBoSchitt who was a HUUUUGE critic of mine, even made skit videos 

about what i was doing was wrong on YT. but then talked with me, saw i wanted to improve and DID improve, 

and completely changed his attitude, shit he's a patron of mine 

[22:31] <darksydephil> it WAS about video length for like 2 years 

[22:32] <darksydephil> it just recently changed last year to engagement rate 

[22:32] <darksydephil> so, what % of your vids actually gets watched 

[22:32] <darksydephil> the shorter the vid, the higher chance for higher engagement 

[22:34] <darksydephil> yeah we didnt’ see it on our end 

[22:37] <darksydephil> Micgelo09 : it's about the overall body of work. I’ve individually played more games and 
created more playthroughs than any one person on the internet. Sure, you can argue that they edit their videos 
and therefore more effort goes into each individual vid. But that's never what I've been about. I work just as hard, 



if not HARDER, than the video editor guys. They have a ton of style and far less substance than what I put out, 
so tos peak.
