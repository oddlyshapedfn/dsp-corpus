hello! 

Check the individual logs for any context you need. 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171101 DAY OFF, THROAT ISSUES.LOG 

[17:40] <darksydephil> yeah sorry all, throat is swollen, makes sense to just save my voice and hopefully im 
better tomorrow 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171102-01 MARIO ODYSSEY 3RD.LOG 

[12:25] <darksydephil> wassap 

[12:25] <darksydephil> setting up now folks! 

[12:26] <darksydephil> the one year crowns have arrived!!! 

[12:26] <darksydephil> very nice, i like them 
[12:28] <darksydephil> well heres the deal 

[12:29] <darksydephil> i dont have a typical sore throat this time, in fact im not really gunked up at all 
[12:29] <darksydephil> my lefthand side of my throat is swollen, its the glands, meaning i have a viral infection 
[12:29] <darksydephil> i can feel the swollen lymph node on that side 

[12:29] <darksydephil> so talking it doesn't even effect, its not like a raspy or irritated throat, ive had this before 
and its rare, its not the typical issue i get 

[12:30] <darksydephil> okay, please send me $lk so i can go to the doctor tomorrow lol 
[12:30] <darksydephil> lymph nodes always swell during an infection 

[12:30] <darksydephil> its actually if you have swollen nodes and no pain that you need to worry 
[12:31] <darksydephil> i.e. it could be something serious 

[12:31] <darksydephil> but since ive got obvious throat swelling and pain it makes sense 

[12:31] <darksydephil> i should be fine for streaming, since its not the actual raspyness o fthe throat or anything, 
i just have to take it easy and let the infection ride itself out 

[12:32] <darksydephil> if it doesn't go away, then ill go to the doctor but ive had this before and it always does 

[12:32] <darksydephil> not for the self employed aproxymate, we get the worst insurance in the nation 

[12:33] <darksydephil> for me to do anything except the yearly checkup, its "coinsurance" meaning the 

insurance only pays a certain amount and ill still get hundreds if not thousands of dollars in bills 

[12:33] <darksydephil> thats why in 2015 with my foot, i paid over $ lk 

[12:33] <darksydephil> i had an xray, blood test, and then the meds. nothing was covered 

[12:34] <darksydephil> btw there should be two changes today, we’ll see 

[12:34] <darksydephil> first change is, if someone tips me, it now says that in the stream chat along with their 
message 

[12:34] <darksydephil> it ties in with nightbot to do that 

[12:34] <darksydephil> second change is, if someone pledges to patreon its apparently supposed to tie in with 
muxy but 

[12:35] <darksydephil> muxy doesn't even explain HOW. it might just be tracked but not displayed, i see no 
option to do a pop-up thank you for that 

[12:35] <darksydephil> yeah theres no way to know until i try it out 
[12:35] <darksydephil> i definitely linked it 

[12:35] <darksydephil> in fact let me take a look right now be someone actually pledged this morning 
[12:37] <darksydephil> yeah i literally see nothing about patreon in muxy. seems like its a good idea they haven't 
implemented yet 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay is the stream working? 

[12:39] <darksydephil> okay ill tweet out the stream 
[12:44] <darksydephil> i just chugged my tea lol 
[12:44] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab a seltzer and then start 
[13:17] <darksydephil> testing the crown 


#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171102-02 CODWWII 1ST.LOG 






[20:22] <darksydephil> who's ready for some COD action? 

[20:23] <darksydephil> okay, settle down, stop getting all excited 
[20:23] <darksydephil>. 

[20:24] <darksydephil> oh yeah, let me check muxy quick and see if it says anything about patreon 
[20:25] <darksydephil> nope, i dont get this at all 

[20:25] <darksydephil> why allow me to link my patreon if it doesn’t actually do anything with it lol. pretty lame 
[20:25] <darksydephil> wassap guys, going live shortly 
[20:26] <darksydephil> it tracks nothing 

[20:26] <darksydephil> theres nothing anywhere in it that has any data on patreon, lol 
[20:26] <darksydephil> it allows you to link patreon and thats it 
[20:26] <darksydephil> makes zero sense, mayb ethey'll implement it in the future 
[20:33] <darksydephil> ONE MORE TIME

[12:37] <darksydephil> BTW i’m up to 291 subs now, a new record, if we get a few more, I hit 300 sub points, 
which means i get more emotes and stuff unlocked for subscribers 

[12:39] <darksydephil> i usually get a good number of new followers daily, although a lot of them are probably 
hots 

[12:40] <darksydephil> stream up and running for everyone? 

[12:41] <darksydephil> also daylight saving time ends tonight 
[12:41] <darksydephil> which means in hte USA our clocks roll back an hour

[19:32] <darksydephil> nice 

[19:32] <darksydephil> setting up now for more MP

[19:33] <darksydephil> btw we’re now up to 295 subs! 

[19:33] <darksydephil> so close to 300

[19:41] <darksydephil> cool ill tweet it out, maybe we can hit 300 subs tonight! 

[19:41] <darksydephil> Zahvone it's better than every modern-esque COD besides Modern warfare IMO 
[19:41] <darksydephil> but i thi nk the original games just had charm in their simplicity 

[19:43] <darksydephil> just watch American Beauty over and over, Spacey is a complete scumbag in that one so 
it feels good lol 

[19:44] <darksydephil> yeah thats a movie of like, all realistic villains 

[19:44] <darksydephil> i bet its not just guys either, its just anyone in power, they abuse that shit all the time i’m 
sure but nobody says shit be everyone wants to work 

[19:45] <darksydephil> look at Toby Turner, guy only had a stupid as fuck youtube channel but even he did 
fucked up stuff to girls who were just starstruck, or knew he was their ticket to fame

[12:25] <darksydephil> wassap 
[12:25] <darksydephil> setting up now 

[12:26] <darksydephil> wondering how close i am to the end of wolfenstein ii 

[12:31] <darksydephil> last nights sonic stream was pretty wild 

[12:31] <darksydephil> if you guys weren’t here youw ant to check out those vids lol 

[12:34] <darksydephil> i tweeted the stream out 

[12:35] <darksydephil> brb gonna grab drinks 

[12:37] <darksydephil> refresh the page 

[12:37] <darksydephil> its a twitch glitch with the new beta that they launched for everyone 
[12:38] <darksydephil> a simple refresh fixes it 
[12:39] <darksydephil> i didnt make this 

[12:39] <darksydephil> this is a playlist of remixes from 2010 lol 
[12:39] <darksydephil> fans used to make them 
[12:39] <darksydephil> mass effect 1 

[12:40] <darksydephil> aproxymate: in 2011 youtube changed channel pages, they stopped being like social 
media pages such as myspace/facebook so it was impossible to get other peoples videos noticed anymore, these 
vids used to blow up when i highlighted them on darksydephil but then it was impossible to get them noticed on 
dspgaming after the change, so they died out bigtime 

[12:41] <darksydephil> i stopped doing full reviews be they get demonetized 
[12:41] <darksydephil> all of my vlogs do 

[12:41] <darksydephil> but ill be doing game of the year awards at teh end of the year and talking about a ton of 
the big releases this year 

[12:42] <darksydephil> this is actually a NEW remix from Sbeastmusic 

[12:42] <darksydephil> he made it early this year but nobody knew, he didnt even tell me 

[12:44] <darksydephil> okay last remix for this prestream 

[12:45] <darksydephil> this is one of my big faves TBH

[12:28] <darksydephil> that starts monday 

[12:29] <darksydephil> people told me it's awful lol 

[12:34] <darksydephil> Ornightz , exactly how many good remixes do you think exist? 

[12:34] <darksydephil> the playlist has 17 of them, there were maybe 25 made total, i picked the best ones 
[12:35] <darksydephil> of course they're going to repeat, you may as well state the sky is blue and grass is green 
[12:35] <darksydephil> it's not very productive 
[12:35] <darksydephil> okay then, stop complaining lol 

[12:35] <darksydephil> there is no alan wake remix, what your'e talking about is at the end of the game review 
and was never separated into its own video, one person remixed it but it wasn't very good 
[12:39] <darksydephil> the port is awful 

[12:39] <darksydephil> it doesn’t even run at a consistent 30fps on switch lol 

[12:39] <darksydephil> um, DOOM is also locked at 30fps on switch, that's horrendous for DOOM

can’t find a definitive answer 

[12:32] <darksydephil> i guess i can start capturing at 30 and then change it if its 60...damn 

[12:33] <darksydephil> thats a different game ratchefanl2 lol

[12:52] <darksydephil> that took forever, the site is massively delayed 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171118-02 SW BATTLEFRONT 2 5TH.LOG 

[19:32] <darksydephil> yo 
[19:33] <darksydephil> yup 

[19:36] <darksydephil> i hope there's still a stage where you play as Vader, and he spends 20 minutes running 
around collecting items instead of fighting. Kind of like Luke lighting bugs 
[19:36] <darksydephil> it'd be the culmination of what all star wars fans want! 

[19:37] <darksydephil> well im about to use Lando so.... 

[19:37] <darksydephil> i guess we’ll see how it goes lol 
[19:38] <darksydephil> hes his grandson 

[19:41] <darksydephil> lol this fucking captain alpacino guy, im so done with him 

[19:41] <darksydephil> so he's been hounding me multiple times a day to play SW battlefront ii MP with me 
despite the fact ive explained to him 3 times that im not going to do any coop or team MP 
[19:42] <darksydephil> he still thinks he should be able to. so i stopped responding to his stupid emails, and now 
he's threatened to pull his patron pledge 

[19:42] <darksydephil> in his THIRD EMAIL to me today, by the way 

[19:42] <darksydephil> so he thinks that threatening me is going to get him into MP tomorrow, yeah, i dont 








respond well to threats lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> he literally just said "i will be pulling my pledge on patreon and no longer supporting 
you unless you have me in MP tomorrow" 

[19:43] <darksydephil> thats a direct threat lol 

[19:44] <darksydephil> this is after i told him i'm not doing MP with ANYBODY , not just him. he thinks he’ 
special and deserves it lol 

[19:44] <darksydephil> when you get that kind of behavior, that's when you know to just distance yourself as 
much as you can 

[19:48] <darksydephil> ok i updated stream title, i guess it didnt save the first time 
[19:59] <darksydephil> my mic died lol

asking, its part for the course 

[12:29] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea yet 

[12:29] <darksydephil> the tax attorney was assuming it would be around $5k but he has no idea what the 
interest, fees etc will end up being and if he can get them waived, and also if he gets on a payment plan for how 
long it would be

[12:32] <darksydephil> so anybody know if this game runs at 30 or 60fps? im going to assume 30 
[12:34] <darksydephil> TheNewFaceofCreation your question is incredibly dumb, unless you think google is 
going to buy out all of amazon, who owns twitch 
[12:34] <darksydephil> why would i respond? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> no, do i work at twitch? why would i care?

[12:38] <darksydephil> stream working all? 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171128-02 NFS PAYBACK 7TH.LOG 

[19:34] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:34] <darksydephil> i was just finishing up with the Hidden Agenda vids 
[19:34] <darksydephil> time to get this started up now! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171129-01 HORIZON ZD TFW 1ST.LOG 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so I completely forgot to upload the unboxing of my a40 mod kit and the installation 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so im doing it right now 

[12:27] <darksydephil> then the stream will start 

[12:27] <darksydephil> its almost done 

[12:33] <darksydephil> okay stream time 

[12:41] <darksydephil> well in hte mainstream marvel universe, nobody has ever been beaten while wearing the 
gauntlet 

[12:41] <darksydephil> they have to be fooled somehow to get it off of them to lose 
[12:42] <darksydephil> and sadly the people whove worn it were all dumb lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171130-01 HORIZON ZD TFW 2ND.LOG 

[12:29] <darksydephil> wassap everybody 

[12:31] <darksydephil> its hard to tell because again, i dont know if everybody will clear or not. if everybody 
does, we will hit the goal. It looks like about $300 has cleared so far this month from people upping their 
pledges. So it needs about $950 to clear and we do have that pledged, but WILL it clear is the question? 

[12:32] <darksydephil> so when the stream goes live, you guys can start messing with the new Live Pet extension 
[12:32] <darksydephil> i think it becomes interactive when the stream starts 

[12:33] <darksydephil> FYI i’m not getting paid for it, but if you spend money on it (i think there are 3 options?) 
i get a cut. But I'm not asking you to do that, i’m just curious it if even works because Kappa Pet didn’t 
[12:42] <darksydephil> i thi nk Live pet is supposed to evolve every 5th or 10th level 
[12:42] <darksydephil> i forgot lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> damn it salready almost level 5 lol 
[12:44] <darksydephil> try refreshing, its level 4 on mine 
[15:30] <darksydephil> are you guys like 5 years old? lol 

[15:30] <darksydephil> people know my address and what mall i live near, someone might take a pic of me if 

they recognize me. how is this a big deal 

[16:02] <darksydephil> sounds like a twitch issue 

[16:02] <darksydephil> be i have nothing wrong with my sound 


#DARKSYDEPHIL 20171130-02 NFS PAYBACK 8TH.LOG 








[19:32] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:33] <darksydephil> going to add the HZD vids to playlis tand then get started here 
[19:37] <darksydephil> im buying a new car, theres no way to beat it with the audi 
[19:37] <darksydephil> that much is clear now 

[19:38] <darksydephil> now guys, remember to play with the new pet when the stream starts lol 
[19:39] <darksydephil> no I goofed, i just renamed the stream to need for speed 
[19:41] <darksydephil> it could be, i dunno, its a beta 
[19:41] <darksydephil> testing 

[19:41] <darksydephil> ive played enough danganronpa for a long while, thanks 

[19:43] <darksydephil> okay the Live Pet enabled lol 

[19:43] <darksydephil> time to click that shit 

[19:43] <darksydephil> hes below the stream 

[19:43] <darksydephil> only if you're on the desktop website though 

[19:43] <darksydephil> doesn’t work on mobile 

[19:44] <darksydephil> correct, unless you purchase a micro transaction 

[19:44] <darksydephil> then you can unlock it and click it nonstop for like 5 minutes 

[19:44] <darksydephil> is that a common emote pops? 

[19:45] <darksydephil> if so it actually might, it evolves into all of the common ones 
[19:48] <darksydephil> OMG I can see what the live pet turns into at level 35, LOL 
[19:48] <darksydephil> wait until you see haha 

[19:48] <darksydephil> but yeah, its basically all of the common emotes, changing at every 5 levels 
[19:48] <darksydephil> it ends at level 135 i think 
[19:49] <darksydephil> OMG boost time! 

[19:49] <darksydephil> click it like crazy! 

[19:50] <darksydephil> get the pet up tp level 35 !
