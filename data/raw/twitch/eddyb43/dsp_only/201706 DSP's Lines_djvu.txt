-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170601-01 PERSONA 5 24TH.LOG 

[11:01] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:02] <darksydephil> you should probably get that looked into, sounds like a personal prob 
[11:02] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:04] <darksydephil> damn, so far we haven’t hit the patreon goal, in fact we may be far off 

[11:05] <darksydephil> no, as ive said many times, my public facing total is completely wrong, patreon fed it up 

over time and it's not correct at all, plus tons of people get declined 

[11:05] <darksydephil> it looks like over $ 100 was declined 

[11:06] <darksydephil> the whole thing is fucked up, ive got THREE different pledge amounts showing on 3 
different pages of the site 

[11:07] <darksydephil> it looks like a ton of people pulled their pledges in the last 1-2 days because it dropped 
by some 20 patrons total 

[11:07] <darksydephil> and thats why we didn’t hit the goal 

[11:09] <darksydephil> well im going to message the people who were declined and see if some of those will 
clear up 

[11:09] <darksydephil> and then i have to do some math, the site is such a mess its impossible to tell how much 

you actually made in a month at a glance 

[11:09] <darksydephil> we may have hit it narrowly 

[11:12] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:12] <darksydephil> well i messaged all the patrons who were declined 
[11:12] <darksydephil> ill set up thes tream now, should be live shortly 
[11:18] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone?

subbed 

[18:53] <darksydephil> well i have no plans for online yet anyway 

[18:54] <darksydephil> ill probably try some character stories and maybe see what other modes there are sine ei 
have no idea 

[18:55] <darksydephil> wow, apparently, unlockable in Tekken 7 is every single ending from every tekken game 
ever 

[18:55] <darksydephil> thats nuts 

[18:56] <darksydephil> yeah venomous fatman just sent me his guide in progress 

[18:56] <darksydephil> it even has cutscenes and anime from pachinko games only in japan lol 

[19:04] <darksydephil> ok 

[19:04] <darksydephil> stream should be starting shortly 

[19:08] <darksydephil> it was just a bunch of dumbfucks who know nothin about fighting games trying to act 
like they did because Shin Akuma is an insanely tough optional boss 

[19:08] <darksydephil> nothing too special, considering it happens every time i play fighting games 
[19:11] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[19:11] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet that we're live 
[19:12] <darksydephil> ok i tweeted that we’re live 
[19:12] <darksydephil> lol

[19:13] <darksydephil> enough of that clown 
[19:13] <darksydephil> oh look atnoher one 

[19:13] <darksydephil> how do you think he'll feel to know nobody read his paragraph? lol 

[19:14] <darksydephil> YuichiMcCry you are misinformed on many levels lol 

[19:14] <darksydephil> i dont live in Portland to begin with 

[19:14] <darksydephil> the weather has cooled down a bit which is nice 

[19:15] <darksydephil> lol bentboxer 

[19:15] <darksydephil> not exactly a huge deal 

[19:15] <darksydephil> proposing to me? 

[19:15] <darksydephil> i haven't heard any offers yet from qualified suitors, i need to review their dowries first 
to see if they're sufficient 

[19:16] <darksydephil> the trolling doesn't even make sense anymore 

[19:16] <darksydephil> why dont they just smash their keyboards with random letter confgurations at this point 
[19:17] <darksydephil> i love kebabs, we have a few good middle eastern/meditteranean food places around here 
[19:18] <darksydephil> unless I fell back into a bad financial position wehre i couldn't afford my bills, i’d be a 
madman to sell this house right now. the market value is skyrocketing and still on a massive upward trend 
[19:20] <darksydephil> ok time to start talking, let me go to the dashboard som people can hear me 
[19:20] <darksydephil> YuichiMcCry you are seriously behind on everything, read my twitter from 2 days ago 
for the real story and that's it. no info was ever revealed outside of that post so anything anybody else says is 
bullshit, and this is not hte place to ask either 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170603-01 TEKKEN 7 3RD.LOG 

[11:15] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:18] <darksydephil> yup im setting up right now 

[11:22] <darksydephil> YOU GOING ONLINE BEFORE YOU’VE EVEN TRIED OUT ANY CHARACTERS 
PHIL? YOU AFRAID? 

[11:22] <darksydephil> what a fuckwad 

[11:23] <darksydephil> thats what id expect chrisbreezyOO 

[11:23] <darksydephil> yes, by playing the story mode of the game, i have instantly absorbed all top level 
strategies and mastered the art of combat 
[11:23] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:24] <darksydephil> id say they're about the same jackwhite202 . both kind of shitty 
[11:26] <darksydephil> okay stream working for everyone? 

[11:26] <darksydephil> i wonder if tekken 7 still has just frames or if they got rid of them 
[11:26] <darksydephil> i never mastered them in the previous games 

[11:28] <darksydephil> no pureo nikku , just frames are specific special moves that require incredibly precise 
timing to pull off consistently, but are usually quite rewarding 
[11:28] <darksydephil> stream working well ? 

[11:28] <darksydephil> ok cool, time to tweet 

[11:29] <darksydephil> i actually did pretty well on pad, yesterday, considering i beat shin akuma 
[11:30] <darksydephil> im about to start drinking mattty3888 lol 
[11:30] <darksydephil> hello simpo98 

[11:31] <darksydephil> probably jackwhite202 , hes one of the characters i use dto play with 

[11:31] <darksydephil> im thinking paul, king, bob, yoshi, eliza, lili, and miguel may be who i try to play with. 

we’ll see 

[11:32] <darksydephil> oh yeah, maybe AKUMA BABY and Heihachi too 
[11:32] <darksydephil> i like heihachi be he's a hybrid 
[11:32] <darksydephil> anyone remember that reference? lol 
[11:33] <darksydephil> that guy was seriously braindead haha 

[11:33] <darksydephil> LOL oh god, waaaaay back to the Bridgeport days, ghetto ass fools outside making a 
ruckus at like midnight 

[11:34] <darksydephil> nothing tzutfzuztu , im going to do it eventually as long as you dont pester me 




[11:34] <darksydephil> if you do, ill delay online play longer and longer 
[11:34] <darksydephil> thanks mxavier91 ! 

[11:35] <darksydephil> oop! you just pestered me. online play delayed for an extra 30 minutes 
[11:35] <darksydephil> OOP! another pestering! thats another 30 minutes 

[11:36] <darksydephil> i cant review friday the 13th, the game is far from complete and everyone knows it 
[11:36] <darksydephil> i miss indestructible, those days we’ll never get back lol 
[11:38] <darksydephil> tekken always had weirdos lol 

[16:05] <darksydephil> how exactly did any of those games work? either super slow mo or no low blocks lol. 
this game is complete shit online right now 

[16:07] <darksydephil> "you got legit outplayed" Every hit was low because it wouldn’t block due to delay. 

Okay, if you think that's being outplayed, it just shows you're a dumbass lol 

[16:09] <darksydephil> yes, spamming low attacks and doing one juggle combo online means you're an amazing 

tekken player, sorry i forgot, its not about strategy or anything lol 

[16:09] <darksydephil> some serious uneducated idiots, but im used to it 

[16:09] <darksydephil> yeah im gonna turn off the stream and strat uploading 

[16:09] <darksydephil> start 

[16:10] <darksydephil> Thirtysixhundredcalories because IT LAGS, dummy, lol damn your head is empty ain't it 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170603-02 TEKKEN 7 4TH.LOG 

[19:11] <darksydephil> hello all 

[19:11] <darksydephil> setting up now, sorry i lost track of time making the shopping list for tomorrow lol 
[19:13] <darksydephil> the online isn't going to work, im going to try 1-2 new characters and do their arcade 
ladders i guess, maybe more, dunno how long the ladders are 
[19:18] <darksydephil> okay 

[19:18] <darksydephil> can finally get the stream started 
[19:22] <darksydephil> ok stream should be live 
[19:22] <darksydephil> it's TOO live 

[19:24] <darksydephil> this music is by a band comprised of Roger, Alex and Dr. Bosconovitch 
[19:25] <darksydephil> ok so stream looks good? ill tweet that we’re live 
[19:29] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 
[19:29] <darksydephil> and ill start in a minute 

[20:39] <darksydephil> well siegmare perhaps you should use your brain, this is a tekken 7 stream, not one about 
my love lie. asking about it here is stupid 
[22:05] <darksydephil> what? 

[22:05] <darksydephil> it has input showing, and the ps4 online play should eventually work 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170604-01 TEKKEN 7 5TH.LOG 

[12:10] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[12:10] <darksydephil> setting up now! sorry about late start 

[12:11] <darksydephil> today is just a bunch of MP anyway 

[12:11] <darksydephil> so its not like there was a major time constraint, i do apologize that the stream started 
late though 

[12:12] <darksydephil> yes im aware Derich lol 

[12:12] <darksydephil> it was just one of those nights, got caught up in doing shit around the house, got too 
much adrenaline pumping, next thing i know its super late and i cant sleep 
[12:13] <darksydephil> ive got bags under my eyes today lol 
[12:16] <darksydephil> okay lets get this stream started 

[12:19] <darksydephil> LOL some guy posted on the forums inquiring about all kinds of personal shit 
[12:19] <darksydephil> is this really what we've come to? i thought it was about my streams and videos, not 
about knowing every single aspect of my personal life 
[12:20] <darksydephil> these people have issues man 
[12:20] <darksydephil> its definitely obsession at this point 





[12:21] <darksydephil> i mean just to give some perspective, i said i wouldn’t talk about what car i got. these 
people did everything in their power to try and figure it out regardless of the fact it has nothing to do with 
anything relating to them, why? just because they felt they could, that's mental illness 
[12:22] <darksydephil> they are completely and hopelessly infatuated and obsessed with me. this is sick shit 
man. this goes beyond celeb stalker shit 

[12:23] <darksydephil> they apparently called the real estate company that was trying to short sell my condo on 
their podcast just because they could....the fuck? 

[12:24] <darksydephil> so is the stream working? i see its running but its saying 0 viewers lol 

[12:24] <darksydephil> no stream? wtf 

[12:25] <darksydephil> ok ill restart OBS 

[12:25] <darksydephil> it may be a twitch side issue 

[12:26] <darksydephil> yeah wtf, now my stream is offline but the dashboard is saying im still broadcasting, the 
site is all messe dup today 

[12:27] <darksydephil> hey TheNewFaceofCreation didnt i JUST CALL YOU OUT for being a constant 

douchebag the other day? and you certainly haven't improved your attitude 

[12:27] <darksydephil> either grow up or you'll be banned 

[12:27] <darksydephil> im honestly tired of your shit at this point 

[12:27] <darksydephil> every word out of your mouth is an annoying insult 

[12:28] <darksydephil> no, you fucking weren't joking, adding a kappa at the end of every insulting line you type 
doesn't make it a joke, it's just a cop out and i’m done putting up with your shit 
[12:29] <darksydephil> now start acting like a fucking mature adult or say goodbye 
[12:29] <darksydephil> BTW the stream is definitely live now, i see viewers 

[12:30] <darksydephil> LOL no, this has nothing to do with not having enough sleep and everything to do with 
being systematically insulted and abused by the same guy over and over and im done putting up with it 
[12:30] <darksydephil> a kappa face is not a shield against retribution for insults 
[12:31] <darksydephil> okay so stream working now? 

[12:33] <darksydephil> lol TheNewFaceofCreation i already called you out for this, you were well aware of the 
situation, its your own fault you're in this situation now. so you can either grow up or go bye bye, your choice, 
and an apology would probably be warranted now 

[12:33] <darksydephil> anyway, running to grab drinks before we start, brb 

[13:31] <darksydephil> no ThatWouldBeGrand you're wrong 

[13:31] <darksydephil> that doesn't have an effect on in game lobbies 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170605-01 TEKKEN 7 6TH.LOG 

[11:11] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[11:11] <darksydephil> uuuh no, thats pretty sick sissydiejungwkaiserin , id probably stay away from that kind 
of stuff 

[11:14] <darksydephil> id play sonic adventure 1/2 for sure 
[11:14] <darksydephil> that would be pretty fun 

[11:15] <darksydephil> how long is sonic adventure 1 ? i haven’t played it in so long i forget 

[11:16] <darksydephil> i guess people like SA2 over 1? i never played 2, only had a burnt copy that crapped out 

after a few hours due to glitches 

[11:17] <darksydephil> so how about hte funding goal for june is a full playthrough of SA2 that starts either in 

late july or early august? it’d match the sonic 06 event from last year 

[11:18] <darksydephil> sounds like a plan, ill have to work something up for it 

[11:19] <darksydephil> thanks RetroCerverus and MsMonique for your support! 

[11:19] <darksydephil> yes Zahvone 

[11:19] <darksydephil> yeah i know they were redone in HD pimpkings 
[11:19] <darksydephil> my ps3 still works, its just not reliable so much 
[11:20] <darksydephil> so i avoid it when i can 
[11:24] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[11:24] <darksydephil> ok cool, ill tweet that we’re live and then grab some drinks 




[11:26] <darksydephil> ok brb, grabbing drinks 

[11:32] <darksydephil> they're just dumb fuck kids talking shit on the net, i mean, showing up in person not only 
would get them arrested but possibly hurt IRL. and pussies wouldn’t ever chance that 
[11:32] <darksydephil> i know JasonBiggs64 i saw your messgae yesterday here 

[11:33] <darksydephil> first of all, these dumb kids dont seem to realize i live in a private community, which 

means we have cameras everywhere and a security system installe din every house lol. morons 

[11:34] <darksydephil> if they tried to break in they'd be arrested most likely if they even touched a door 

[11:36] <darksydephil> there's no such thing as "joking about sneaking into Phil’s house." that's not joking, 

because its not funny, it's premeditated crime, even if you're just fucking around, and they need to fucking realize 

that, because it's SICK thinking. 

[11:36] <darksydephil> i'm sure the Columbine shooters were "just joking" about shooting up their school when 
they were planning it to. then they actually made the bombs, bought hte guns and did it. planning stuff like that is 
the first step to insanity. 

[11:37] <darksydephil> anybody else want to fuck around? just joking. 

[11:37] <darksydephil> any more? 

[11:38] <darksydephil> please reveal yourselves now so i can ban you 
[11:38] <darksydephil> okay, time to start prestream 

[11:38] <darksydephil> btw gonna change the schedule a bit, ill explain on prestream 

[13:02] <darksydephil> Gino 

[13:02] <darksydephil> wtf are you doing 

[13:03] <darksydephil> you're a mod, stop spamming the chat 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170605-02 TEKKEN 7 7TH.LOG 

[18:59] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:00] <darksydephil> so i think ill try Bob and Lili tonight 

[19:00] <darksydephil> practice, arcade and maybe a bit of online if I think i've gotten them down enough 

[19:03] <darksydephil> oh, i can't do more treasure battle 

[19:03] <darksydephil> because it continues the streak, it didnt end 

[19:03] <darksydephil> so it'd be like playing new characters against the much harder AI, i’d get stomped 
[19:03] <darksydephil> it is?? 

[19:04] <darksydephil> i was told the streak just runs endlessly until you lose no matter who you pick 
[19:04] <darksydephil> be tonight i wanted to practice with bob/lili and tomorrow do MP with them 
[19:04] <darksydephil> if i try it and it doesn't reset, i'm fucked, i’ll lose my stream 
[19:04] <darksydephil> streak 

[19:05] <darksydephil> yeah be rewards are random except for the ones that are specific to your character 
[19:05] <darksydephil> if you quit mid-match it'd count as a loss i think 
[19:06] <darksydephil> we can try it i guess lol 

[19:07] <darksydephil> nah i tnever had a release date, which is what i kept saying but people kept telling me it 
did lol 

[19:07] <darksydephil> im sure the match will be a speed up, double damage match against panda 
[19:12] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[19:12] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet that we’re live 
[19:13] <darksydephil> the stream community here is great 

[19:14] <darksydephil> it's the youtube community that's toxic as shit, all the morons stayed there while all the 
nice people gravitated over here 

[19:16] <darksydephil> ok laptop is almost up and running 

[19:17] <darksydephil> sorry to hear that Ornightz . hopefully something i do tonight can help you out in some 
way

own world and i'm not even a part of it, despite them only talking about me constantly lol 

[11:35] <darksydephil> all i know is i've been covering tekken 7 and enjoying myself 

[11:38] <darksydephil> ok ready for prestream? 

[15:14] <darksydephil> ive had enough of his shit 
[15:14] <darksydephil> i warned him TONS of times 

[15:15] <darksydephil> delta is just a fucking idiot who can't grow up and keep his mouth shut. ALL he does is 
talk shit and i’ve given him far too many warnings 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170607 PERCEPTION CANCELLED, THROAT ISSUES.LOG 

[10:51] <darksydephil> ugh, not looking good folks 

[10:51] <darksydephil> my throat is swollen and scratchy, i can barely talk 
[10:51] <darksydephil> allergies are really killing me 

[10:52] <darksydephil> yeah and im not the only one, its major news that pollen is going nuts in Washington 
right now and everyone is suffering

[12:10] <darksydephil> OMFG the SFW Battalion! 

[12:10] <darksydephil> FINALLY 

[12:10] <darksydephil> fuck i mean SJW lol 

[12:10] <darksydephil> so amazing, a total non-announcement 

[12:11] <darksydephil> i like battlefield 1 but EA needs to realize, 8 months after release an FPS is dead 
[12:11] <darksydephil> i am taking notes actually 
[12:12] <darksydephil> yeah nobody clapped at all lol 
[12:12] <darksydephil> is this guy alive? 

[12:13] <darksydephil> he looks and acts like a zombi 
[12:13] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> make stars of all of their players? nobody knows who the fuck these kids are 

[12:13] <darksydephil> and nobody cares 

[12:13] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:13] <darksydephil> the best fuck players? 

[12:14] <darksydephil> yay, EA once again not getting that advertising this competitive gaming doesn't sell their 
games at E3 

[12:14] <darksydephil> idots 

[12:15] <darksydephil> they gave them a fucking plate as a trophy hahaha. "put your doritos on here when you 
wash them down with fanta tomorrow" 

[12:16] <darksydephil> poor Venomousfatman is in the audience for this, how is he awake? 

[12:17] <darksydephil> what he fuck is this 
[12:18] <darksydephil> nobody knows who you are.... 

[12:18] <darksydephil> why are they doing this 

[12:18] <darksydephil> its bad, dry, british humor that isn't funny and an american audience doesn’t get. 
PERFECT FOR E3! 

[12:19] <darksydephil> we’re american, we need GIRL BONER humor 
[12:20] <darksydephil> i have no idea wtf they're talking about 
[12:20] <darksydephil> so its career mode right? 

[12:21] <darksydephil> i dont think EA should have gone first....lol

[12:23] <darksydephil> nobody knows who the fuck this guy is and nobody cares 
[12:24] <darksydephil> EA screwed the pooch 

[12:24] <darksydephil> EA wants to pretend that they're "in touch" with the common gamer by having all these 
nobodys on their conference 

[12:25] <darksydephil> in reality it shows how out of touch they are 
[12:25] <darksydephil> what was this guys name, Jesse what? 

[12:25] <darksydephil> i didnt catch it 
[12:25] <darksydephil> thanks

[12:29] <darksydephil> "my daughter kept asking if she could call her boyfriend, so i tied her to the couch and 
played by myself while she was forced to watch" 

[12:30] <darksydephil> prison anal sex simulator! FINALLY

[12:32] <darksydephil> this is cool except couch coop died, soooo yeah

[12:33] <darksydephil> "we tried to beat A Way Out but god damn it, we just kept fucking each toehr before we 
finished" 

[12:34] <darksydephil> yeah this guy is cool, and the game concept is good, so thumbs up for this one 
[12:35] <darksydephil> i really like this concept, but i predict a ton of funny bugs, especially if you’re playing 
online and it desynchs

[12:40] <darksydephil> oh fuck me, nobody cares about nba live 

[12:40] <darksydephil> let's announce a new bioware IP for 10 seconds, then immediately spend a ton of time on 
an IP nobody cares about 

[12:41] <darksydephil> they dont ever need to show these sports games, people/fans of the series buy them 
regardless, this is always huge wasted time and they do it every single year 

[12:43] <darksydephil> oh the streets you ONLY get respect if you're at home playing video games! 

[12:44] <darksydephil> im already zoned out and not paying any attention to this, and i know im missing not hing 
[12:44] <darksydephil> "after the street game ends, you can eitehr go to work like a responsible adult, or sell 
weed on the street corner, its the most realistic sim yet!"

[12:48] <darksydephil> ITS A WERMAN! 

[12:48] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:50] <darksydephil> oh boy more "battlefront and chill" action! 

[12:50] <darksydephil> gotta show her my wookie 



[12:50] <darksydephil> Demarcus Yoda LOL 

[12:51] <darksydephil> she's trying to make jokes and every one fell flat 

[12:52] <darksydephil> "three times the content, but if you want it all, the season pass edition is $249.99" 

[12:53] <darksydephil> are these more fucking youtubers? 

[12:53] <darksydephil> lol 

[12:53] <darksydephil> DROIDS VS CLONES 

[12:54] <darksydephil> ugh my stream buffered lol 

[12:54] <darksydephil> um those duels dont actually happen, that was cgi bullshit lol 
[12:55] <darksydephil> what the fuck?! 

[12:55] <darksydephil> that was the emperor! 

[12:55] <darksydephil> "my mom is here to see all you nerds lust over me, must be so proud!" 

[12:55] <darksydephil> IJUSTINE WHAT THE FUCK 
[12:55] <darksydephil> are they fucking retarded? 

[12:57] <darksydephil> wow, so ALL die is free? 

[12:58] <darksydephil> WOW they actually listened 
[12:58] <darksydephil> amazing 

[12:58] <darksydephil> "for years to come" aka for 1 month and then when dies release for a day 
[12:59] <darksydephil> ijustine! OH FUCKING BOY I CANT WAIT 
[13:01] <darksydephil> what the fuck was that?! LOLOL 
[13:01] <darksydephil> HAH AH AH A 

[13:02] <darksydephil> yes everyone, i admit, that is really me playing 
[13:03] <darksydephil> these people have no idea how to play in the vehicles lol 
[13:03] <darksydephil> WHOA the stream just cut ahead lol 
[13:04] <darksydephil> yeah at least this isn't scripted lol 

[13:05] <darksydephil> ijustine has never added anything of quality to anything, she was in teh right place at the 
right time, she started "gaming" on youtube when it was becoming popular and be she had a pretty face, all the 
fucking nerds watched her and she got famous based solely off of that, she's awful at games and is not any 
authority at anything, but she's good at speaking so she gets jobs like this 

[13:06] <darksydephil> just like toby turner, ijustice wasn't even doing gaming on youtube until it could be 

monetized, so ill just leave that there and yeah lol 

[13:07] <darksydephil> i said ijustice instead of ijustine lol 

[13:07] <darksydephil> so this game looks good, but im already bored, you need a real gamer/commentator 
doing the gameplay for it to be good, jumping around makes it boring as you constantly get torn out of the 
situations 

[13:09] <darksydephil> well IMO the game looks good 
[13:10] <darksydephil> ok back, i took a piss be i was bored lol 
[13:11] <darksydephil> ugh buffer 
[13:11] <darksydephil> yeah theres 30 minutes of this lol 
[13:12] <darksydephil> oooh buff classes, i like this 
[13:13] <darksydephil> LOL Rey dies in like 5 seconds 

[13:13] <darksydephil> "how does rey's mind trick affect enemies?" "it doesn't, she’s fucking dead justine" 
[13:14] <darksydephil> yeah this game will be pretty chaotic, this does remind me a bit more of the original 
battlefront though, unlike the last game 
[13:15] <darksydephil> "not bad" 

[13:15] <darksydephil> LOL 

[13:15] <darksydephil> wha tthe fuck this guy works for EA and he said the game is "not bad" 

[13:16] <darksydephil> "my fave part was when NBA Live jumped into the fray!" 

[13:16] <darksydephil> "all you fucks better buy this game, because its all we have this year" 

[13:17] <darksydephil> ijustine only plays games when she can make a huge paycheck 
[13:17] <darksydephil> she's the ultimate sellout 

[13:18] <darksydephil> wait, you can spend a thousand dollars on a game? LOL what great advertisement! let 
your kids start playing it immediately! 



[13:19] <darksydephil> so the highlights of this conference were the Youtuber who forgot his lines, "not bad" 
and "i spent over a thousand dollars on tha game!" 

[13:19] <darksydephil> what the fuck? no audio LOL 

[13:19] <darksydephil> HAHAHAH 

[13:20] <darksydephil> holy fuck look at this woman 

[13:20] <darksydephil> admiral thrawn from the comics, i read that arc 

[13:21] <darksydephil> admiral thrawn found an animal that could negate the force, so he kept them around and 
just slaughteerd the fuck out of all the jedi 

[13:23] <darksydephil> urn....why are they talking massive detail about a mobile game 
[13:23] <darksydephil> its not liek we all play it and know it 

[13:23] <darksydephil> this would be like me announcing a new character in street fighter and getting technical 
about frame data.... 

[13:23] <darksydephil> this isn't relevant bigtone995 
[13:24] <darksydephil> wtf is the conference over? 

[13:24] <darksydephil> i think it is 

[13:24] <darksydephil> but its just going and going 

[13:25] <darksydephil> sooo its over lol. would have been nice if they were like "ITS OVER" 

[13:26] <darksydephil> yes everyone im setting up for my reactions right now 

[13:30] <darksydephil> ok im gonna turn on the stream, then use the restroom, then we can start 

[13:30] <darksydephil> so be patient, it'll be like 10 minutes, also have to brush my hair lol

[14:51] <darksydephil> generic rpg! yay 

[14:52] <darksydephil> whoa holy fuck that combat lol

[14:53] <darksydephil> yeah its out on pc already 
[14:53] <darksydephil> pixels! lol

[14:54] <darksydephil> this must take place in Seattle for sure 

[14:54] <darksydephil> wha thte fuck is this shit 

[14:55] <darksydephil> uuuuuuuh 

[14:56] <darksydephil> another rpg 

[14:56] <darksydephil> isnt this the weeb game from From Software? 

[14:57] <darksydephil> i dont understand it yet, why weren’ thtere tons of twitch streamers and youtubers in this 
conference so far? i thought tha'ts what's "hip" and "in!" 

[14:58] <darksydephil> this....looks boring 

[14:59] <darksydephil> this looks pretty...underwhelming 

[15:00] <darksydephil> the thing is, i dont particularly find pirates that interesting, sooo' 

[15:01] <darksydephil> well yes blue_blur64 because it really wasn't primarily a piraate game, that was just the 
time period 

[15:01] <darksydephil> fuck, i just yawned lol 
[15:02] <darksydephil> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 

[15:02] <darksydephil> this will be a great coop game, because the fun thing about it is dicking about with other 
people since the game is boring as fuck, just like destiny 

[15:04] <darksydephil> this is the first extended gameplay of this game and sadly it seems really boring to me 

[15:05] <darksydephil> ok ship boarding seems like it'll be cool 

[15:05] <darksydephil> except 95% of people will miss and end up in the drink lol 

[15:05] <darksydephil> so you basically just saw ALL of the game 

[15:06] <darksydephil> because what else do pirates do? lol 

[15:06] <darksydephil> what the hell? 

[15:07] <darksydephil> a new platformer character 
[15:07] <darksydephil> oh look, banjo kazooie!

[15:13] <darksydephil> lol 

[15:13] <darksydephil> observer looked intersting 

[15:13] <darksydephil> everything else looks like a mobile game lol 

[15:14] <darksydephil> okay, so observer, thats it, everythign else looked like shit 

[15:15] <darksydephil> remember folks, Bioware is showing Anthem during this conference so its probably the 
big closer

[15:20] <darksydephil> The Lord of the Onion Rings: One Serving to Fill Them all 
[15:20] <darksydephil> oooh yummy 

[15:20] <darksydephil> WHAT? LOWER THE VOLUME DUMMY! 

[15:21] <darksydephil> it looks more cartoony 

[15:21] <darksydephil> seems like a toned down graphic style and FAR more annoying dialogue lol 
[15:22] <darksydephil> what the fuck, SO MUCH DIALOGUE 
[15:24] <darksydephil> i took a piss lol 
[15:24] <darksydephil> ok back 

[15:25] <darksydephil> it just seemse more streamlined a bit, new enemies, and tons of annoying dialogue lol 
[15:25] <darksydephil> oh fuck MORE TALKING 

[15:26] <darksydephil> I always wondered what Seth Killian did after Sony 

[15:27] <darksydephil> people got bored of Ori 1 within one session, soooo i doubt ill be playing thi sgame lol 
[15:28] <darksydephil> Owl Apocalypse! 

[15:28] <darksydephil> yeah thats a skip lol 

[15:31] <darksydephil> Phil Spencer is a good presenter btw, i give this guy props, he's engaging 
[15:31] <darksydephil> games you've already beaten! 

[15:34] <darksydephil> "now i'll bring out a crap co-op team of youtubers and twitch streamers to ruin the 
presentation of this new ip!" 

[15:35] <darksydephil> it's anthem, as i said, they promised this yesterday 

[15:37] <darksydephil> the dumb ignorant MAN did something stupid, now the woman has to clean up his mess 

[15:38] <darksydephil> open world flying is neat 

[15:39] <darksydephil> i like the maneuverability, its like Iron Man 

[15:39] <darksydephil> i wonder if different mechs are completely different playstyles 

[15:40] <darksydephil> this is supposed to be simulated voice chat fyi, not in game dialogue 

[15:41] <darksydephil> WAR MACHINE BITCH! 

[15:42] <darksydephil> so they went the Destiny route, shameless cash in but the gameplay looks solid/fun 

[15:42] <darksydephil> at least its not a fucking generic fps 

[15:44] <darksydephil> well that was incredibly underwhelming lol 

[15:44] <darksydephil> no, i lied, im not streaming my reactions Kappa

[19:00] <darksydephil> lovid? lol 

[19:01] <darksydephil> dinner was great, i love pasta and with my sauce its perfect 

[19:02] <darksydephil> believe me, im playing with the pro controller from now on. fuck the joycon shit 

[19:02] <darksydephil> made for little kids and controls like a broken vehicle 

[19:04] <darksydephil> BTW every single ARMS video was claimed, just as i’d expected 

[19:08] <darksydephil> ok ill start seting up the stream in a sec 

[19:13] <darksydephil> had the wrong screen up lol 

[19:14] <darksydephil> no Popsicolo , remember, stopping the stream earlier to eat dinner was an awful idea, 
because i was dropping viewers when the stream was hot! Despite the fact nobody makes money on Twitch 
views lol 

[19:16] <darksydephil> Dead by Daylight is Tuesday, that'll be something different 

[19:17] <darksydephil> first im doing the real tutorial, then im trying hedlok again, then we'll se what time it s lol 




[19:17] <darksydephil> at least ill be using the pro controller this time 
[19:18] <darksydephil> ok just tweeted that we’re live 


-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20170617-01 ARMS 3RD.LOG 

[11:27] <darksydephil> hello all! 

[11:28] <darksydephil> stream should be going live shortly 

[11:29] <darksydephil> BeTheAllen did you ban Bobbi yesterday for 30 minutes??? 

[11:30] <darksydephil> someone claiming to be Bobbi tweeted me saying you did lol 

[11:31] <darksydephil> it could have been total bullshit 

[11:31] <darksydephil> some impersonator trying to stir shit up 

[11:31] <darksydephil> so ill ask the real bobbi when i see them 

[11:32] <darksydephil> im sure there are logs but i dont personally keep them 

[11:33] <darksydephil> oh wait, turns out nightbot keeps total logs 

[11:34] <darksydephil> and you were being a dick to bobbi.wtf 

[11:34] <darksydephil> seriously? right after i modded you 

[11:35] <darksydephil> according to teh logs bobbi was being teased by BeTheAllen because he became a mod 
and she doesn't like him. then later on she PMed deep drive saying she'd been banned 

[11:36] <darksydephil> well being a mod comes with an air of responsibility, meaning, you don’t fuck around 
with kicks or bans, you don't tease stream chatters, that stuff turns people off 

[11:37] <darksydephil> being that there's no hard evidence of anything I'm willing to let it go this time, but i 
can’t waste time with this shit. Look, I just wasted 10 minutes on it when I could have been streaming 
[11:37] <darksydephil> hotsauceistoohot you've trolled before, i banned you MYSELF before so i think you 
should shut up lol 

[11:38] <darksydephil> BTW we're quickly approaching 5 million total views and 35k follows on the channel, 
pretty sweet 

[11:40] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:40] <darksydephil> stream starting up now 

[11:42] <darksydephil> someone bought this switch for me off of Amazon 
[11:42] <darksydephil> took about a week for them to stock and ship it 

[11:43] <darksydephil> yeah the Switch game lineup is a horrid joke, did you see the pick they put out yesterday 

as E3 ended...its like, no good games at all besides Splatoon 2 and Mario, all shit 

[11:44] <darksydephil> you're talking about games in development with no release dates lolol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> im talking about REAL GAMES coming out in 2017. the lineup is a joke 

[11:45] <darksydephil> yeah look at all the AMAZING third party support, it's 2 games lol 

[11:46] <darksydephil> CressTheAngel both are niche games and won't draw any mainstream attention 

[11:50] <darksydephil> ok back, got drinks, now setting up my laptop 

[11:52] <darksydephil> LOL i can hear the music screaming out of my headphones next to me 

[11:54] <darksydephil> it doesn’t work like that forwardarro , the pledges don't go through until July 1st unless 

it's a new pledge over the course of June, so no way to tell as of yet 

[11:55] <darksydephil> pokken will probably be sick, the only thing tha tsucks about it on wii u is the graphics 
and that will be improved for sure 

[11:56] <darksydephil> i did nich but haven't had a chance to read it yet 
[11:56] <darksydephil> ok prestream time!

or do regarding me. i have my own positive stuff to focus on and that’s all i care about 

[12:30] <darksydephil> let the miserable drama queen people do their own thing and have their own horrid lives 
away from what i’m busy with 

[12:32] <darksydephil> so when i turn on my Switch, it automatically turns my TV on too. that’s crazy, no other 
console does that lol 

[12:33] <darksydephil> i dont think MITB was so bad, but people hated the outcomes of the big matches, which 
overall soured public opinion on the event 

[12:34] <darksydephil> you can’t have an insanely high level ladder match get won by the guy who very 
obviously did the least amount of work because he’s the worst guy in the match, and then expect the crowds to be 
happy 

[12:35] <darksydephil> i dont want to play injustice, honestly 

[12:35] <darksydephil> of all the games right now its the least appealing to me 

[12:35] <darksydephil> looking forward to dead by daylight tomorrow since its something new 

[12:40] <darksydephil> stream working for everyone? 

[12:41] <darksydephil> ok cool 

[12:41] <darksydephil> ill tweet that we;re live 

[12:44] <darksydephil> Vegas is amazing if you do it right and awful if you do it wrong lol 

[12:44] <darksydephil> tons of food, shopping, shows, touristy-shit to do and see. or you can just blow all of 

your money on gambling in a day 

[12:45] <darksydephil> arguably Blanka and Caminy are the worst characters in USF2 
[12:45] <darksydephil> with Gief right behind them but slightly better 
[12:45] <darksydephil> i played Blanka in SF2 and 4 

[12:46] <darksydephil> hawk would be pretty hard to play with these controls 

[12:46] <darksydephil> he has very tricky 360 throw setups that wont work with lag, and his reversal is a DP 
motion 

[12:47] <darksydephil> Gief clean loses to Blanka and pretty much anyone with good fireball zoning, even with 

all the tools they gave him, he’s able to be zoned effectively at top levels 

[12:50] <darksydephil> yup and the hori RAP joystick for like 135 

[12:51] <darksydephil> markymark52 yes, AND the joystick is also coming out lol

[11:19] <darksydephil> hello all 

[11:20] <darksydephil> probably not, Lawbreakers doesn't look very good, and they're selling it at a budget price 
because they know it looks bad lol 

[11:20] <darksydephil> twitch prime announcement is apparently in 40 minutes 
[11:21] <darksydephil> aw, no artwork for this game :( 






[11:21] <darksydephil> i dunno, the email they sent me was acting like its some HUGE news 

[11:22] <darksydephil> Spooky WuN right now i barely play PC so why on earth would a PC company sponsor 

me, lol 

[11:23] <darksydephil> wow less than 4k views to hit 5 million here on my twitch channel, and yesterday we 
topped 35k followers' 

[11:23] <darksydephil> i do mean we, because my success here is greatly in part to you guys 
[11:24] <darksydephil> minecraft is like, a game you play while you do something else 
[11:24] <darksydephil> like watch tv or talk with stream chat 
[11:24] <darksydephil> by the way 

[11:24] <darksydephil> anybody know what framerate this runs at on xbox one? 

[11:25] <darksydephil> im assuming 30 like friday the 13th did 
[11:25] <darksydephil> no, because google is shit 
[11:25] <darksydephil> its always unreliable on launch day 
[11:25] <darksydephil> and nobody talks about fps 

[11:26] <darksydephil> oh god, is that what the twitch prime announcement is? i hope not 

[11:28] <darksydephil> yeah, that stupid verwatch thing is going to be the twitch prime announcement..wow. 

that's incredibly lame 

[11:28] <darksydephil> let's hype up free loot from a game over a year old as a big deal through a mass email lol 
[11:29] <darksydephil> there is no mainstream demand for legendary lootboxes attached to a twitch prime 
membership, lol 

[11:30] <darksydephil> i already said, i can't play wwe anymore, all of my videos have been claimed or blocked 

due to the video clips and soundtrack 

[11:30] <darksydephil> um, i barely played wwe2kl7 at all 

[11:30] <darksydephil> i did career mode and one sim lol 

[11:31] <darksydephil> id have to mute all music, only way to do it 

[11:32] <darksydephil> it has nothing to do with income, the vids are mostly getting muted or blocked 
[11:32] <darksydephil> so it HAS to have music muted 

[11:33] <darksydephil> considering they did away with the story campaigns in WWE, theres no much to do in 
them anyway, i have no desire at all to play career mode again after how boring it was, AGAIN, last year 
[11:33] <darksydephil> i have zero plans for another twitch and chill stream at the moment, i just did 2 of them 
back to back 

[11:34] <darksydephil> stream is working? 

[11:34] <darksydephil> of course there isn't any sound, its he xbox one dashboard which is silent 

[11:37] <darksydephil> ok brb, gonna get drinks and such 

[11:42] <darksydephil> wow, my laptop refuses to work with me today lol 

[11:43] <darksydephil> dude, send me the money for a new laptop 

[11:43] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:44] <darksydephil> welcome Kodakcam 

[11:44] <darksydephil> finishing setting up here 

[11:44] <darksydephil> what on earth 

[11:44] <darksydephil> i didnt time him out 

[11:44] <darksydephil> holy fuck my stream chat is crazy delayed 

[11:45] <darksydephil> wow i need to restart my laptop guys 

[11:45] <darksydephil> brb 

[11:56] <darksydephil> wow in all of their wisdom, microsoft made it so you can’t remove an account from xbox 
one. i see no way to remove Leanna's old account 
[11:57] <darksydephil> ok i found it 

[11:57] <darksydephil> its hidden in a settings menu unrelated to the accounts login, you know, genius!

[19:27] <darksydephil> ive never played Siren Blood Curse, so if you watched TIHYDP, it either was 
completely fabricated or it wasnt me at all lol 
[21:32] <darksydephil> hey charizard 

[21:32] <darksydephil> just because you're a sub isn’t a license to be a fucking douchebag constantly in chat 

[21:32] <darksydephil> so either cut it out or say goodbye 

[21:32] <darksydephil> ive had enough of your shit 

[21:33] <darksydephil> yeah, goodbye 

[21:33] <darksydephil> dickhead 

[21:33] <darksydephil> ive been watching the guy for weeks, he literally just constantly insults me 
[21:33] <darksydephil> so he can go fuck himself 
[21:33] <darksydephil> and keep his money 
[21:34] <darksydephil> okay goodnight everyone 

[21:40] <darksydephil> i unbanned him, but if he does it again, it'll be permanent 
[21:40] <darksydephil> he's been acting like a complete asshole for weeks 

[22:39] <darksydephil> you apparently come back with a new name because you're a complete idiot 
[22:39] <darksydephil> i should just reban you at this point lol

giving out false copyright strikes against playthroughs, then be my guest lol

[19:37] <darksydephil> 6th_Moral i recommend you watch the prestream from today, as i explain the entire 
situation, bottom line is we’re all waiting on more info from Atlus before we can proceed with anything from 
them

non-announcement just like teh NES classic considering you can play all those games, for free, right now lol 
[12:18] <darksydephil> star fox 2 was an unfinished game running on the same shoddy graphics engine as star 
fox 1. whatever they put out claiming to be 2 isn’t, its just what they did with it now and it’ll look awful lol 
[12:21] <darksydephil> jackwhite202 as i've said many times in the last few days, July is looking booked, 
between finishind read dead, dark souls ii SOTFS, playing fighters here and there and danganronpa 2 PLUS 
maybe crash 3 and my taking time off, theres zero time for a long ass JRPG 

[12:23] <darksydephil> no news BeholderChil only be YT JUST submitted the counter noficiations on Saturday, 
took them 2 days to process and atlus has 14 BUSINESS days to respond 

[12:25] <darksydephil> xthewrath93x i dunno? im just flat out ignoring everything and playing games, which is 
all im here to do to begin with, only time i've addressed stuff is chat getting out of hand the last few days but 
thats it 

[12:25] <darksydephil> im not aware of any bs drama going on because ignore it all and thats a good thing 
[12:26] <darksydephil> yeah, it does nobody any good to follow what these idiots say and do, it just creates more 
drama

[12:38] <darksydephil> hate to break it to my critics, but my streams are still very much about gameplay and not 
constant shilling, if you haven't noticed, just more interactive now, so to say im "worse than the rest of twitch" 
just makes you look like a fucking jackass lol 

[12:39] <darksydephil> CressTheAngel its getting better but still not there yet. im thinking danganronpa 2 
resumes tomorrow just to be on the safe side 

[12:40] <darksydephil> its a reputation based on slander and jealousy ThaBeardedBlarg and one i very much 
didn’t create nor perpetuate, so not much i could do about it 
[12:41] <darksydephil> nope 

[12:41] <darksydephil> its about ignoring the brainless sheep who constantly beat the dead horse and moving 
forward positively 





[12:41] <darksydephil> and thats what im doing 

[12:41] <darksydephil> maybe you should disable the emails that you chose to manually enable yourself? LOL 
you blame me for that?

[22:15] <darksydephil> Eriquw the thing is that USF2 is really Super Turbo, an over 20 year old game. I doubt 
anybody really cares if I did tutorials for it lol 
[22:19] <darksydephil> fuck 

[22:19] <darksydephil> if you missed tekken 3-6 you missed generations of shit lol 
[22:19] <darksydephil> so many new things int he game now

[12:24] <darksydephil> live in a sec 

[12:27] <darksydephil> I guarantee there won't be any news from Atlus, they'll just let the counter notifications 

expire and then the strike will get removed 

[12:27] <darksydephil> so theres no point in asking daily about it

[12:26] <darksydephil> well it's as ive said, if you're watching thi splaythrough and dont want to be spoiled, the 
ONLY way you can do that is to not read stream chat, i’d think those watching this game for the first time would 
probably prefer to watch on youtube to avoid the spoiler element 

[12:26] <darksydephil> yeah, the question is, will anyone cheer/sub/tip when they get no shout out for it. nobody 






did the first session besides 1 person 

[12:27] <darksydephil> im doing this as today's main stream to make up fo rthe multiple missed sessions but 
theres no way i can do this as main stream every day 

[12:30] <darksydephil> hotsauceistoohot that's correct, you're referencing something i put into effect 2 years ago. 
now not only has YT ad revenue plummeted but i have to worry about the streams as well, so a long playthrough 
like Danganronpa 2 is a HUUUGE risk fo rme right now. next time i do patrons choice i hate to say it but i might 
have to limit the kind of games that can be nominated 

[12:30] <darksydephil> yeah, no long JRPGs or weeb games, because they win every patrons choice and take too 
fucking long, and dont bring in any attention 

[12:32] <darksydephil> stream hasn’t started yet, i haven't said a word, "i can see why your girl left you" lol yes, 

what a logical human you are 

[12:33] <darksydephil> cool just added it qpzmwn 

[12:35] <darksydephil> ok is the stream working? 

[12:35] <darksydephil> ok ill tweet out that we’re live, then go grab some drinks

[13:21] <darksydephil> its fluctuating wildly lol

[13:31] <darksydephil> im almost ready to go live, got everything set up 

[13:31] <darksydephil> just need to cool the office down, its over 80 degrees in here 

[13:38] <darksydephil> LOL 

[13:39] <darksydephil> it's always a good sign when during your first contact with a real estate agent, they get 
your name completely wrong despite you just telling them what it is 

[13:40] <darksydephil> in my experience, real estate agents are super busy people who get pulled in a ton of 
directions and can't really focus, must be a super stressful job 

[13:41] <darksydephil> okay, im going to get the stream started so people will start filling in 
[13:42] <darksydephil> ! schedule 





[13:48] <darksydephil> when did i ever call Crash shitty? lol
