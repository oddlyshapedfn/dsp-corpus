[11:32:56] <darksydephil> so, just a few minutes 

[11:34:00] <darksydephil> okay then 

[11:34:04] <darksydephil> got the day started off right! lol 

[11:34:44] <darksydephil> good 

[11:35:10] <darksydephil> setting up now. but the office looks so empty without the Christmas lights 
dspAngrydsp 

[11:35:45] <darksydephil> my tree is staying up for a long while lol 

[11:35:50] <darksydephil> i put it up late so its staying up at least for January 

[11:36:05] <darksydephil> okay, starting off right again! lol 

[11:45:31] <darksydephil> by the way, we are still at 387 subs, pretty sweet 

[11:47:33] <darksydephil> okay final remix, then we’l start 

[16:32:57] <darksydephil> yeah bigboydumper i recommend you try a different browser if your stream keeps 
freezing 


-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180101-02 PUBG 13TH.LOG 

[19:36:02] <darksydephil> im right here 

[19:42:32] <darksydephil> finishing up with the MGS2 vids now 
[19:42:38] <darksydephil> then the stream will begin 

[19:43:04] <darksydephil> I disputed 2 of the claims agianst the MGS2 vids, that way, if they get denied there's 
no way my channel can get a big negative effect from it. so we’ll see what happens 
[19:50:13] <darksydephil> okay, got all the vids settled 
[19:50:16] <darksydephil> now we can start! 

[19:53:23] <darksydephil> zero viewers 

[19:53:24] <darksydephil> lol 

[19:53:26] <darksydephil> you are all ghosts 

[19:54:23] <darksydephil> i keep getting gifted subs to other streamers, lol 

[19:55:34] <darksydephil> nobody told me where anything was, but a couple people explained some controls be 
the game literally does not do so, they expect you to play the separate tutorial missions again, whcih i again 
didn't do 

[19:55:41] <darksydephil> and some easter eggs were revealed 

[19:56:32] <darksydephil> i now set the cheer threshhold to 25 bits on my desktop 

[19:56:39] <darksydephil> if it doesn't work this time, i guess maybe i have to do it when the steram is off or 
something 

[19:57:06] <darksydephil> BigBoyDumper i get ya, and i should say thanks as you did help me understsand the 
controls earlier 

[19:58:32] <darksydephil> okay i think i know what i did wrong 
[19:58:36] <darksydephil> there were two save buttons 

[19:58:41] <darksydephil> i must have clicked the lower instead of hte upper one 
[19:58:45] <darksydephil> so the 25 bit limit should work now 
[19:59:45] <darksydephil> okay last song, then we'll get started 

[19:59:53] <darksydephil> the final vid of my disappointing countdown is 16 minutes so yeah 
[20:00:00] <darksydephil> dont want to wait long, let me tweet that we’re live 
[20:03:09] <darksydephil> OH NO I STOPPED IT! 

[20:23:16] <darksydephil> look at this driving hahahah 
[20:23:22] <darksydephil> i was SURE to include this clip 

[20:23:28] <darksydephil> since this happened like 100 times during the playthrough

money 

[19:48:22] <darksydephil> i dont hate the game at all 

[19:48:27] <darksydephil> i hate how it performs on xbox one for sure 

[19:48:33] <darksydephil> but hte core idea and mechanics are sound 

[19:49:28] <darksydephil> it has both bcbiker but they both also run like shit, choppy as hell

[11:29:11] <darksydephil> its been over a week now

[19:56:29] <darksydephil> no 2nd stream tonight 

[20:24:07] <darksydephil> wassap. no stream tonight, busy editing my game of hte year awards 
-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180106-01 FORTNITE BR 3RD.LOG 

[11:28:48] <darksydephil> HiddenBaiken are you going to behave today or are mods going ot have to ban you 
again for being a douchebag to people who are being positive? 

[11:28:57] <darksydephil> because frankly im getting tired of i 
[11:29:03] <darksydephil> it 
[11:29:08] <darksydephil> okay 

[11:31:53] <darksydephil> no, Hidden Baiken was harassing people for being supportive. Like for cheering 
and/or asking fo rpeople to contribute 

[11:32:12] <darksydephil> and thats not acceptable, if people want to be positive and contribute or promote 
contributions that's none of your business 

[11:32:30] <darksydephil> we dont need people being counterproductive in here 

[11:32:52] <darksydephil> pretty good, had a nice convo with the GF 

[11:32:57] <darksydephil> now about to start the stream 

[11:40:16] <darksydephil> who is that kitty? lol 

[11:40:21] <darksydephil> thats an awesome emote 

[11:40:51] <darksydephil> by the way, i submitted a new emote 

[11:41:03] <darksydephil> Pops made one where i look like snake for MGS3 this week, hope it gets approved 
fast 

[11:44:54] <darksydephil> so we’re back down to 426 subs today 

[11:45:03] <darksydephil> hopefully we can keep hitting new milestones, we got up to 429 last night 
[11:45:27] <darksydephil> that'd be nice gamemaster2003isdead 

[11:46:11] <darksydephil> my honest fear is that we'll hit 450 and then people will just be like "well we hit the 
goal, no more needed!" and then i drop to like 300 by the end of the month, that would not be good 
[11:47:38] <darksydephil> well every month i will increase it a bit if we hit it, that's the point, ongoing growth 
[11:48:06] <darksydephil> 1000 subs would be damn nuts and amazing, i really hope the channel blow sup this 
year 

[11:48:22] <darksydephil> kozatof i dont add people anywhere lol 
[15:02:01] <darksydephil> Isubcount

[19:43:10] <darksydephil> i knoe nothing of discord at all

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180107-01 MGS3 REDEMPTION 2ND.LOG 

[11:18:09] <darksydephil> nope 

[11:18:26] <darksydephil> its the weekend, twitch is on holiday of course dspEw 






[11:18:58] <darksydephil> wow we’re up to 444 subs 

[11:19:04] <darksydephil> thats incredibly close to the goal! 

[11:19:07] <darksydephil> and then we push to 500 

[11:23:49] <darksydephil> Nich, when i announced the goal we weren't even at 400 yet lol 
[11:23:53] <darksydephil> the growth has been quite huge 

[11:24:06] <darksydephil> and honestly im very skeptical we’ll keep the subs this high unless i keep moving the 
goalpost and adding goals 

[11:24:10] <darksydephil> hence the 500 subs goal etc 
[11:24:39] <darksydephil> okay folks 
[11:24:41] <darksydephil> im disabling livepet 

[11:24:49] <darksydephil> so wave goodbye to the ugly guy with pink hair lol 
[11:25:28] <darksydephil> okay should be gone now on refresh lol 

[11:25:42] <darksydephil> yeah since people are complaining it makes the stream lag, good riddance, its an 
interesting experimen tthough 

[11:27:02] <darksydephil> i would do a special celebratory event for sure, some kind of marathon and maybe 
something added, or maybe a week of marathons 

[11:27:15] <darksydephil> how about a 10 anniversary event where i replay classic games peopel loved etc 
[11:27:22] <darksydephil> i could beat heavy rain in one stream 
[11:28:30] <darksydephil> sorry my remixes disappeared 
[11:28:33] <darksydephil> had to reload them 

[11:34:57] <darksydephil> no, they are just retards, nobody believes that anymore lol 
[11:35:06] <darksydephil> that "girl's" story has been destroyed and torn apart 

[11:35:25] <darksydephil> she's not even saying that she was here in december anymore and that the pic i took 
was some OTHER girl she knows now lol 

[11:35:33] <darksydephil> everyone knows its complete bullshit at this point 

[11:35:54] <darksydephil> which isn't surprising because, as ive said, it was based on 0% facts 

[11:39:06] <darksydephil> hauntslashl999 do you have a point to posting nonsense? 

[11:39:34] <darksydephil> banned moron 

[11:41:21] <darksydephil> darn we dropped back to 443 subs 

[11:41:29] <darksydephil> record is 444 though

[11:28:33] <darksydephil> hello everyone! 

[11:31:53] <darksydephil> okay etting up now 
[11:31:55] <darksydephil> setting 
[11:31:57] <darksydephil> live shortly! 

[11:32:30] <darksydephil> good, lots of positivity about today 
[11:33:25] <darksydephil> by th way 

[11:33:35] <darksydephil> why doesn't windows know how to spell positivity 
[11:33:43] <darksydephil> like thats the spelling, but it always says its wrong 

[11:35:21] <darksydephil> ReviewTechUSA isn’t a bad guy, he just cannot stay out of drama because that's what 
fuels his popularity at this point, he has to talk shit and stay in other people's business or else nobody is going to 
watch him 

[11:35:26] <darksydephil> and i want nothing to do with that 

[11:35:48] <darksydephil> i dont want a guy one day praising me and the next up in my personal shit for no 
reason 

[11:37:40] <darksydephil> who's hype for....this dspSNake 
[11:37:42] <darksydephil> fuck 




[11:37:44] <darksydephil> dspSnake 

[11:40:29] <darksydephil> theres no way to "bust your nuts" lifting weights, they won’t explode, but they will 
get pulled inside you if you go ta hernia 

[11:41:07] <darksydephil> no, and if it happened, you need surgery right away 
[11:41:10] <darksydephil> no lie 
[11:41:13] <darksydephil> my dad had it 

[11:41:22] <darksydephil> if not it'll just get worse and cause permanent damage 

[11:42:47] <darksydephil> your testicle pulled inside your groin, where it doesn't belong 

[11:42:59] <darksydephil> it needs to be surgically pulled back into place and your groin repaired 

[11:43:21 ] <darksydephil> tortion is something that happens slowly, not suddenly 

[11:43:30] <darksydephil> its unlikely here 

[11:43:46] <darksydephil> battleduck? lol 

[11:44:06] <darksydephil> why do people change their names, i get so confused lol 

[11:44:10] <darksydephil> oh okay, sup karlis

[19:41:18] <darksydephil> okay here we go! 

[19:52:06] <darksydephil> up to 466 subs! New record! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180111-01 DEMON’S SOULS FINAL 2ND.LOG 

[11:21:36] <darksydephil> they're also porting all teh multiplatform games from last gen that couldn’t run on the 
WiiU 

[11:21:40] <darksydephil> it's pretty funny lol 
[11:28:12] <darksydephil> oh come on 

[11:28:22] <darksydephil> dark souls on the switch runs at 30fps, runs at 60 on ps4/xbox one 
[11:28:23] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:28:28] <darksydephil> the switch can't run games for shit 

[11:30:07] <darksydephil> Critical_For_D4ys this has been like this for years, nothing new 
[11:30:13] <darksydephil> people just need to be careful on the internet 

[11:33:28] <darksydephil> Dark Souls will look exactly like it did on PS3/Xbox 360 on the Switch, then run at 

60fps and look amazing on PS4/Xbox One lol 

[11:33:34] <darksydephil> and people will pay the same price for it 

[11:33:37] <darksydephil> because they are stupid 

[11:37:02] <darksydephil> im going to residentevilbeating 

[11:37:05] <darksydephil> probably this Sunday 

[11:37:09] <darksydephil> when i finally have time 

[11:37:28] <darksydephil> why would i try the taco bell stackers, its just meat and cheese in a shitty tortilla 

stacked stupidly, not something actually new at all 

[11:43:09] <darksydephil> we dropped by ONE SUBNOOOO 

[11:43:10] <darksydephil> lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180111-02 FORTNITE BR 4TH.LOG 

[19:35:53] <darksydephil> hello 

[19:36:01] <darksydephil> so it looks like we're playing fornite 
[19:36:33] <darksydephil> honestly, no lol 







[19:42:56] <darksydephil> okay stream is live! 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180112-01 DISSIDIA FF NT BETA 1ST.LOG 

[11:28:03] <darksydephil> oh no 

[11:28:08] <darksydephil> we dropped ONE SUB overnight again! 

[11:28:15] <darksydephil> the horror! dspSurpriseddsp 
[11:29:17] <darksydephil> i dunno anything about this game 

[11:29:30] <darksydephil> i was looking at the character roster and its pretty robust, tons of characters from the 
vast majority of FF games 

[11:29:55] <darksydephil> Ace from FF-0 is also in it 

[11:30:07] <darksydephil> and yeah MMO characters too, plus villains from the series 

[11:30:30] <darksydephil> although they covered Cloud of Darknesses' boobs, which is a HUGE mistake 

[11:30:31] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:30:59] <darksydephil> by the way 

[11:31:04] <darksydephil> is this 30 or 60fps on PS4? 

[11:31:11] <darksydephil> im assuming 30 
[11:32:13] <darksydephil> damn 

[11:32:23] <darksydephil> should i record or broadcast at 30 or 60? lol 

[11:34:20] <darksydephil> Nich2440 i did take feedback, but at the same time, final fantasy dissidia isn't even in 
the broadcast list here on twitch lol 

[11:35:02] <darksydephil> unless someone can find the game listed, i can't broadcast as playing this game 
[11:35:06] <darksydephil> and thats a rarity for twitch these days 
[11:35:55] <darksydephil> thanks 

[11:36:01] <darksydephil> ill swap over once i actually start playing the game 

[11:36:35] <darksydephil> apparently this was an arcade game in Japan that did so well, they adapted it to a 
console game 

[11:36:37] <darksydephil> that's a rarity 

[11:37:05] <darksydephil> it also means the controls are probably pretty simplified 

[11:39:41] <darksydephil> yes thanks Kekon, i guess that's the closest thing, this is technically Dissidia NT but 
they didnt add it 

[11:40:32] <darksydephil> also my NEW Wii to HDMI adapter is arriving today, the one you recommended 
Kekon 

[11:40:49] <darksydephil> so hopefully this works or else i dunno what to do to play Sunshine, i doubt 
emulation will work as it'll probably slow down my computer enough that i can't stream/capture 
[11:41:29] <darksydephil> well it was 4x as expensive as the shitty ones i got lol 
[11:41:35] <darksydephil> so yeah you'd think it works 

[11:43:20] <darksydephil> KushiYakitori the game isn't listed, so im doing IRL and then im gonna switch it over 
to the previous game in the series i guess 

[11:43:40] <darksydephil> im doing the tutorial first, i have no idea wtf im doing in this 
[11:43:43] <darksydephil> never even seen gameplay yet 

[11:45:05] <darksydephil> we need to make a game of all the badass characters from my playthroughs over the 
years 

[11:45:34] <darksydephil> Boone, the ore that killed me a million times in Shadow of Mordor, etc 

[11:45:44] <darksydephil> all duking it out 

[11:46:05] <darksydephil> okay last song, then prestream 

[11:46:36] <darksydephil> yeah, there are no new remixes sadly 

[11:46:41] <darksydephil> not like there isn't material to work with 

[12:11:40] <darksydephil> !subcount

[19:52:16] <darksydephil> shit 

[19:52:27] <darksydephil> i was gonna start talking but i forgot to tweet out the stream 
[19:52:35] <darksydephil> give me a sec lol 

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180113-01 DBFZ BETA 3RD.LOG 

[11:37:19] <darksydephil> hello all 
[11:37:24] <darksydephil> about to get started! 

[11:44:29] <darksydephil> ugh okay 

[11:44:41] <darksydephil> im really tired of babysitting drama hounds, thats all im gonna say 

[11:44:46] <darksydephil> it wastes my fucking time 

[11:44:47] <darksydephil> anyway 

[11:44:50] <darksydephil> NOW i will start the stream 

[11:47:15] <darksydephil> who? 

[11:47:31] <darksydephil> what? when? lol 

[11:47:43] <darksydephil> sounds like someone is an idiot, i haven't talked about pc gaming in...ages? i cant 
even remember 

[11:48:17] <darksydephil> "in a video a couple of years ago" LOL 
[11:48:40] <darksydephil> you're right, it doesn’t 

[11:48:54] <darksydephil> "in a video years ago" i said that Minecraft was a shitty game for morons, then i 
played it and understood why people liked it 

[11:49:19] <darksydephil> life isn't black and white and things said on the internet aren't absolute, if you were a 
mature adult, you'd know that 

[11:50:37] <darksydephil> thesecretlifeofdsp are you really the person that made that video? 

[11:50:44] <darksydephil> or are you just someone who uses that name 
[11:50:51] <darksydephil> be honest 

[11:51:49] <darksydephil> SlickYouTube again, no mature adult would watch a video "from years ago" and 
just assume it still holds true today. That's just ignorant. 

[11:52:27] <darksydephil> tutorial is great, ill play it, but i want a damn training mode 
[11:52:35] <darksydephil> how am i supposed to learn the new fighters with no training... 

[11:52:59] <darksydephil> you are correct Slick YouTube some people are just so stupid, you can't help them 
[11:53:55] <darksydephil> thesecretlifeofdsp sure, you can change the thumbnail, because it's one thing to make 
a video about me, i dont care, but to make a clickbait thumbnail with my ex girlfriend who had next to nothing to 
do with me or my content in 2017, and then an "escort" that is 100% fabricated, it just proves you're a hack, so 
remove that thumbnail or else just admit you're in it to insult me and not for the sake of "making a funny vid" 

[11:56:31] <darksydephil> i dont want to whisper you, I want that thumbnail removed immediately, and i'm 
saying it in public, because you need to be called out on it. you know it was wrong and you did it for clickbait to 
get views, and that proves you're a hack. 

[12:00:32] <darksydephil> thesecretlifeofdsp Calling you a hack isn't name calling, it's a fact. A thumbnail 
should be representative of the content of the video. A video supposedly highlighting the worst gaming moments 
of 2017 has nothing to do with my ex girlfriend or a pretend escort. That is what a hack does to create clickbait 
and get views. So if you had ANY self respect, you'd drop everything you're doing now and remove the 
thumbnail, then replace it when you have a chance. Or else my point is made and proven 
[12:02:03] <darksydephil> BionichOOt and that has nothing to do with the actual name of the video. It's 100% 
clickbait 

[12:02:36] <darksydephil> I am discussing this with you, right now, in public 
[12:02:40] <darksydephil> so why do you keep repeating that? 

[12:02:44] <darksydephil> how about a response? 

[12:03:26] <darksydephil> exactly Stinkinburrows 

[12:03:39] <darksydephil> he’ll make a 3 hour video slandering me, but god forbid he respond to an honest 




question in my own stream chat 
[12:05:27] <darksydephil> okay prestream starts now 
[12:05:45] <darksydephil> coward 
[12:05:46] <darksydephil> goodbye

-#DARKSYDEPHIL 20180114-01 DEMON’S SOULS FINAL 3RD (DBFZ BETA DOWN).LOG 

[11:30:20] <darksydephil> wassap guys 
[11:30:59] <darksydephil> going live now! 

[11:31:27] <darksydephil> raisinbreadistasty there is no risk regarding the forums, no info has been leaked, if 
anyone says otherwise, they are blatantly full fo shit 
[11:31:56] <darksydephil> wait, the beta is totally down now?! 

[11:34:28] <darksydephil> congrats! Mention doxxers and get a perm chat ban 

[11:41:25] <darksydephil> BeTheLewd and any other mods, if there is blatant spam about any doxxing, its a 
perm ban 

[11:41:39] <darksydephil> laying down the law now, its just those dumbfucks trying to cause drama 

[11:43:45] <darksydephil> by the way, it was already revealed that the doxxer is a mentally ill guy who has done 

this before to other communities, and he does it all the time, and does whatever he wants, he’s doxxed groups of 

women and kids too, just for giggles, people notified law enforcement and of course, they did nothing 

[11:44:11] <darksydephil> so the best course of action is to, as ive already said, protect yourself and not put your 

info on the net publicly 

[11:45:02] <darksydephil> VeissVorra : you go back as far as you can and delete what you can 

[11:45:30] <darksydephil> thats all you can really do. ive said it a million times, social media like facebook etc 

is an awful fucking idea 

[11:45:55] <darksydephil> you can't just willy nilly post up random geotagged photos of you in personal/private 
places and info and expect to be safe forever 

[11:46:23] <darksydephil> if it doesn't work, then it's demons souls today 
[11:46:25] <darksydephil> not much can be done 

[11:47:33] <darksydephil> nah theres no point in playing more dissidia yet, they didnt go into the next phase 

[11:47:42] <darksydephil> that starts tomorrow, its the otehr half of the cast unlocked 

[11:51:21] <darksydephil> ill give you a hint, if MHW has a 40-50 hour "story" it means it sucks lol 





[11:51:27] <darksydephil> its probably a repetitive grindfest 
[15:28:04] <darksydephil> im about to return! 

[17:42:50] <darksydephil> its over BigBoyDumper lol 

[17:42:55] <darksydephil> and no second stream today, you missed it! 

[21:35:17] <darksydephil> [schedule 
[21:35:22] <darksydephil> there you go

[11:25:50] <darksydephil> !subcount 

[11:25:59] <darksydephil> we were up to 487, now down to 479 overnight 

[11:26:15] <darksydephil> hope we can get those back 

[11:26:23] <darksydephil> we were super damn close to the goal! 

[11:26:28] <darksydephil> and yeah, i bet a bunch were 

[11:26:34] <darksydephil> lots of people gifted in December because of the discount 
[11:27:34] <darksydephil> i think Gohan, Goku and Cell 
[11:28:19] <darksydephil> Goku's assist seems great 

[11:28:27] <darksydephil> blows through a ton of shit and covers your ass while you attack 

[11:28:34] <darksydephil> i have to learn how to use the assists properly 

[11:29:11] <darksydephil> Nappa is probably great with knowledge of his Saibaman setups 

[11:29:16] <darksydephil> but without training mode, impossible to figure that out 

[11:47:39] <darksydephil> okay starting up in a sec here 

[11:48:36] <darksydephil> nice, so the stream should be fun then

[19:35:28] <darksydephil> well i had a headache but i think its actually going away now 
[19:35:44] <darksydephil> just gotta add these dbz vids to playlist and then we can start tonights stream 
[19:41:59] <darksydephil> it's like I said, nothing I do would stop anything, they can easily just start it back up 
again with a new demand, and fuck all, this time i dont give a shit 
[19:43:00] <darksydephil> yes new emote is live! 

[19:43:13] <darksydephil> thanks to Nick for that one 
[19:47:24] <darksydephil> you and me both 

[22:57:07] <darksydephil> straightcashhomie29 : tipping or Patreon give me the most overall income, but bits I 
get 100% of what you cheer, but of course you pay more for hte bits than what i get for them 
[22:57:09] <darksydephil> its confusing lol 

[22:57:24] <darksydephil> basically cheering, tipping and patreon are the best, subbing is still good too but that 
one is the least profitable for me 

[00:23:23] <darksydephil> got your email and responded infinite

[22:45:57] <darksydephil> multiplayer had far more potential, but i dont remember what i played

[11:43:27] <darksydephil> so my stuff is doing better than ever and im getting fucked because youtube can't do 
their job, as usual 







[11:43:59] <darksydephil> im 4 followers away from 49k here on twitch actually 

[11:44:35] <darksydephil> no, followers = youtube subs, they’re completely pointless, which is nothing is base 
don them on twitch, but youtube bases several important criteria on subs there, because they're fucking morons lol 
[11:45:20] <darksydephil> kid buu seems ridiculous after seeing others play with him, i didnt know wtf i was 
doing with him at first

[19:41:24] <darksydephil> i was better at 2 actually, i didnt like 3 
[19:43:14] <darksydephil> no, 3 is pretty bad competitively lol 

[19:43:27] <darksydephil> it only has about 5 characters who are good in a tournament, the rest are all garbage 
[19:43:45] <darksydephil> and its only be Vism is broken as hell, it doens't work as the devs intended at all 
[19:44:03] <darksydephil> third strike is great at top levels, but sadly 3 characters are piss easy to play and way 
overpowered 

[19:46:03] <darksydephil> well my xbox one is malfunctioning, i have to hard reboot it now 
[19:46:54] <darksydephil> okay that problem fixed, now my batteries are low lol 
[19:52:45] <darksydephil> the good news is, lots of people are resubbing 
[19:52:47] <darksydephil> that is a great sign 
[19:52:52] <darksydephil> no, its be they are resubs 

[19:53:04] <darksydephil> also, you only get the chat notice when they click the share button 

[19:53:11] <darksydephil> they could have subbed hours ago and just now clicked it 

[19:53:13] <darksydephil> when i went online 

[19:54:53] <darksydephil> um the dbfz beta ends in 1 hour 

[19:54:57] <darksydephil> so you wont be on it for long lol 

[19:55:15] <darksydephil> pwnage lOl i have no idea, i wouldn’t think so 

[19:55:44] <darksydephil> there's no more beta Derich, the game releases on friday of next week 

[19:55:56] <darksydephil> thank god for this beta though, the online play is far better for it now

[11:25:58] <darksydephil> be then its going to TANK once the Christmas event hits one month, there were like 

40 new subs that day lol 

[11:27:24] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:27:37] <darksydephil> people are saying its like PUBG/fortnite but with MGS mechanics 
[11:29:39] <darksydephil> so does this run at 60fps or 30? 

[11:29:49] <darksydephil> i think im going to record at 30 anyway, i dont care lol 
[11:41:56] <darksydephil> yrdy 
[11:41:58] <darksydephil> wtf 





[11:41:59] <darksydephil> test

[11:43:08] <darksydephil> im not planning on cooping this beta lol. it doesn't deserve that 

[11:43:58] <darksydephil> okay final song, then we start 

[11:45:34] <darksydephil> residentevilbeating : was gonna do it Wednesday, didn't ahve time, was gonna do it 
this Sunday, but now a new patron Q&A vid request came in, so now i probably cant lol 

[11:46:24] <darksydephil> yeah Viking got banned, for supposed DDOS attacks, which makes no sense, he was 
never even accused of DDOS attacking anybody at all, it was DOXXing 
[11:46:30] <darksydephil> so it really makes no sense 

[11:46:44] <darksydephil> but none of us can really do anything about it anyway 

[11:46:55] <darksydephil> i may need to look for more 1st stream mods soon 

[11:47:08] <darksydephil> yeah, raccoon is MIA, no idea where he went 

[11:47:28] <darksydephil> i dont even think we have a mod today 

[11:47:34] <darksydephil> so yeah, i might nee dto start looking for new ones 

[11:47:42] <darksydephil> ah! sup Popsicolo 

[11:47:59] <darksydephil> hello Doubledlris , welcome

[15:06:45] <darksydephil> ok coming back in a sec, just gonna piss first lol 
[16:24:36] <darksydephil> um, sherrie isn’t a mod 
[16:24:41] <darksydephil> how exactly did she ban you? 

[16:25:11] <darksydephil> LOL are you arguing in my chat about something on twitter? 

[16:25:17] <darksydephil> that's not what this chat is for 

[16:25:49] <darksydephil> you cannot be banned by someone who isn’t a mod 

[16:25:53] <darksydephil> that's actually impossible 

[16:26:14] <darksydephil> it sounds like we've got a case of confusion on our hands 
[16:26:29] <darksydephil> dspShock 
[16:27:27] <darksydephil> stream chat is serious bidness 
[16:31:46] <darksydephil> im pretty sure it auto installed 

[16:32:00] <darksydephil> when i turned on my ps4 it said a fortnite update was installed 

[16:32:22] <darksydephil> what i do is, i take everyone's name that isn't kozatof, put them into a hat, and choose 

one 

[16:33:13] <darksydephil> oh, those people pay me thousands of dollars to get in 
[16:33:35] <darksydephil> im trolling you btw

[19:35:23] <darksydephil> back down to 505 subs now dspShock 

[19:39:14] <darksydephil> i think im gonna need more daytime mods now too lol 

[19:39:34] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:40:02] <darksydephil> JanneDaArcl35 i thi nk we have blueblur, bethe, and pops. That's the only consistent 
ones and they're not always here, some people drop in time to time but its not steady 
[19:40:11] <darksydephil> and now Viking is banned 

[19:40:43] <darksydephil> Sgt_Woomy dinner was soup and salad. Italian salad w/light dressing and chicken 
noodle soup, low sodium 

[19:40:57] <darksydephil> gottisttotl he can but people will undoubtedly report him and get him rebanned so no 
point 

[19:41:15] <darksydephil> if you can JanneDaArcl35 but no pressure 
[19:41:25] <darksydephil> a diet? nope lol 




[19:41:41] <darksydephil> thats what i eat half the time, i make it a point ot have non-meat meals at least 2-3 
times a week 

[19:41:50] <darksydephil> well, i guess theres a bit of chicken in the soups but you know what i mean 

[19:42:46] <darksydephil> Anony hasn’t been around in weeks/a month or more 

[19:42:51] <darksydephil> no idea why, ive seen him post on the forums 

[19:44:09] <darksydephil> Markmccauley : a thin spaghetti, it's easy to slurp 

[19:45:51] <darksydephil> slap em with the flag 

[19:45:53] <darksydephil> for max impact 

[19:46:00] <darksydephil> it's legal, you didn’t touch them 

[19:46:44] <darksydephil> suplex only football 

[19:46:51] <darksydephil> you ain't down til you arch that back son 

[19:47:32] <darksydephil> the best part is, the detractors have been trying to have me "get rid" of Vidar for 
months be they think he's a cash cow who pays me hundreds of dollars a month or more. 

[19:47:37] <darksydephil> it couldn’t be further from the truth 
[19:47:43] <darksydephil> he stopped doing that like 5 months ago 
[19:47:48] <darksydephil> he just liked the streams 

[19:49:30] <darksydephil> "Phil won’t ever denounce Vidar because he's Phil's cash cow." Then I denounced 
him for going to Kiwifarms, so they changed it to "Phil will never outright say that Vidar shouldn’t have 
DOXXed and threatened us!" So then the whole issue got resolved, they still had to fuck with him because 
they’re insanely convinced that he's like 75% of my income. Some people are just that stupid. 

[19:50:41] <darksydephil> I said the twitter was a catfish account the dayit started posting weird shit about me. 
Why it took some people over a month to figure it out only proves how slow they are. 

[19:50:54] <darksydephil> it's not even the first time this has happened lol 

[19:51:12] <darksydephil> Back on Twitch years ago, they posed as Angela Capri, a "porn star" 

[19:51:21] <darksydephil> and that was fake too, which I pointed out ot everyone

[11:30:23] <darksydephil> i dunno how this is gonna go though lol 

[11:31:00] <darksydephil> i will probably have to turn off voices by default then, i think you can do that and 
then manually enable them 

[11:31:34] <darksydephil> yeah well thats waht i mean 

[11:34:01] <darksydephil> how can i interact if people are just running around saying the N word? 

[11:34:22] <darksydephil> i think what ill do is explore a bit, commentate, and then maybe unmute a few people 
to talk with 

[11:35:33] <darksydephil> okay im ready to get started...oh boy 

[11:39:20] <darksydephil> so im listening to these remixes through headphones today for the first time ever

[11:42:23] <darksydephil> and i dont have that much money to waste on a worthless peripheral 

[11:43:14] <darksydephil> no becuase PSVR is a PS4 exclusive and this is PC only 

[11:43:23] <darksydephil> so you need an incredibly overpriced VR headset to play it lol

[19:37:07] <darksydephil> hello everyone 

[19:41:08] <darksydephil> Nich it's a decent idea but i dont think either of those games would be interesting, 
skyrim i did a 100% playthrough of, and oblivion is quite boring, as seen by my first run that never continued 
[19:42:25] <darksydephil> i was thinking february would be patrons choice, if we hit a subs goal it happens, then 
$5 patrons nominate/vote for the playthrough 

[19:42:46] <darksydephil> we haven't done patrons choice in ages, and im doing sunshine starting in feb, will 
finish in march, so the new game can start in april 

[19:42:53] <darksydephil> that gives patrons all of march to nominate/vote 
[19:43:50] <darksydephil> there aren't many 
[19:43:53] <darksydephil> check the actual release schedule 
[19:43:57] <darksydephil> april is empty 

[19:44:22] <darksydephil> you're watching the VRChat of skyrim 

[19:45:06] <darksydephil> if a game is scheduled as "Q2" and it's only about 2 months until the second quarter, 
it means those games aren't coming out in Q2 lol 
[19:47:24] <darksydephil> resetting top cheer now 
[19:50:25] <darksydephil> lol this is hilarious 

[19:50:40] <darksydephil> just got a year end mortgage statement for my condo in CT 

[19:51:08] <darksydephil> current amount owed to pay off the mortgage: $ 103k. Current value of condo: $65k. 
HMMMM dspHmm 

[19:51:13] <darksydephil> i wonder why i can't sell the condo! 

[19:51:48] <darksydephil> i can't rent or lease it. i dont live in CT to deal with any problems and be a landlord, 

and there are no reliable companies in that area of CT because it's a shithole 

[19:52:09] <darksydephil> i can't 

[19:52:13] <darksydephil> its a facility, id kill people

[11:29:53] <darksydephil> this is the 1 month anniversary of the holiday gaming marathon 

[11:30:28] <darksydephil> yeah it could be, i remember getting like 30-40 new subs during that marathon

going so far

awesome 

[11:22:10] <darksydephil> my current PC chair is old, falling apart and was crap to begin with 
[11:22:27] <darksydephil> i bought it when it was on extreme sale lol 

[11:23:24] <darksydephil> i dont think that fixes disintegrating armpads and a hydraulic lift system that barely 
works and falls constantly lol 

[11:25:29] <darksydephil> yeah today and tomorrow you guys can finally use the batphil emotes haha 
[11:27:20] <darksydephil> yeah like, just uploading videos im fine, but gaming in this chair is anightmare 
[11:27:24] <darksydephil> its so uncomfortable 

[11:27:40] <darksydephil> in fact thats how OPSeat found out about me, they randomly tuned in when i was 
playing VRChat and complained that my back hurt be my chair sucked 
[11:27:46] <darksydephil> so they offered me sponsorship, pretty sweet 
[11:28:29] <darksydephil> yeah i will 

[11:28:41] <darksydephil> this one has two cushions, one for the head/neck and one for lumbar support

one, we need a new one 

[11:23:34] <darksydephil> feb is decently busy. UFC3, SOTC remake, DW9, secret of mana remake, my 
sunshien playthrough and my girl will be moving in. plus continuing with PUBG and constant DBFZ online 
play, and DIssisia too still going 

[11:23:51] <darksydephil> yeah i have no idea, you may be right 

[11:26:32] <darksydephil> thats correct

[11:26:59] <darksydephil> one of the few n64 games i owned and didnt rent, i loved it 

[11:27:58] <darksydephil> im thinking im going to replay at least one classic GTA game this summer, plus 

bloodborne and heavy rain, that will kind of be my 10 year anniversary event 

[11:28:31] <darksydephil> all 3 of my original GTA playthroughs are ruined. GTA3, VC and SA are all 
demolisehd now 

[11:28:39] <darksydephil> yeah but i cant use music anymore

[12:42:41] <darksydephil> kind of impossible to play a fighting game when thats the case 

[12:43:40] <darksydephil> cool if all goes well i'll be here too. ill prob sleep for a bit more, then have some soup, 
then take a shower and hopefully feel better 

[12:44:06] <darksydephil> yeah im sure peopel are shocked im not here, i rarely miss a stream these days 
[17:53:26] <darksydephil> yeah chat is now screwed up 

[17:53:55] <darksydephil> you can't remove top tier by clicking on it anymore, and you can't even see who 
you're hosting on the chat, they updated it and messed it up. i can't even click anywehre to see whose thread im 
hosting, i have to look in the hosting box now 
[17:54:09] <darksydephil> stream not thread 

[17:58:38] <darksydephil> yeah you can also type /reset which is what ive been doing 
[18:00:26] <darksydephil> night stream will start at the usual time

[19:12:07] <darksydephil> wassap. anyone here? 

[19:19:37] <darksydephil> lol why do people use this schedule so much 
[19:19:46] <darksydephil> i keep saying my twitter is the most up to date 
[19:20:26] <darksydephil> im much better now 
[19:20:35] <darksydephil> fever gone, ate so i feel energized 

[19:22:24] <darksydephil> yeah i get the sniffles and throat/sinus issues from time to time but i rarely get a fever 
to the point where i get the chills and such 

[19:22:30] <darksydephil> so this was rare, but i shook it fast thankfully 

[19:22:47] <darksydephil> you don’t need twitter to check my twitter, you can just go to twitter.com/darksydephil 

[19:22:54] <darksydephil> oops 

[19:22:57] <darksydephil> i forgot my own twitter 

[19:23:02] <darksydephil> its twitter.com/theycalhnedsp lol 

[19:23:55] <darksydephil> not a detractor ata 11 

[19:24:02] <darksydephil> looks like a fan made that before i ever had a real twitter 
[19:24:04] <darksydephil> then i made a real one 

[19:30:27] <darksydephil> the story of monster hunter world: you fucking kill monsters 
[19:31:16] <darksydephil> what? 

[19:31:30] <darksydephil> who on earth told you autism is a symptom of being an outsider??? 

[19:31:41] <darksydephil> that's ridiculous 

[19:33:05] <darksydephil> a mental condition, present from early childhood, characterized by difficulty in 
communicating and forming relationships with other people and in using language and abstract concepts. 
[19:33:28] <darksydephil> it's a mental condition, ft’s considered a disorder, and it's not because you're an 
outsider, being an outsider would probably be a result of it 
[19:33:45] <darksydephil> yeah i didnt update the stupid stream title 
[19:33:48] <darksydephil> i just did

in a lighting game you need to practice with them first 

[18:36:44] <darksydephil> so practicing 3-4 characters in training mode, then going online, it would take like 
almost 2 hours before i’d even get started 

[18:37:11] <darksydephil> nobody really, ive only played the game once seriously on friday and haven't even 

been in training mode yet. ive been sick

[11:00:21] <darksydephil> wassap 
[11:01:01] <darksydephil> im finally alive! 

[11:02:51] <darksydephil> yeah that was some serious bullshit 
[11:02:53] <darksydephil> but im back! 

[11:03:05] <darksydephil> headache gone, just a tiny bit of head pressure left, and no fever at all 

[11:04:19] <darksydephil> Critical_For_D4ys : sometimes the human body can pick up microscopic organisms, 

otherwise called bacteria or viruses, than can negatively effect the operations of a healthy system. It takes time 

for a body's immune system to fight and eliminate said organisms, hence resulting in symptoms of illness 

[11:05:57] <darksydephil> okay, so 2 days left this month, hopefully we can do a big month-end push and make 

this by far the best streaming month ever 

[11:06:04] <darksydephil> sucks i wasn't here for 3 days but im ready to go full force now 

[11:06:34] <darksydephil> thank goodness i didnt commit to Monster Hunter, can you imagine what a disaster 

that would have been lol 

[11:07:44] <darksydephil> um, no offense, but if you think using shampoo got me sick, you are just silly 
[11:08:01] <darksydephil> and i used the shampoo on Wednesday, i didnt release the video the same exact day i 
used it 

[11:08:17] <darksydephil> okay, you are not silly, you're being nuts 
[11:08:19] <darksydephil> relax lol 

[11:09:15] <darksydephil> a ton of people in the USA have been sick in the last 2 weeks, chances are it's that 
and not shampoo magically having a side effect to give me a fever and headache or 3 days, people will believe 
anything lol 

[11:09:48] <darksydephil> it was more likely that escorts showed up and poisoned me in my sleep than the 
Selsun Blue is the culprit of my illness 

[11:12:15] <darksydephil> yeah its the final 2 days to pledge to my Patreon and get in on the Indie games event, 

or questions for Ask the King next month, or a private Q&A vid 

[11:12:34] <darksydephil> it was way lower than that jack 

[11:12:44] <darksydephil> like the low 530s, we boosted it beak up last night 

[11:13:09] <darksydephil> thats what happens when im sick for 3 days 

[11:14:40] <darksydephil> jackwhite202 we already hit the 550 goal, its a lock 

[11:14:51] <darksydephil> and Critical_For_D4ys yes i read out your cheers during streams and am grateful, 
thanks 

[11:15:05] <darksydephil> i absolutely am 

[11:15:16] <darksydephil> actually pretty close to 100%, just a bit of head stuffyness id say 
[11:15:19] <darksydephil> but no pain or fever 

[11:17:36] <darksydephil> btw for those not aware, new Tier 2 and 3 sub emotes are live 





[11:17:39] <darksydephil> and they look like this 
[11:17:45] <darksydephil> dspTier2 dspTier3 

[11:18:19] <darksydephil> someone made new sub badges for chat, but i dunno if i want to use them only be 
people are now so used to these 

[11:19:23] <darksydephil> his farts glow like rainbows now? 

[11:19:49] <darksydephil> nah youd better not 

[11:19:55] <darksydephil> i dont care abotu the show but others might 
[11:20:20] <darksydephil> the new sub badges are still crowns 
[11:20:25] <darksydephil> just newer looking ones 
[11:20:29] <darksydephil> they are far more 3d looking 

[11:21:09] <darksydephil> i like them but like i said, im afraid people will react poorly being that we've all been 
building toward getting these for over a year 
[11:21:52] <darksydephil> excellent 

[11:22:50] <darksydephil> well considering how shit The Last Guardian was, they need something to make them 

look pertinent again 

[11:23:11] <darksydephil> lol 

[11:23:14] <darksydephil> well it wasn’t good 

[11:23:21 ] <darksydephil> you can make excuses all you want but the game wasn’t fully functional 

[11:23:40] <darksydephil> you can't hide behind "but it was meant to be an annoying creature!" and pretend like 

it was still a good game 

[11:24:17] <darksydephil> okay i guess ill start up the stream 

[11:25:04] <darksydephil> i just realized the reason i feel a little groggy is be i took a sleeping pill for the first 
time in like 3 years lol 

[11:28:25] <darksydephil> an amazing observaction 

[11:28:29] <darksydephil> observation even 

[11:29:49] <darksydephil> well hopefully more mods will show up 

[11:30:45] <darksydephil> BeTheLewd is back 

[11:31:17] <darksydephil> thanks BattleDuck9000 ! 

[11:39:40] <darksydephil> okay last song, then we get started 
[12:08:26] <darksydephil> tier 2 is dspTier2 
[12:08:55] <darksydephil> tier 3 is dspTier3 

[16:59:47] <darksydephil> so far the online play of this game is pathetic... 

[16:59:49] <darksydephil> and thats a damn shame 

[16:59:57] <darksydephil> it's a good game, the fundamentals are all there 

[17:00:27] <darksydephil> no, MvCI is bad because its a bad game, this is bad be the connecitons are bad and 
the servers drop 

[17:00:37] <darksydephil> this game is actually good, thats why its so sad 

[17:01:21] <darksydephil> i have no idea if anything will improve, i dunno how ARCSYSTEMS works as ive 
neve rplayed a game of theirs before 

[17:01:26] <darksydephil> but this...is jsut really really sad IMO 
[17:01:57] <darksydephil> i played 3 people since 4pm LOL 
[17:02:01] <darksydephil> thats 3 matches in an hour 

[17:02:36] <darksydephil> what really pisses me off is that frame data they put on the matches that's completely 
wrong 

[17:02:56] <darksydephil> yes, 2-3 frames but hte matches rae freezing and stuttering LOL yeah okay 
[17:03:21] <darksydephil> no not FPS, the frame delay 

[17:03:35] <darksydephil> its supposed to be measuring how much delay a match has but its completely wrong 
most of the time 

[17:04:05] <darksydephil> ok folks im gonna upload and eat dinner, ssee you for the story tonight hopefully!

[19:00:25] <darksydephil> there's nobody here, you mental midget 




[19:33:06] <darksydephil> wassap 

[19:33:18] <darksydephil> state of the union is over so we can start 

[19:33:56] <darksydephil> i find it hilarious that while i was live streaming and complaining about the online 
play of DBFZ, Bandai Namco live tweeted an apology for how bad it ccurrently is lol 
[19:34:14] <darksydephil> makes all the morons in stream chat bite their tongues now 

[19:35:49] <darksydephil> "but we can't see the lag" has to be the stupidest justification for believing there isn’t 
lag in an online game in 2018. like, really, you have that few brain cells? lol 

[19:38:10] <darksydephil> "the actual maker of the game admits online play sucks? NO it's YOUR FAULT Phil! 
There's totally no way that full time fighting game streamers would kiss the game's ass for money!" 

[19:38:47] <darksydephil> yo 

[19:38:56] <darksydephil> looking forward to almost finishing up this story 
[19:39:01] <darksydephil> just want it over with lol 
[19:39:31] <darksydephil> im good, and i had chicken sausages for dinner 
[19:39:39] <darksydephil> um do you really want a 4-emote of my giant head? 

[19:39:42] <darksydephil> i didnt think so lol 

[19:40:24] <darksydephil> but we SHOULD invade major FGC streams with my Goku emotes just to troll the 
fuck out of the tournaments 

[19:40:27] <darksydephil> that would be pretty dope lol 

[19:41:25] <darksydephil> Nich2440 what backlash? FGC stream monsters are idiots 
[20:51:11] <darksydephil> Tier 2 dspTier2

[10:59:50] <darksydephil> was that guy seriously in here talking to himself for several hours? 

[11:05:00] <darksydephil> so apparently lobbies in this game are horrid 
[11:05:04] <darksydephil> and everyone is complaining about it 

[11:05:28] <darksydephil> so if they dont work, back to sitting around waiting all day for ranked matches i guess 
[11:08:07] <darksydephil> yeah thank god im FINALLY almost done with the story 
[11:08:11] <darksydephil> one more session and that should be it 

[11:09:47] <darksydephil> yeah its obvious they didnt know what to do with the story mode at all sadly, unlike 

Netherrealm who usually does a great job mixing it up between story scenes and combat 

[11:09:52] <darksydephil> im good Critical_For_D4ys thanks for asking 

[11:11:35] <darksydephil> wassap

[11:14:49] <darksydephil> i hope Kekon is around to day to help us test lobbies, he said he was interested in 
playing 

[11:19:11] <darksydephil> wow, my stream audience is exactly the same as my youtube audience, 60% from the 
USA, 40% international 

[11:19:46] <darksydephil> and WOW a whopping 20% of my stream views come from people just browsing 
around twitch, thats huge 

[11:19:54] <darksydephil> and a total difference from youtube where its like, 2% 

[11:20:56] <darksydephil> my #2 viewership comes from the UK and #3 is Canada 

[11:24:45] <darksydephil> the pillow is far better, that other guy looks like he could just be high off his ass 
[11:25:00] <darksydephil> yeah i have an extra emote spot now, so we have to figure out what we want 
[11:27:48] <darksydephil> my Selsun Blue DSP Tries It video has over 10k views and I haven't made $5 on it 
yet, LOL 

[11:27:57] <darksydephil> fuck youtube, its so dead and not worth it to make content for anymore 
[11:28:11] <darksydephil> i didn’t even PAY for the shampoo yet with the video 
[11:32:28] <darksydephil> im sorry to hear that Xboxl_is_garbage
