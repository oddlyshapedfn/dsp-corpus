Well, all of the KOF games take a while to load, but probably the best one so
far would have to be 97. But I actually liked 96 better (it had Geese Howard,
Mr. Big and Krauser, come on!)

Well if everything relies on personal skill, tell me a time you've ever seen
Ken go from the universal overhead into a 20-hit combo like Ibuki did! He
can't. The game is unbalanced, pure and simple. If Ken had that combo, I would
use it, but he doesn't, so I'm at a disadvantage against characters who can do
a crouching short into an infinite combo like Ibuki.

There will always be people who complain about others being "cheap" or "cheesy"
because they are better than them. If people complain about me throwing too
much, I just say "complain again and I'll really start throwing you." If they
do complain again, I just make every move I do a throw. They usually leave, but
they learned their lesson. Whiners are losers, especially when you can tech hit
out of throws these days.

uh, yeah that's it. Or maybe not. All I know is I won't play Ibuki because
she's so overpowered it's not funny.

found it last year in the bargain bin at my local Circuit City for $10. The
game is great, but there are only 2 problems.
1. The game is EXTREMELY hard, even on the easiest setting.
2. The controls aren't exactly top-notch. It seems like whenever you need them
to work, they are unresponsive.
But the music and graphics rock! IMO the best traslation of SSF2T.

>even other basic S-combos like ryu's- low forward,
>2-in-1 into shinkuhadoken aren't coming out for me.

Well I've noticed this too. The low forward will hit, the shinkuu-hadoken will
come out, but all of a sudden the opponent is no longer stunned and can block.
It seems rediculous to me. 2-in-1's with normal moves still work though. For
example, do a normal fireball after the low forward and it will connect, but a
super fireball won't. Don't ask me why, it seems like they have made super
moves useless in this game. And fireballs? Uh. They do so little damage it's
disgraceful. I don't even bother with them, unless I'm playing Sagat and am
trying to keep cheap ass Vega away. So I give a mighty 2-shotokans down to
Alpha 3. Bah. It sucks.

You think Ken's ending is stupid? Try Zangief's! He goes to Shadaloo
headquarters where he meets with E. Honda, who says he saw some machine inside.
They team up and go inside the Shadaloo base to find a big psycho power
machine, which revives Bison. So to destroy the machine Zangief SPDs E.Honda
into it a lot of times. It blows up. They rejoice and brag that their
combination of strength and weight is unstoppable. Wow. Funny.

Well that seems funny to me, since I beat him the first time I played against
him with Zangief, and the damage and difficulty at my arcade is set at the
default, so don't say it's because the game's on easy. Just keep Air Pressing
into a few low jabs over and over again. If he tries to use the ugly-looking
super Psycho Crusher crap, just block it and do a FAB when he teleports back in
front of you (he has to). Bam. You've won. Big deal. I had more trouble with
Guy than with Bison.

Ok I just spent about 2 hours playing with the shotokan-type characters (ryu,
ken, sagat, akuma, dan). At first they seemed to suck bigtime. Fireballs do
rediculously little damage, dragon-punches have pitifully bad priority, and
super moves are almost pointless. But I experimented and found how to use them
effectively. So here's what I came up with:

Sagat
Best mode: V-ism
Why: In V-ism Sagat has alternate punches by holding forward or backward and
pressing strong or fierce. The strong is ok for trading ground hits and just
plain looks nice. But I like the new fierce punch. It is a standing uppercut
that is soooooo great, ESPECIALLY against Vega, because it has such great
priority over everything else. It will knock him out of the air almost every
time! Vega players beware, your weakness has been found! And if you activate
the pseudo-custom combo (I like the fastest one the best, activated with Fierce
and Roundhouse) he can do repeated tiger knees to juggle the opponent into the
corner, then keep using tiger blows to rack up massive hits and damage. Or just
stay away and throw random high/low tiger shots, and his shadows will throw
extra ones that confuse the opponent.

Ryu
Best mode: X-ism
Why: X-ism Ryu can do massive damage with just a few hits. His jumping in
roundhouse->crouching forward->fireball combo does over 25% damage. His super
vacuum-fireball does decent damage if blocked or if it connects (which it
constantly does surprisingly, it goes through almost every other move in the
game!). And in this mode the Shoryuken has higher priority than the others.
Finally, by holding forward and pressing fierce, Ryu can do a 2-hit elbow
thrust that not only looks nice but is fast and can take many an opponent by
surprise.

Ken
Best mode: ????
Why: Well, where do I begin? Since the shinryuken is now useless because the
vacuum has been removed, A-ism sucks. X-ism isn't much better either, though it
is a little because Ken does a little bit more damage with his moves. But his
shoryu-reppa just sucks cuz it's slow and predictable, and even if the first
hit connects, most of the time the opponent can block the rest for some strange
reason. So probably it's a tie between X and V-ism. I can't comment on V-ism
combos though cuz i didn't use Ken in that mode much.

Akuma
Best mode: A-ism
Why: Diversity. Plain and simple. Akuma's hurricane kick/uppercut juggles are
great, and it's nice to have super air and ground fireballs too (though like i
said they hardly do any damage). And his shoryu-reppa is better than Ken's cuz
it's just a little more damaging. Besides, X-ism totally sucks cuz his super is
the raging demon, which is hard to get to connect.

Dan
Best mode: A-ism
Why: His super fireball is cool but does as little damage as ever. However, his
level 3 super combo (can't recall the name, but the one where he stands still
and does all those kicks/punches/uppercut at the end) suprisingly has a vacuum
now and is a great move to use. Plus it is very damaging to boot! Also try his
level 3 super taunt which turns every move he does into a taunt! Coolness
redefined.

Whew, anyways those are my opinions. I hope I helped out somebody that at first
thought these guys sucked bigtime. SF Forever!!!!!!!!!!!!

> hey tell me anyone how the heck blanka turns out to be hondas
>counter character?

It's simple: Capcom fucked up Honda in the final version of A3. Honda sucks
against almost any character now because he's so slow and has low priority. And
Blanka would be a great character if he wasn't slow and didn't jump so damn
high! And why haven't Blanka or Honda gotten any new moves? (except for the
stupid supers which nobody cares about anyway) I mean we've waited years to
play them again and they're still the same! And what's up with Blanka? They
should have kept his supers from EX2 instead of taking them away and giving him
that predictable vega-like ceiling jump super crap. I mean this is just
rediculous! Everybody ends up playing Vega or Zangief or some stupid shotokan
and the rest of the players go unused. So what if Capcom is gonna have a big A3
tourney in Japan, and America too? The tournament's only gonna consist of 5
characters! Capcom has lost it man.........

The midboss, 9th character boss and final boss are the same for Balrog, Juni,
Juli, and Bison. The midboss is Akuma, the 9th guy is Sagat, and the final boss
is Ryu. And when u beat the game with any of them u only get Bison's ending. Oh

Priority, priority, priority.........
sheesh
I can't believe you guys are actually arguing about if it exists or not. Here
is a simple example that proves it does, short and sweet:

Remember Chun-Li in Alpha 2? Her jumping short and jumping forward would snuff
out anybody else's jumping moves even if they were poorly timed, making her
queen of the air wars. And how about that crouching forward that was quicker
than the Flash and snuffed all normal ground moves? How can you say it didn't
have priority???

Finally, the most obvious example: Strider Hiryu in MvsC. ANY move that he has
involving his sword will go through anybody's else's providing they don't have
super armor (i.e. Cap's super charging star).

So there :oP

Gief is AWESOME in no-ism. He actually stands a chance against Vega now! In
fact, here's what i've found Gief can use to counter Vega:
Any jumping attack: standing jab (early)
Any standing attack: well timed standing or crouching fierce punch (since Gief
pulls back before he punches, press fp when Vega sticks out his claw, and Gief
will get a counter hit)
Any crouching attack: repeated crouching jabs, or a well timed crouching FP
Wall jumps: use a standing jab if Vega stays away in midair, or the punch
spinning lariat if he stays directly overhead
That jump off the wall where Vega flies straight at you (sorry I was never one
for move names): a well-timed jab flaming hand
That pesky ground roll: really the only thing Gief has trouble with. Sometimes
a well-placed jab will stop it, otherwise block it and then counter his next
move

So there you are, everything you need to make no-ism Gief a powerhouse against
Vega. Tell me whatcha think. Down with that fag!

Well I've seen the coolest one yet:

A guy I know was using Venom and Wolverine, and pulled a gang-bang super at the
end of the match (my name for the new MvsC double team move). First he called
out Colossus, hit CapCom with him to the point of death, and then did a
Weapon-X. The motion also made Venom do his Venom Web, and Wolverine and Venom
did this super-awesome 20+ hit super slow-mo combo that I've never seen after
that ever again! I call it the Venom-X. It has to be seen to believed.

Ok let's get something straight: these secret characters are not, CANNOT be
from the EX series. Why? Because Arika owns them, not Capcom! Arika bought a
license to use SF characters in their 3D fighting games, but Capcom does not
own the rights to any original EX characters. And I really doubt that Capcom
will go through the trouble of buying a license to use Arika characters when
they can use Dee Jay, Fei Long, T.Hawk, Guile (but it doesn't look like he's
one of 'em dammit), and Evil Ryu. I just can't believe that Shadaloo Bison
isn't going to be selectable! I wanted to use that cheesy Shadaloo-psycho
crusher too.

Anyways, it seems likely that the secret characters will also not be from SF3.
Why? Because Capcom wouldn't go through the trouble of redrawing the sprites
from that practically-new game, and the existing sprites can't be converted
because of the amazingly high frame rate of the CPS3 engine (alpha 3 STILL runs
on a CPS2). So give up on SF3 characters too.

Sorry to burst your bubbles guys. But the truth must be told. You really
shouldn't be getting your hopes up about these characters that couldn't
possibly be in the game anyway. And so what if there are 5 new characters? We
all know that Vega is still going to be way overpowered over everybody else and
a bitch to beat no matter who you play. And another thing: this is the Alpha
series, not the original SF2 series. My point? Any returning characters will
have piss-poor damage. The massive 1/4 of your energy damage from just tapping
the edge of Fei Long's flaming dragon kick will probably be reduced to a mere
sliver of hurt. And I'm also sure that Capcom will fuck with the priority of
the moves too. Let's be honest, do you really think that any anti-air move that
a character does will out-priorize a Vega wall-drop from directly overhead? I
didn't think so.

Ok, the damage is done. Now that I've crushed all your hopes and dreams, you
can move on to something bigger and better to look forward to than the PSX
Alpha 3. Maybe SF4?

Ok guys, here we go again with the Saturn/PSX wars. I understand that a lot of
gamers are willing to settle for the butchered PSX versions of the two versus
games, and if you are one of these gamers, let me just settle the whole darned
issue by saying this: if you played the Saturn versions, you would shit the
wall. They're really that much better, and you would NEVER want to play, or
even come within a one-mile radius, of the PSX versions ever again. I'm
guessing that those that have settled for these versions have never played the
Saturn versions. But it's perfectly understandable why the PSX came out on top
in America: Sega of America. They killed every Sega product so far, and they'll
continue to do it over and over by refusing to release the good games and
giving us the shit that's left at the bottom of the barrel.

Okays guys, enough. This rivalry has gone on long enough. How about this: let's
discuss the players who are really good and why they are good. Why is Valle so
good? Probably because he spends his whole life in the arcade at Sunnyvale or
at tournaments. I'd really love to know how these guys support themselves. Do
they have jobs? Do they go to college? Did they ever even graduate from high
school? Who knows. I honestly want an answer. I just can't believe that these
guys, east or west coast (okay so most of them are west coast) are just BETTER
than everybody else. There has to be a reason. And I'm betting that that reason
is because these guys have no life outside of a video arcade.
I'm not one to brag: I'm good at capcom games but I get beaten too. I think
that I can honestly say that I'm one of the best in southern Connecticut (along
with Tee Carter, we're longtime rivals), but I'm sorry to say that I'm only a
high school student who has more important things on his mind that traveling
the country to go to tournaments where I can have the priviledge to play guys
who's life is Street Fighter 24-7. Obviously I'll get schooled and be ashamed
of my pitiful skills. But I'd rather go to a good college, get a good-paying
job, and raise a family than be a veritable Ryu, wandering from place to place
just to win tournaments to make enough money to live. Let's smarten up guys:
Street Fighter IS NOT a way of life like a lot of people make it out to be.
It's just a fun game that is meant to be played on the side, while things like
school, jobs, and family come first.

And by the way, I have played Valle once in KOF97 when I went to Sunnyvale a
few years ago. Of course he kicked my ass. He'd probably been playing the game
for a month before me (it was my first time playing). But it was pitiful that
he was soooo good in such a short time. I'm willing to bet he spent like the
whole entire week it came out in the arcade just to find out the most powerful
characters (can you say Benimaru?) and whoop all the competition from here to
oblivion like he did to me.

So once again, I'm sorry to bust all you guys balls, but wisen up. Street
Fighter is not some great big sports competition with a East coast-West coast
rivaly. It is only a game. And those like Valle who are supposedly SO good at
it that they are unbeatable are just sad little kids who haven't grown up yet.

And by the way, somebody tell Valle that I posted this, cuz I want a response
from him.

Nuff' said.

(By the way, I AM the undisputed champion of Tekken 3 on the East coast. If
anybody thinks otherwise, come down to old What's Your Game? Arcade in
Bridgeport on a Friday or Saturday night and I'll show you a thing or two. That
is if I'm working (that's right guys, I have a J-O-B!)

Okay, so maybe I'm making assumptions. But I didn't say that I was right in the
first place. That's why right at the beginning I asked for someone like Valle
to respond to see just why these guys are so good in the first place. I still
believe that these guys play the games a hell of a lot more than me and that's
why they're better. Then I get to go online and hear all about the "SF gods"
who are so good. And I think to myself "Hey, I could probably as good as them
if I had the time to spent on it. But I don't, and it's no big deal." And the
East Coast getting the games later than the West Coast is probably a buncha
bull, I agree. Of course I'm sure Valle beat me at KOF97 cuz I'd never played
the game before, and he had already mastered Benimaru. Man did that lighting
fist corner trap piss me off......
However, you have to agree that when the east coast NEVER gets games (I've
never seen a KOF98 machine, and the only place I've heard of it over here is at
Chinatown fair in NY), we can't exactly stand much of a chance.

Now YOU'RE making the assumptions. You're basically saying that I was wasting
my money by playing him because he would have beaten me no matter what the
circumstances (sounds like a classic case of Valle worhip to me!). Well I
woulda LOVED to see him beat my Ralf or Terry with somebody like Cheng......now
THAT woulda been frickin hilarious. I'm sorry, but I just do not believe that
somebody can be "naturally" good at games, or that the "force" is with him.
That's just a buncha crap. That case may be so in sports (some people are more
muscular, or just better athletically built than others, and so are naturally
better) but no way is it so in video games. I will never dunk on Jordan, but it
is possible for me to beat Valle at SF. That's because anybody can learn to
hone and refine their minds and reflexes. And now we're getting into philosophy
and I'm getting a headache......

I'm not making excuses. I'm just trying to understand why people worship these
guys, and why there's an East-West rivalry. It's really no big deal, just a
game.

If he did post, he'd probably just swear at me for callin him a little kid and
threaten my life.......a typical response to any threat. And this isn't a
childish tirade either, it's a legitimate argument. Like I already said, I
didn't know if I was right or not about it, I just wanted an answer from
somebody who knew these guys, or from the guys themselves. Thanks for actually
posting in response.

Not really. You obviously didn't realize that I was being sarcastic (then again
who can tell when you can't hear the person's voice? I'm pretty stupid ain't
I). Anyways, I am pretty good at Tekken 3, but I know I'm not the best. There's
always somebody out there who can beat you......and that's why neither Valle or
Choi or even Viscant (uh-oh, what have I started?) can be the undisputed US
champion of anything. After all, none of them have played me. So there!

(Just on the side, does anybody know if Valle works at Golfland, or used to?
Cuz when I went it looked like he worked there and at first I didn't recoginze
him. After about 7 consecutive ass whoopings it hit me though....)

Allow me to present a revolutionary idea into the board: why do people play
Alpha3? Allow me to explain. I hate the game. Why? It's too gimmicky for me.

Why the need for -isms? Because it's an attempt by Capcom to make the game seen
more interesting. It doesn't work. The game is still horribly slow to play, and
just plain boring. As always, some characters are rediculously overpowered in
the hands of skilled players. And now the people have finally realized the true

potential of the all-powerful V-ism combo. I knew this was coming. It's just a
repeat of the CC crazyness of A2. After people started decimating me when I

realized I couldn't stand up, and it was unavoidable when I was too close, I
hated the game. I mean, why????? WHY???? Why do we need these stupid "new combo
systems?" They are useless. The best Alpha in my opinion was A1. Yes, A1, the

forgotten one. Why? Capcom introduced chain combos. These took skill to execute
and added a whole new side to the game. But they were avoidable. To this day I
refuse to use Custom Combos in A2 and V-ism combos in A3. They are just utter

trash added to appease us for an otherwise boring game with nothing really new
to give us.
Sorry, I'd rather get my butt kicked with a punch-kick combo by Ken than by his
15 shadows.

Now allow me to name some games I like: the VS. series. Oh no, I've done it
now! Am I completely mad?????? Not really. Am I a scrub? Hardly. Then why do I

like these games with infinites and 60% plus damage and button-mashing? Because
it's FUN. Yes, I said FUN. Whoa, what a new concept. Fun is what video GAMES

are all about. The VS. games aren't like A3. Here's a typical A3 match:" Wow.
One guy is gonna use Rolento and use the Rolento pattern, and another guy's
gonna use Ken and use the Ken pattern, and they're gonna duke it out in super
slow-mo until one of them messes up and eats a 50% V-ism combo. Wow." Now

here's a typical MvsC match: Wow. One guy is gonna use Strider and Chun-Li and
use the typical patters, etc. But what about the helpers? A well-timed Colossus
will fuck up any pattern you have. You can roll out of almost anything and

effectively retaliate even if the opponent executes a combo correctly. So
there's always excitement and fun. Sure the game is horribly unbalanced....but
is it? Any character, if played effectively, can defeat any other character.
Can anybody tell me Hulk's 60% corner combo of doom? No? That's because I've
only gotten it to work once. How about Gief's zany teleport punch? Or a
well-timed super charging star totally eating up Strider's Oroborous? These are
once-in-a-lifetime things. You never know what's gonna happen when you play

MvsC cuz the game just has so many factors to consider. And sure you can argue
that there's infinites. Well here's what I say: SCREW THEM. Where I live nobody
knows them but me, so it doesn't really matter. We all get together weekly to
have a hell of a lot of fun playing an unpredictable game called
MvsC......rather than an utterly predictable, slow, and boring one named A3.

Stop playing A3 just because it's the "newer" game and play something quality
for a change.

Okay, so I over did it a little. Okay, a LOT. I was making assumptions that I
couldn't back up. It just gets a tad annoying when there's this whole East-West
coast rivalry thing that's so stupid to begin with, and then I have to read all
these arrogant bastards on the West coast saying they're just good,
period.......I'd like to apologize to Valle (tho he probably didn't read the
thread anyway) if it seems like I was making a personal attack on him. I
shouldn't have used his name, but been more general. I was just wondering if
these so called "pros" played a hell of a lot of SF to get that good, is all.
But I went overboard, and accused Valle of having no life and playing games
24/7. Oh well. We all have our bad days.

HOWEVER.........

I'm sorry guys but my belief that MvsC is more fun to play than A3 sticks.
That's right. I never said that MvsC had a better fighting engine, or that it
was a better game overall. I said that A3 is too slow (maybe my machine is set
really slow, or maybe I'm just used to the versus series, but it's just SLOW
around here) and that VCs are trash. And I still believe I'm right. If the game
was just A(Z) and X-ism, and a little faster, I might like it more. But I'm
sorry, this game is just too boring for me to play. I played it for a month
after it came out and soon realized that I could decimate any opponent with
No-ism Zangief. Then somebody actually figured out how to beat me, and I
switched to X-ism Dhalsim. After a week or two that got old and I picked
Rolento, then Karin, then Rose (who is highly underrated, if you ask
me).....then I even got desperate and played as the shotos....then the novelty
ran out. I'm just plain bored whenever I play that game. It's too highly
dependent on previously planned-out matches. And once I'd found out they ruined
the Alpha Counters.......well that was the last straw, so to speak.
MvsC is just more fun. It's more dependent on spur-of-the-moment thinking. Some
of you have argued that if you use a certain pattern with characters like
Wolverine, Chun-Li, or Strider, that you'll always win. Not so. In theory
you're right, but this is real life. People make mistakes. Controls mess up.
Shit happens. And it'll be that one second that you make a mistake that I'll
take control. And then you can kiss your beloved two tokens goodbye......
And as for infinites.......I already explained that nobody around here knows
how to use them but me, right? Well yeah the competition does mainly consist of
scrubs. But there are a few decent players. And why don't I use the infinites
to win every time? Because that just wouldn't be FUN. F-U-N. I'd rather have to
use three combos to defeat my opponent than one unescapable one. Because ya
see, video games are becoming a lot like professional sports. It used to be for
the love of the game. Now it's just to be "the big shot" who can beat
everybody. Well for those of you out there like that, I say SCREW YOU. We don't
need your kind around our machines. Some people just wanna have fun. Go play
baseball or something you losers. Use some skill for a change, learn how to
play the game, or go home.
Also there's a big difference between throwing and infinites.....namely, throws
are escapable, and throws don't kill you instantly. So there. Personally I love
throwing, and believe it or not I take a lot of shit about it. Maybe next time
a scrub complains about me throwing him, I'll use an infinite? Maybe then he'll
be happy.

So that's how I feel. This is my personal opinion. I never said any of this was
fact in the first place, just my belief that MvsC was more fun to play, and
therefore a better GAME overall, than A3. Because games are judged not by how
hard they are to play, or how much skill they take, but by how much fun you
have while playing them. And I knew that by going against popular opinion and
not conforming to what the common video gamer believes, I was gonna take a lot
of shit. And I did (13 posts of it actually). And that's okay, because nothing
that anybody says will ever change my opinion. Call me a scrub. Call me a
loser. Call me too lazy to play A3 every weekend and master all the characters.
Because you're right: I'd rather stay awake while playing MvsC.

You're just some freak that's.......
j/k.
But seriously, the animation of the Vs. games is some of the best ever. That's
another reason I think they're so fun to play. But as for Cody's backround
stage.....bland dude. The A3 backrounds pale in comparison to the A2 ones.

## https://groups.google.com/g/alt.games.sf2/c/RgjDTWTPhNY/m/3F9DplNDZ3QJ
Gee, I wonder why Capcom dished out the PSX version of A3 so quickly? Probably
because the arcade version was dying already and they wanted to save the game
with a few new characters and World Tour mode........

But that's okay, this game's not gimmicky according to you guys, right?

## https://groups.google.com/g/alt.games.sf2/c/RgjDTWTPhNY/m/dcokZ0RjtQsJ

Exactamente. But is that any excuse? I mean, if I make a game with three frames
of animation per character, and the home port comes out 2 hours after the
arcade version, is that a good thing? Compare the time for A2 and A3 to hit the
home versions. A significant difference. Skimping on the backrounds is NOT
good. It lowers the overall quality of the product.

Okay........I think you just killed you own arguement. So why is Blanka bein
comic relief a bad thing? Because you already had Dan, Sakura, and R.Mika. And


anybody who doesn't think E.Honda's "DOG PILE!" isn't utterly

characters isn't funny, it's annoying and disturbing.

Wow. He's not weak because he's slow? That's funny because everything you just

Guys, ya know, you really shouldn't complain about how bad a game
looks/plays/is going to be before you play it yourself. You should just wait
for it to be released first. So just stop being pessimistic about SF3:3i until
it's in the arcades, okay? Then we can all complain together about how bad it

1. Wait your turn
Put one to two quarters/tokens up at a time (depending on how big the machine
is) and wait your damn turn. Keep track of who's next so you don't get gypped
outta your turn, and a fight doesn't ensue concerning who's next to get their
ass whupped. Oh yeah, one more thing, don't steal other people's quarters!!!!

2. Who you callin a foo???
Don't swear at other people. E.G. "You piece of cheap $hit! How dare you use
that bull$hit on me you biotch!" You may not want to do that unless the person
is a close friend or you want to start a small riot. However, it is okay to
vent some frustration at the game. E.G. "Stupid piece of $hit! I pressed the
buttons! I moved the joystick! And I still lost?!??!!?!" It's preferable to say
something stupid or comical so that people don't think you're a mentalcase.
For example, the other day when I went to pick Colossus, and the damned game
gave me ARTHUR of all people, i went into a swearing frenzy that people simply
cracked up about.

3. I NEED PERSONAL SPACE!!!!!!
Don't rub up against players, grab their asses, etc. There was this one little
kid who always stuck his head between the two players so he could see the
screen......one time he knocked one of their arms and the guy lost. After a
swift elbow to the gut, the kid wised up.

4. ***VERY IMPORTANT***
LAY OFF THE NACHOS!
Yesterday there was someone who kept ripping out big ones, and let me tell ya,
it wasn't a pretty sight. Ya know, that's what BATHROOMS are for ya little
turd!

5. Don't gloat (too much)
If you beat that annoying guy with the 20-win winning streak, tease the shit
outta him. But it you're the one with the winning streak, there's no need to
make fun of your opponents after winning. It just makes you look like a
conceited asshole.

6. Wash those hands!
There's nothing worse that gettin skanky hands from a video game!

7. Hands off!
Don't hit your opponents buttons you cheatin bastard!

8. Look out below!
Don't put soda or food or anything on top of the game! If it falls, not only
will the game be broken (there goes thousands of dollars outta your pocket!),
but you'll have a soaking wet, sticky, and pissed off opponent ready to do a
shin-shoryuken combo on your ass in real life.

9. Avoid the -isms!
No, not the A3 isms. I mean racism, sexism, or ageism. If somebody is a
different race than you, or a girl, or older than the average gamer, it's OKAY!
Everybody is entitled to play a good game. And chances are if you make fun of
them for being different, you'll get your ass thrown out by a mob of angry
gamers.

10. Don't be a bore
Try not to pick the same characters EVERY time you play and use the exact same
strategies over and over. That just makes the game boring and repetitive and
people just tend to go home a lot quicker.

If that was true you wouldn't base your judgements on how long it takes to
learn a game, or how much skill it takes to master it.

Um....once again....
I've debated this before on this board about a month ago, and got flamed for
it. But I'm sorry, I stand in my beliefs. Does anybody know what the word
"game" means? Well here's the official definition according to Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary (for all you guys in college): "game, n., activity
engaged in for diversion or amusement : PLAY." So that means that a "game" is
BETTER if it's more fun to play, right? RIGHT! That's the whole purpose of a
game! I dunno where this whole idea of a game being better cuz it takes more
skill to play came from. Games are better if they are more fun to
play......and I'm sorry for not being a "hardcore" SFer but MvsC is just more
fun to play. It brings people, who are both good and bad at the game, together.
And it's as fair as any other Capcom game: if you know what you're doing, no
scrub will ever defeat you. So stop the whining about the learning curve being
so small, okay? That's irrelevant. I admit that A3 takes more skill to learn
and to play, but so what? The game isn't as fun as MvsC. There isn't ever as
much competition, and the game just gets boring after a while.
Sure u can argue that certain characters (Chun-Li, Strider, Wolverine, etc.)
dominate the game, but the same goes for any fighting game (maybe excluding
KOF97 which was pretty balanced overall if u knew how to play it). If you get
bored with playing as the dominant characters, then get some guts and pick Jin
or Morrigan or someone else.....after all, it would take more SKILL to win with
them, right? And since u love skill so much......

Now I made you look stupid didn't I? That's okay, I'm sure 500 guys who just
want to "go along with the crowd" and conform to popular belief will flame me
for this post, just so they look good.

O well. That's the way the world works.

By the way, I like the religion related quote.

If you *really* want to glitch the machine, there's an easier way to do it.
Have both you and your opponent pick 2 War Machines, then have both of you
charge up two supers, do the team beating, and then finally have all 4 WMs do a
War Destroyer at the same time.

Sayonara!

Yes! There should be a huge red button, kind of like the 3-D button that was
used for War Gods. This will be called the fuck-up button. Any time that you
seem to be losing pretty badly, just hit this button and ***WHAMMO*** your
opponent gets instantly fucked up, losing 3/4 of their life and dizzied. Now
you can mash those buttons to glory! But look out.......if they insert more
quarters during the round, they regain their energy!!!!!!

Okay you guys in the Tri-state area, finally here's the tournament you've been
waiting for!

This Thursday, March 25, at 5:00 P.M., there will be a MvsC tournament at FYE
in Trumbull Shopping Park.
1st Place: a trophy with your name on it, plus 300 arcade tokens, AND a copy of
the tournament on tape. Also, your name will be displayed above the game for
one month.
2nd Place: 200 tokens and a copy of the tourney
3rd Place: 100 tokens and copy of tourney

It's $2 to enter, but you get 8 tokens to play with, so you're not wasting the
money if you lose :)

In addition to all this, there are ***Special Bonuses*** for those that think
they're good enough:
20 tokens for a random select victory (??? there's no random select in MvsC!)
8 tokens for a random helper victory (joy)
100 tokens for a 99 hit infinity (Gambit and Red Venom players rejoice!)
1 token for every hit over fifty in a single match (they're gonna regret this
one)

So come on down and represent! This is the first time a major tourney has ever
been held in Fairfield County, and we expect people from all over CT and maybe
even NY to come and show off their skills.

he did take occasional trips there with a few of his friends (not me, I'm stuck

Hmm....well I knew the roundhouse wouldn't combo, it never does. I would have
suggested trying an airborne Judgement Day after the OTG short, but he can't do
any special moves at that point. Um....I think the only other thing you can do
is an OTG forward, standing forward, which looks pretty sick, but doesn't do a
heck of a lot. Blackheart is definitely a limited character.


>Also I know you can do two infernos... but does the second one always have to

Yes, it has to OTG, because he's too slow for another inferno to come out
before they hit the ground from the first. The only problem is, most people
roll after the first inferno, and so if you go for the second and they roll,
you're combo bait.

>Can you do a heart of darkness after the second inferno?
>

You can go for anything you want after the second inferno. It might not
necessarily hit....

>The only way I can combo Dark Thunder is with D.Fierce (close, so the punch
>hits): D.Fierce XX Jab Dark Thunder.

Don't try to combo it, you can't. It's strickly a keep-away move, and is a lot
more useful when Blackheart is used as a helper character than when he's the
tagged-in fighter. Don't use it, stick strictly to keep-away moves like
standing forward and tick-damage moves like the jumping judgement day.

>Can you do a jump in and subsequently combo S.Rhouse? I can't, but maybe the
>slowdown on the PSX version screws me up... If you

Nope, like I already said, the standing Roundhouse never combos for some
reason.....it kinda ruins the fun of it.

>What is the easiest way to air throw combo with Blackheart? I found wide
>intervals while comboing SJ.Jab, SJ.Short to work well,
>but is there a better way?

Not really. Maybe you can stick an extra jab or short in there for good
measure, but as soon as you do the air strong, you can't throw anymore.

Second, she does significant chipping damage. Third, she's the only helper who

she's pretty deadly.

Ho ho ho.....you'll find none of them here son!

Okay, in all seriousness:
His best regular jump in is fierce, has more priority than short, strong....
I'm not too sure you can combo the supers without the strong.....
You can combo great cyclone off of a standing strong launcher....if your timing
is superb. I've only got it to work once or twice....
Nope, Jin's air combos are pathetic....
Sure you can combo typhoon. How about crouching jab, strong, typhoon?? No
problem!
And no, no way I know to combo his "pinball throw...."

Hope this helped a little.

Right, only if the opponent is on the ground. Do it when they're jumping in,
and he hits them ONCE, and whiffs the rest, leaving him open for a big-damage
combo. Geez, Capcom, get a clue will ya? How many characters start combos on
the ground in this game? Everybody knows that jump-ins (especially crossups)

All I have to say is...ouch.
Mokoto kicks ass. Not because of great combos or supers or anything....
it's because of her crouching forward kick. That thing cancels out just about
EVERY SINGLE other normal in the game, and takes out just about EVERY SINGLE
jumping attack too. She totally eats up opposition because all of their
footgames are useless. The ONLY way I could beat her (of course I mean somebody
who was really good with her) was to pick Hugo and get lucky 360 throws off,
taking massive damage. Otherwise, how can you ever beat her? Here is the only
strategy you need to win:
Stay away at all times when possible! When the opponent comes in for the
attack:
If they jump in, use a crouching forward, or if they're going for an overhead,
her d, df, d + punch move.
If they dash in or walk in for a ground attack, just keep doing well timed low
forwards. It stops every ground game there is, and even stops the
strong+forward overhead.
Fireballs? Come on! This is SF3 man, just parry!

Guess what? You just got yourself invincible defense. The crouching forward
just has too much priority. And if you're an aggressive player, and can't
resist attacking, you can do an occasional dashing punch to catch them
offguard. And if they ever do happen to get close enough to hit you, you can
use the punch super (you know, the one where she punches you a lot of times and
you go flying) to knock them back and take massive damage as well. So have fun
with Mokoto, the easiest character in the game to win with.

>Chun Li coupled with Colossus. It's very simple when you go up against GWM,
>just time the helper attack with Collossus that it freezes GWM in hit stun.

It doesn't, at least not for long. Besides, if you're facing a good GWM player,
he'll be on the way up (jumping) since GWM is best played in the air. So the
most I ever get out of a Collosus is one or two hits....then he continues
jumping up.
However...
I did find a good use for Collosus. As soon as they go for the dual attack,
block as the other WM comes out, then call out the helper. Usually if it's
regular WM, they'll go for a low sweep to try to combo you into countless War
Destroyers....so this totally takes them off guard. If it's GWM, well, he's
stuck in hit stun anyway. So if you have Chun-Li, go for the Kikosho and take
lots of damage off of the War Machine closest to you. The only disadvantage is
that sometimes the other War Machine blocks, or already had the War Destroyer
going, and you end up taking some damage. But it's a small price to pay for
taking 1/2 of a War Machine's life, right?

>All you
>have to do is get on top of GWM and do the stomp kick into double rh's in the
>air.

I'll try it....but I think I've tried this before. The problem is that GWM can
just use that damned jumping Fierce Punch and hit you even after the
stomp-into-RH.

>See Chun-Li's fireball super

>super will kill off what is remaining of GWM's life (I would suggest Jin,
>Strider, Ryu, or anyone with a short delay after there two in one super). And
you won't take any damage either since the ball of energy protects both Chun-Li
and her partner from say war destroyers.

This is NOT necessarily true. If they block right after they activate the dual
attack (if it's regular War Machine, that is) and you do your two-on-one,
you'll be wide open for major damage. This strategy will only work if it's GWM
that's coming out, and if you're playing on a machine that's good enough to get
two-on-ones every time. The ones that I play on usually switch characters by
accident (arg!).

> The key is how good of a WM are you up against? If it's a tourney
>quality WM then expect a tough fight just to kill WM off, but if it's just

Oh sure, of course I have to play against Rob Aponte, who won 2nd at ECC4. Oh
well....we just had a local tourney and I got 2nd (Rob got first but we both
fought down to the wire). I used Chun-Li and Wolverine. By the way, Wolverine
is pretty good against normal War Machine, since his Fatal Claw goes through
his knee dive....oh darn, half of WM's strategy is gone.


>Let's say you can't get the two on one off against WM/GWM.
>Sometimes WM/GWM starts the war destroyers at the same time.

Hardly ever, if you're playing Rob.

>I'm
>still testing this out and I would like to hear what you people think.
>Chun-Li
>just man handles almost everyone on MvC except good ol Gief.

Shyeah right! If there's anything I've learned, it's that nobody really
manhandles anybody if you know what you're doing. If you don't believe me, go
around the country and play all the competition. I guarantee you you'll find
people who can take some of the worst characters (like Morrigan and Gambit) and
whup Chun-Li's ass. This is why this game has amazing longevity....how long has
it been out now, two years? Even longer I think. But people still play it
because the game is so deep that you just keep coming back for more. In fact I
fear the release of Capcom's next versus game....if SNK versus Capcom is
anything like the previous VS series, I can guarantee that it won't be as good
as MvsC, but you know that everybody's going to play it anyway. Oh
well.....back to Guitar Freaks for me!

perfect timing (as in, wait 2-3 seconds, so the missiles are overhead, then do
the Captain Sword). If you mistime.....well, kiss Cap goodbye. And the only
other problem is that both War Machines have to be on the same side of you. But
this strategy is useless against skilled War Machine players, who either cross
up with the duo, or attempt to sweep you and juggle with the War Destroyer
(which puts them way too close for you to safely do the Captain Sword).

There was a big Marvel vs. Capcom tourney in CT today, and here's just a few of
the things that I saw that really impressed me:

Red/White Venom actually does have two real infinites. The first of which you
guys probably have already seen: just knock them up with fierce punch near the
corner, do the normal air combo, but do it REALLY slowly (for white venom
anyways) so that the last hit of the jumping roundhouse connects just before
they hit the ground. Then when they land, OTG them with a standing short, then
do repeated crouching strong->crouching FP, crouching strong->crouching FP,
etc......ouch, it's pretty easy from there on in.
But then I saw something I couldn't believe: the simplest infinite ever. Just
do a normal jump forward and catch them in the air (they have to be jumping
too) with a forward->roundhouse chain. Land, jump back up, juggle with another
forward->roundhouse while they're still in the air (the first time is the only
tricky part), land, jump again, etc. It's ridiculously easy and ridiculously
cheesy. I couldn't believe my eyes, and neither could anyone else.
As if these two tactics weren't enough, Red/White Venom is a ground monster
too. That ducking FP is sick man! I've heard that SpiderDan is king of R/WV, I
hope I can see him play one day.

Overall, the tourney was pretty much a success. We had 43 entrees, although
about 3 didn't show. In the end, it came down to me (Phil Burnell, don't know
if anybody's heard of me besides Viscant) and Rob Aponte, who got 2nd at ECC4.
Well let me just put it this way: after the results of the last tourney (Rob
beat me, sent me to the loser's bracket, I fought my way back up to him and
beat him once, but then he barely won the final match, I was stuck with 2nd and
disgruntled) I was pretty determined to do my best. Well it finally came down
to me and Rob again...only this time I beat his double War Machines with
Wolverine/Ryu. Let me tell ya, Wolverine is the GWM killer! Jumping FP->RH,
drill claw away. He can't do anything to retaliate, and you can do it all over
again. If he tries the knee drop->FP->standing forward->shoulder cannon
(missle), just push block and throw. He was mad, you could tell. Ryu isn't too
shabby either: walk underneath GWM's knee drop and throw, then call out
Colossus while he's getting up (he's stuck in hitstun) and shinkuu-hadoken. And
if he goes for the aerial smart bomb, jump up to him and shinkuu-hadoken right
through it. I didn't even try to stop his dual attack because I didn't want to
risk it, so I just blocked and took all that damage from about 10 War
Destroyers. Well anyways I beat Rob and sent him to the losers bracket....and
no surprise he fought his way to the top and defeated Brian Jin (I think that's
how you spell it) although his White Venom almost killed him, until a massive
comeback. By the way, I hear that Brian got all his White Venom skills from
watching SpiderDan in action...anyways! It came down to me (I was undefeated)
and Rob again. It was kind of ironic, because last tournament HE had been
undefeated, and I had fought my way to the top of the loser's bracket to fight
him again. Well to make a long story short (too late!) I used the same tactics
and beat him. So I was undefeated for the whole tournament, and received $75 in
tokens. I was SUPPOSED to get a tape of the tourney, but of course they didn't
record it....arg, cheap bastards.
Actually, Rob could have beaten me if he had used Strider or Zangief in place
of GWM, simply because I can trash him now. I'm surprised he didn't try it out.
Oh well, until the next tourney.....

WhoaMoses, KING of all things Video
My favorite quote came from Rob: "I knew that if somebody would beat me, it
would be you....because of those bitchy throwing tactics."
My reply: "Victory, by any means necessary...."

This happened to me too. I don't have a switch, so I use the super-dangerous


cartridge swap technique because I'm reckless. Anyway, it happens every once in
a while (particularly when you try to play a game like KOF96 with the 4meg RAM
cart instead of a 1meg one, it works if you jiggle the cartridge but it's
glitchy). Basically I just reset the Saturn about 500 times until I could get
it to work....it can really be a bitch, but it doesn't last forever. I don't
know if it has anything to do with the lithium battery, i didn't touch mine,
but it still works fine now.

*sigh* Now i hafta retype all of this:

Okay, the two Red/White Venom infinites are:

1.) Knock them up with a standing fierce punch near the corner (very important,
they MUST be in the corner for this to work). Jump after them, do the basic air
combo chain (jab, short, strong, forward, fierce, roundhouse), but SLOWLY (for
Red Venom anyway) so that the last hit of the roundhouse connects just as
they're about to land. If done correctly, you should land just as they do. Now,
do a standing short to OTG them, then a crouching strong->fierce punch,
crouching strong->fierce punch, etc.

2.) As the opponent is jumping towards you, jump forward and do a quick
forward->roundhouse chain in the air. You will land before them, so jump
forward again and repeat. If timed correctly (basically just keep holding
up-forward on the joystick and pressing forward->roundhouse when you reach
them) it is a ridiculously easy, ridiculously cheesy infinite combo which blew
my socks off.....luckily nobody figured it out until AFTER the tournament was
over.

Hmm...well, to be honest the whole thing is pretty damned fast....and I believe
now that you reminded me that I've seen it done both with fierce punch and
roundhouse. But fierce punch is easier, it's what everybody was using.

>2) When I try to repeat the fierce, strong OTG, the
>fierce knocks venom back too much, to where the strong can't reach.

This must be a new addition (or correction) to the Dreamcast version. In the
arcade, Red/White Venom is not pushed back at all after using the crouching
fierce punch, which is why this infinite works. It's like he crouches and
sticks to the ground and just keeps going and going and going...


>It seems that they recover from the roundhouse too quickly to combo. I have
>tried fierce-roundhouse in the air, and that seems better, but still no
>infinite.

I dunno, maybe this was fixed too? All I know is it was definitely
forward->roundhouse. First all those sharp edges came out of Venom, then he
turned liquidy and did that multi-hit air bite thing where the snakes swirl
around him. So I'm sure it was those buttons.

>I am not telling you, you are wrong, I am just looking for any input or tips
>that I am missing.

No offense taken. Hey, I haven't even tried to do the infinites myself, I'm
just relating what I saw at the tournament. If you say it doesn't work in the
Dreamcast version, it probably doesn't. Most likely, Capcom fixed the infinites
to make the game more balanced. I wonder if Gambit's infinite is still in
there? If you honestly want to try to get the Red Venom infinites to work, I
suggest taking a trip to the local arcade.

Um.....where did you get this info? Because at 3 arcades that I go to, there is
most definitely a singing voice in the backround, and I'm pretty sure that all
of them didn't get the Japanese version of the game.

that's "right near there" where they sell Dreamcasts for $175. But I went there

What's really funny here, is that a few months ago I was the only guy on this
MB who disliked A3. While everybody else was saying it was better than ST and
the best street fighter ever....i was arguing how hella boring the game was.
It's slow, and most of the characters STILL suck (instead of tweaking the
characters, it seemed like only a select few were left the same and everybody
else was weakened, therefore making the untouched characters "better" than all
the others). I said that overall MvC was a better game, not because it has
better play mechanics or better characters or combos....but because overall
it's just a hell of a lot more fun to play. But everybody flamed me (what's
funny is that all the people who flamed me, no longer post on this board, so
what happened to them?). Of course I knew this would happen....when a game is
relatively new, everybody is so high on the hype that even if the game sucked
huge ass they'd swear it was the best thing they'd ever seen. Hell, the same
thing happened with Zelda 64, until everybody realized it was just 60 hours of
the same repetitive dungeon-exploring bull$hit.

>SFA3 is still good in my eyes, I don't play at the level where the

If you play the game at home by yourself, and so the abusable nuances don't
affect you, then more power to ya. But the fact remains that the game is just
shit at a highly competitive level. Oh, yeah, by the way, if you think A3 is
better than KOF98....get the Dreamcast versions of both games. I'd go with
KOF98 any friggin day, with better music, more frames of animation (and much
better art), more characters, etc. So what if there are only 2 modes of play
instead of three? At least the game is fun to play due to the above.

Okay, so I'm not Spider-Dan. But I am friends with Rob Aponte, the guy who got
2nd at ECC4 with his double War Machines. And since I play him just about every
day, I guess I know a little bit about your questions.

>Can he knee dive from a normal jump? I could only get him
>to knee from a super jump. Was I just on a horrible
>joystick?

As far as I can tell, no. Rob never does it from a normal jump.

>When people do moves that go toward me, such as Wolverine's
>Beserker Barrage thing, should I hit them with Fierce,
>Forward or RH to launch? Do I do standard WM air combo of
>SJ jab, short, strong, up+fierce?

It depends on what you want to do to them, and how close they are. If they are
still pretty far away, use standing forward and chain into a shoulder missle
(fireball + kick). But if they're right next to ya (i.e., after a Berserker
Barrage X) use standing roundhouse and air combo. Rob uses this air combo all
the time that goes something like SJ jab, short, strong, shoulder missle.

>What about people that start off by throwing a ton of
>colossues and supers out at me? Should I be superjumping
>and doing smart bomb into shoulder cannon, repeat until
>ground?

Basically, GWM should be in the air at all times. So as soon as the round
starts, you have a lot of options. You can SJ, and then either throw a smart
bomb (by the way, don't ever use the shoulder missle in the air unless in a
combo, it leaves him WAAAY too open for moves like the Shinkuu-Hadoken) or use
a knee drop, or both. You'll find that the knee drop, if timed correctly, will
negate most helpers and special moves, even supers. And if it doesn't, you can
actually cancel into another smart bomb. Example: You're knee dropping, when
all of a sudden Chun-Li desides to use a surprise Kikosho. Don't fret: as soon
as the Kikosho starts to hit, cancel into a smart bomb. GWM actually bounces
off the energy ball with his knees, and moves UP a few pixels for some reason.
Now you're perfectly safe.

>What helper should I be using? Lou doesn't seem to work
>that well, so I went back to using Colossus for Double War
>Machine.

As far as I can tell, it doesn't really matter. Rob thinks he's so good, he
always uses random helpers. You're right tho, Lou is kinda useless since GWM
can't cross-up. Use the basics like Colussus and Psylocke, and combo into
Proton Cannon.

>When going for the Duo, should I be taking advantage that
>GWM can get hit and still do moves? In other words, take a
>hit on purpose and activate the Duo when they are reeling?

You should ALWAYS be taking advantage that GWM can get hit and still do moves.
The best time to activate the duo seems to be after somebody lands a super on
you, or when they're attacking while airborne.

>Speaking of the Duo, is it just me or is the timing weird?
>If I start both doing the war destroyer move right away, it

>what I'm talking about? Any 'real' suggestion on how to
>make it stagger and not get killed?
>

Hmm.....I don't quite understand you here. I know that if you immediately do a
War Destroyer motion after the duo is activated, both WMs will generally start
the move at the same time. So when they finish, they will be wide open for a
few seconds. The best thing to do is to get GWM next to your opponent, because
if they try to hit him at any time, they eat missles since he doesn't stun. To
mix up the double team a little, use a crouching forward to knock them down,
then OTG with double War Destroyer. Usually, the only way you can get double
WMs NOT to do the War Destroyers at the same exact time (so basically there's
no "lag time" between their supers and you're totally safe) is when one of them
is getting attacked, and so can't do their super. But I'm not the expert on
that, so don't quote me or anything.

>Speaking of which, can Captain Commando do his punch super
>in the very begininng 'For Free' everytime? I tried to be
>tricky and do the fireball+kick move at the start of the

Well, basically the sword super only takes damage if you're standing on the
ground. If in the air, it only takes a pixel or two. So just SJ immediately as
the round starts, or jump forward and use down+fierce, or jump backward,
whatever. Just as long and you're not on the ground when the sword touches you,
you won't take any sufficient damage. I'm sure that the shoulder missle can
knock Cap out of the sword if timed correctly, but it's better to jump and not
risk mistiming it and eating 50% damage.

It was probably Eddie, since I've never seen anything like that before. Sounds
like something Rob would get really pissed about, it's so simple. I would
assume it's a pretty good strategy, except that it leaves GWM wide open for
helpers like Colossus.

>Shin-Shoryuken that *WHIFFS*. (yes, saw this today, more than once...)

Hmmm....maybe that's because it works, if it happens to even tap the opponent?
You see, if you don't initially connect the Shin-Shoryuken and get the 4-hit
big damage auto-combo, it turns into a juggle move of sorts. Once I was Ryu,
and my opponent was Wolverine. I had only a sliver of energy left, he had about
one-third of his. Well, he decided to use a well timed Fatal Claw right after I
did a whiffed crouching roundhouse. I decided to try something stupid to save
my life....so I did a Shin-Shoryuken. Ryu became invincible, flew up with the
uppercut, and tagged Wolvie in midair, out of the Fatal Claw. I immediately
began mashing the buttons, and amazingly the move which I thought for certain
would whiff turned into a massive 9 hit juggle combo that just barely KILLED
Wolverine! It was pretty damned amazing.

So....don't criticise, because anything is possible.

It's pretty simple actually. It's something Capcom has been doing for years.
Don't let them fool you; they probably have third strike completed for DC
already. However...
Think of it this way. If you release third strike and SF3 Double impact at the
same time, who would buy double impact? Nobody, since the newer game is also
out there. So....what Capcom will do, is release Double impact just in time for
the holiday season (it makes the perfect Christmas gift! seems like a decent ad
campaign, no?). Then, one month later, they'll release third strike, so all
those kiddies who saved up their christmas money can get it. So, by doing this,
they sell two games instead of one, and a hell of a lot of them to boot due to
the holidays. Get it?

<<On a different note, anyone bought KOF99 for Dreamcast? I like the game but
I hate how they made it seem like it was gonna be different from KOF98

It IS the same damn thing dude. The only real difference is that the music is
remixed, the graphics are cleaner, and the backrounds are 3D (they kick ass!).
But other than that (and the fact that you can play as Omega Rugal) the game is
exactly the same. The real KOF 99 will be released for DC tho.

I think that speed is an important factor in the enjoyment level of any
game. Generally, the more fast-paced a game, the more fun it is. Of
course, there are exceptions (anybody remember the old SNES version of
SF2T, with the 10-star speed setting? It was a trip!) But the tendency
is that as games progress, they get faster...SF2, SF2CE, SF2Turbo, SSF2
(an exception, which generally got bad ratings because it was too
slow), SSFT2, then the Alpha series which generally kept the same speed
throughout, then SF3 which was rated slow and therefore inferior, and
the versus series which is faster than the rest. Faster games are more
fun to play because you have to be REALLY good to react in time, so if
you can amass a good number of wins then you know that you must have
some skills to speak of.
And as for RV in MvsC, did you play with him on the highest speed
setting?????? Its just sickening, he doesn't ever materialize solidly,
just those transparent shadows....

> something.


My goodness...if you don't agree that Strider needs to be toned down,
you must either be a biased Strider player, or you just haven't played

any good Striders. I live in CT, and if anybody remembers ECC4, they'll
remember how CT represented in the MvsC tourney. There are some really
good Strider players here, who make life hard for anybody else (even
Wolverine!) How, you ask??? Well..
1.) Strider has INSANE priority over most other characters' normal
attacks. His standing forward is just ridiculous....try to do a dashing-
in combo with Wolvie, go ahead, against a Strider standing forward, and
just see what happens....a 4-hit 40% combo, that's what!
And his jumping forward is sick too....Strider can basically stay in
the air all day if he wants, just jumping and using well-timed normal
attacks because of that damned sword.


2.) The Oroborous. Let's face it: any super that attempts to give you
an infinite-combo ability for a limited time is just lame anyway. When
I first saw this super 2 years ago, I thought it would be either
devastatingly cheesy, or worthless...well, to most people it is pretty
worthless. But to a skilled CT player, it is simply step 2 in Strider's
cheese ability. No Jinston, you are NOT the MvsC god that you seem to
think you are, the Oroborous is not so easy to get out of. Just push
block, and super jump??? What planet are you on fool? Any good Strider
player taps a button, then dashes forward to start you blocking...if
you super jump right away, he jumps a little and does the QCF+Punch
teleport-type move to get a ring to touch you on the way down. Either

way you end up blocking....now try to push-block, go ahead. If you're
playing a good Strider player, he's already done 2 of the 4-hit ground
combos and charged another super meter. And sometimes they teleport
right behind you, forcing you to block with no escape...and no, you
CAN'T super jump after a push block because the rings still keep you
blocking, idiot. Your haughty, know-it-all attitude is not appreciated,
especially when you're WRONG.


3.) As if these weren't enough, you can use Psylock to do a 100% combo:
Psylocke, Legion, Psylocke, another Legion, Psylocke, Legion...and you
can stick an Oroborous, teleport behind anywhere in there too. So have
fun.

If Strider isn't toned down, the game will suck. Nuff' said.

Hmm, I never thought that posting my personal experience with throws
would create such an uproar. After reading all of these posts, it seems
to me that throwing is generally accepted and used by most people, and
that only scrubs bitch about it (notice I said GENERALLY not ALWAYS. I
remember the original SF2 ticks which drove me batty, and I bitched
many a time...) What's funny is that people talk about playing the game
with "honor", and that's why they don't throw....but if you do it to
them, they shoot you! What honor! I'm so sick of this world, where
these pussies can simply buy a gun and they think they're "the shit." I
see it every day in my town, these little fucking wimps who like to
call themselves "thugs" and pretend that they're "tough mofos." Well if
I ever get into a fight with one of them, hand-to-hand, I guarantee you
I'LL be the one standing afterwards. And if they pull a gun on me? I
hope they have pretty good aim, because if they don't hit me with the
first shot, I'll have already punctured their windpipe and ended their
life...

Am I afraid to throw in fighting games? No. I've done it since the very
first day that SF2 was released in arcades (which I can still remember
clearly) and I'll continue to do it for the rest of my life. I will not
let ANYONE intimidate me. Believe me many have tried, and failed. In
the end they either just complained a whole lot, out loud, or tried to
insult me by calling me a no-skill scrub. Usually I just let it go...on
occasion I can't control myself and I say something back, but so far
that's as far as it's gone. Nobody has tried to attack me or shoot me
because of it (although a lot of people have talked shit but never came
through with it), and hopefully nobody ever will. After all, it IS only
a game, and it's not worth getting killed over, right? There are only
two reasons that you can possibly lose:
1.) Outside factors, like somebody is bugging you while you're playing,
or the controls are broken, etc.
or
2.) Your skills were inferior to the other player's. They used
infinites, throws, over-powered characters, combos, strategies,
whatever, to beat you, and you lost. Now GET OVER IT and either don't
play anymore if it makes you upset, or renew your conviction and try
again. You can't get better if you don't lose and learn from the losses.

Now if you lose because of #1, I can see why you'd be mad. You are then
justified to beat the fuck out of whoever was distracting and bothering
you, or you can give shit to the owner of the arcade for having a
broken game. But if the reason is #2, and you lose, and you bitch to
the other player about it, FUCK YOU. You are a loser. I bitch a lot,
but when I do, I NEVER blame it on the other player being cheesy...I
try to blame it on the controls or something. I know that deep down it
was my fault that I lost, but I'm not about to yell at the top of my
lungs I'M A FUCKING LOSER! But I never accuse the other player of being
cheap...I accept everything, from infinites to throws to even
ridiculous Strider and Ibuki over-priority (I had to accept it, I was
one of Tee Carter's best friends and he always had a knack for finding
out who the over-powered character was in the 1st week a game was
out...and then he'd never use anyone else. Arg.) I remember, Tee would
complain too about my throwing, but he never fought me about it or
anything. If he got mad, he'd just stop playing for a while and cool
down, and come back when he wasn't mad anymore. He admitted that throws
were NOT cheating, or cheap, but just another part of the game that
needed to be overcome to win. Tee was a very smart kid, for the place
where he came from (very bad area) and how underpriviledged he was.
What happened to him? He was killed by a thug, for no reason. The guy
didn't even know him...

I think that the problem with throwing is 2 things:
1.) Normal people get annoyed by it. They bitch about it (which is
perfectly ok). Some people can handle it, learn from it, and use it to
their advantage. Others can accept it and choose not to use it. Then
there are those who just can't accept it, because they simply aren't
smart enough to learn how to counter it, and so to cover up their
inadequacies they say "you're a scrub," or "you fight without honor,
because you have to throw to win." Whatever. If you think it's
dishonorable to throw in a fighting game, you need to look up what the
defenition of honor really means. Now get the fuck out of my arcade you
loser. YOU are problem #1.
2.) Problem #2 is thugs, who think they rule the world and are the
shit. If anybody beats them, they go nuts and start shooting people.
About that shooting in Atlanta...I bet you that even if the person
hadn't thrown, they still would have been shot. The shooter obviously
was a self-conscious little fuck who felt like an ass for being beat,
got really mad, and didn't know how to deal with his anger, so he shot
the guy. Oh boy, what a man he was. Truly full of "honor."


In conclusion, I think that we gamers have to take a stand against this
general "bitchiness" that has seeped into our arcades. The next time
somebody complains about you throwing, tell him "Look, either play me
again and learn how to get around it, or just don't play me anymore.
Either way, stop bitching, because only pathetic people bitch. Just
learn from your mistakes, and beat me!" And if you're afraid of getting
shot? Don't go to that arcade anymore. Let the idiots shoot themselves
and kill themselves off. Believe me guys, it won't last much longer
anyways.

Good gaming to everyone, throwers and non-throwers alike.

Actually, if he did do what you say he did, he's absolutely right. I've
been doing this for a long time now, and it freaks out most opponents.
If you dash quickly enough and time it right, you can also make
Colossus come out of the OPPOSITE side of the screen and make him hit
the opponent from the back!

I was just thinking, isn't it going to really change the game when
there are only 4 attack buttons? I mean, how on earth will the computer
be able to distinguish when you want to chain two quick jabs, or use a
strong punch? What will this do to the chain combos? If Capcom wanted
to have separate "tag" buttons for each character, they should have
ADDED extra ones, not taken away attack buttons and tried to make
medium attacks, well, bootleg. The buttons are really gonna be breaking
quickly with all the double tapping...
How would you do, say, Strider's standing jab->strong->forward->fierce?
Tap jab, then jabjab really quick, shortshort really quick, fierce?
Isn't that a little bit difficult (especially when controls usually
aren't pinpoint accurate)? I'm just afraid that this is going to
totally change the mechanics of the game, and make it simpler.

I'm honestly glad that the US VMU support has been dropped. Whether it
will now be time-released, or codes, EVERYBODY will be able to play as
the Dreamcast characters, not only those who have a Japanses Dreamcast
(I thought this was pretty stupid to begin with).

Since such a horrible exemption was made from ECC this year, FMJaguar and I are
holding a MvsC2 DC tournament during ECC, most likely on Saturday. I would LOVE
to have it at the Break, but I need support. If you're going to ECC and want to
see this tournament happen, POST HERE!!! Also, e-mail Zer...@goto.thebreak.net
and tell him you want to see MvsC2 Dreamcast tourney at the Break!!!!

I'm holding a MvsC2 DC tournament at Motel 6 saturday night, after all the
tournaments at ECC are finished (which could be anytime from 9-12, but we're
STILL having the tournament, even if it takes all morning). Entrance fee is $5,
1st prize is 60% of money plus a NeoGeoPocket Color w/SNKvsCapcom and
FatalFury. Please bring your MAS sticks if you can. I already have numerous
people volunteering their DCs/rooms, so if you can bring your modded DC with
MvsC2, DO IT. It will be MUCH better to have too many than not enough. Hope to
see you all there.

Here's my log from today's huge CT MvsC2 tournament:

Let me give my account of the August 3rd tournament at FYE, which I just got
home from. I think this was probably the most exciting and eventful tournament
there has been at FYE in a long time.

First of all, this being Bobby's last tournament (he was the manager of the
arcade for a while), he decided to make it a lot more professional than the
last few. Even thought it started late, as usual, he brought back the tables
and the barriers to make more room for the players, and he made a real effort
to make this the fairest and most fun tournament in a while. There were over
TWICE the amount of players from the last tournament, I think the final count
was something like 32. Bobby decided to do his usual "weird" thing; this time
it wasn't setting the game on low damage, but making ALL THE FIRST ROUND
MATCHES best 2 out of 3, and having all the other matches single fights. Bad
idea, because now you've got 16 matches that ALL extended into three rounds
each....that's a whopping 48 matches in the first round alone. Surprisingly in
an upset, I lost my first round matches, in which I used either
Doom/Cable/Blackheart or Cyclops/Cable/Blackheart, to Waterbury's Richie
(Doom/Cable/Cyclops). For some reason I was having a hard time with him,
probably because his Cable was more than decent and I'm not used to that.
Anyways I should have won the first match, but instead of just blocking Doom's
blue energy ball super, I called a helper on reaction by accident and ended up
losing by mere pixels because of a time out. So the second match began...and I
destroyed him, still having nearly full health bars for both Cable and
Blackheart. I don't remember much about the third match, except that I got my
ass beat pretty bad. Wow, did that get my spirits down. I honestly have no
excuse besides I smoke too much dope. Well, anyways, the rest of the first
round finished much as predicted, with the regulars winning over the
not-so-regulars.

One thing that was very unfortunate, however, was the woman who just out of the
blue started having seizures in the middle of the arcade. If anybody has ever
seen someone having a seizure, they know how horrible it looks, and the thing
is, there's really nothing you can do unless you're a trained doctor and know
what's going on. The woman is retarded, I always see her and her husband in the
mall almost every day for the past two years, and nothing like this has ever
happened before. I really feel bad, and sad that some people have to go through
things like that. It makes you look on your own life and you realize just how
much you really have, and how good you have it, compared to other people.

Anyways, continuing with my tournament log. After my first loss, I felt pretty
stupid and embarrassed, so I felt like doing something to feel better. I was
pretty hungry, all I'd had to eat all day was a yogurt and two slices of french
toast, so I decided to get something for everybody to eat. Money is no big deal
to me, so I went to Dunkin' Donuts and bought three dozen assorted donuts and
50 munchkins for everybody to enjoy. It cost me $21.59, what a jerk, he
wouldn't give me a mall discount even though I've worked in the mall for over 2
years. For the most part it was a success, everybody seemed really happy, but
there were about 25 munchkins and 12 donuts left after everything was done. I
was feeling pretty mad that nobody would eat my donuts, then somebody from FYE
ran in and stole them...so at least they went to good use. Good stuff. I think
a lot more people like me now, heh.

Anyways, now with the actual tournament results. My next match was against Matt
(GohanFan's little brother) and I was really hungry, so I ate a donut and drank
a soda while fighting him. I know it seemed really insulting, but I was really
hungry and I mean everybody knew I was going to win anyway, so I just had to. I
beat him fairly easily and moved on.

My next match was against black Rich, who I heard had just won a New Britain
tournament and a few others. I was a little intimidated when we started to
fight, but apparently he was more so: he seemed more worried about the match
than I was. Rightly so I guess, because his Magneto/IronMan/? couldn't stand up
to the cheap chipping patterns and instant Air Hyper Viper Beams of my feared
Doom/Cable/Blackheart team.

Now here's where the big problem was: Ryan showed up over an hour late for the
tournament, and Bobby still let him enter! And he was equal with ME for some
reason, getting a bye! AND he was my next match! Everybody knows that Ryan and
I have a rivalry going and that we go back and forth between who's the best, so
I knew it would be a tough match. It was his Strider/Doom/Blackheart versus my
Doom/Cable/Blackheart. I wondered why he literally RAN to the lefthand side of
the machine before our match started.....and I found out why while I was
playing. I could NOT do ONE photon charge in the air with Doom no matter how I
tried, I think the stick was just too loose or something at that time. I know
the stick worked fine later on in the night...but it just didn't feel right
during that match. I don't know how else to explain it, maybe my hand just
didn't feel like working, but every time I tried to do the Blackheart
assist/Doom photon charge trap, Doom would do a jab instead of the lazers and I
would end up having to block a Strider/Doom chipping rush. So I realized my
Doom was useless and tagged in Cable....big mistake, I forgot that Cable dies
to Strider/Doom chipping trap fairly easily, and that the Blackheart
assist/jump back viper beam trap wouldn't work because he had Blackheart too
and he was getting his helper off before mine. So finally I got Blackheart in
there, and did my thing. It ended up that I wittled him down to just Strider
and Doom, against my Blackheart and Doom. In the LAST seconds of the match, he
managed to do a Photon Array for LOTS of chip, then switch to Strider and run
away for about 2 seconds, for the win. A win by about ONE pixel of energy with
a time out. Obviously I was pissed: I know I can beat Ryan, I do it all the
time, if my Photon Charges had come out I would have definitely gotten my trap
patterns down and won the match. And he shouldn't have been allowed to play
anyway! After the match Ryan tried to talk shit, but I just pointed at the
energy bars and said "pixels my friend. you won by PIXELS. I hope you feel
lucky."

At this point I was feeling like an idiot and I re-entered by paying Bobby $3.
Sux, but I had to do it. I know my first loss was bullshit, and my second loss
was even worse. I was put in a match against Web, who in my opinion is
underrated, because he's very good, a great thinker, who can adapt to
situations quicker than a lot of other player's I've faced. He figured out how
to get out of my Doom/BH trap pretty well, then he somehow managed to kill
Cable off fairly easily. I barely was able to beat him with
Blackheart...definitely a close match and one of my favorites of the night.
Many props to Web.

At this point there was some controversy: the mall was going to close very
soon, as in less than an hour, and we still had over 20 matches left. Everybody
was wondering if we would be allowed to finish the tournament....but everything
ended up fine. Why? Because Bobby called about three names, and the people
weren't there, so they were eliminated. And guess what? One of them was RYAN of
all people. He showed up like 30 seconds late and was really pissed. I'm sure I
would be too, but first of all don't show up 2 hours late for the tournament,
and second of all BE THERE FOR YOUR TURN especially when you're extremely
pressed for time. So I guess I lucked out with Ryan's getting eliminated for
free....I honestly wanted to play him again and prove that I can beat him,
because I KNOW I can, I've done it lots of times before....but it didn't
happen. Kind of dick on Bobby's part but it had to be done to save time.

At this point, it was already 9:30, and the arcade was supposed to be closed,
but since this was Bobby's last tournament (he has a better job now) it was
allowed to finish. But everyone who wasn't playing, or who got beaten, was made
to leave. So about 14 people got kicked out leaving about 10 players in the
arcade.

My next few matches were against Jose and Germaine, I don't remember much
besides me winning pretty straightforward. It's kind of hard to use rushing
characters against teams like mine, who just stay away all day and throw shit
all over the screen, never putting their physical bodies in danger.

My next match, for 4th place, was against Shoubert. We really haven't played
each other for a long time, Shu is always at work at Pretzel Time and so he
really doesn't get much practice in....but let me tell you, he surprised the
HELL out of me. He nearly beat me, taking me by surprise and really preventing
me from using any of my trap patterns very effectively. Neither of us could
really catch the other one with ANYTHING, not supers or combos or much of
anything except a roundhouse kick here or a random super there. We both had SO
much life left when time ran out...but it ended up that I had a little more, so
I won. Once again, MANY props to Shu for surprising me and staying good at the
game even when he doesn't get to play it much.

Next was for third place, and of all the people, I had to fight RICHIE, the guy
who had managed to beat me in the first round. Our rematch was on. But I had
him this time: I stopped fucking around, I ignored the cheers and jeers of all
the other Waterbury players, and I managed to beat him convincingly. Good match
tho, once again I was really surprised, he wasn't that good at MvsC1, but he's
definitely the best in Waterbury at part 2 right now.

And so it came down to just me and Bobby, just like last time. Considering that
he learned how to play with Blackheart and Cable by watching me, I knew I had a
distinct advantage over him, but then he picked Iron Man, and Bobby's Iron Man
is more than decent. But I shut him down: both his Iron Man and Blackheart
could do nothing against my Blackheart assist but eat ice columns all day long.
I did have a little bit of trouble with his Cable though, mainly due to his
Blackheart assist that made it hard for me to do anything, but in the end I was
triumphant again.

So that was it. It was now 10:10 and everything was closed in the mall except
for the arcade, which was pitch black. Everybody left and I got my tokens and
left. I was so tired, playing games from 5 to 10, and having to fight my way
through the entire losers' and winners' brackets AGAIN for the comeback
victory.

In conclusion, I have to mention and respect the skills of a lot of players who
I faced today, specifically Web, Richie, Shoubert, Bobby, and Rich. You guys
are really good, keep up the practicing and you'll get better. Seeing what I
saw today, I believe that CT is very close to being able to compete with the
rest of the country in MvsC2. Maybe I can get some people to come with me to
the August 27th tournament at Chinatown Fair in NYC to help represent CT. And
to Ryan: You may have won the single battle, but not the war. Your foolishness
got you eliminated from the tournament, which sucked, because I wanted to face
you again and prove that your narrow victory was just a fluke. Damned missed
photon charges. Anyways, I will challenge you ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, remember that,
and I'll once again prove that I'm more than able to beat you.

In closing, I did just what I said I would do: I won the tournament, and
although it wasn't total domination, I am a human being who makes
mistakes....and it was those stupid mistakes that almost cost me my victory. I
need to practice more of my patterns and traps to become good enough to
represent CT next month at Chinatown, and in September at the nationals in
Chicago. But my ability to come back, fight my way through the losers' bracket,
and take the win even despite my losses, proves that I am, right now, the best
in CT, and the best candidate to represent us in big tournaments. Nuff' said.


The final rankings:
1. Phil a.k.a. Darksyde (Doom/Cable/Blackheart)
2. Bobby a.k.a. Mr. FYE (Iron Man/Cable/Blackheart)
3. Richie a.k.a. Mr. Waterbury (Cyclops/Cable/Doom)
4. Shoubert a.k.a. PretzelMan (Iron Man/Cable/?)

Just reposting this, because a lot of people said it didn't show up on
their NG readers...

Today there was a tournament in Meriden....a full state tournament for
MvsC2 in Connecticut....this is my log of my personal experiences
during the tournament.

The tournament was a surprising success. Even though it was delayed a
week (because a button broke last week and the arcade employees were
unable to fix it), I think it was honestly the best
MvsC2 tournament that has been held in CT. I think just about EVERBODY
was there....around 40 people...with the exception of maybe Bobby,
Shoubert, Rob Aponte, and Dru....but without a doubt there were people
there to take their place anyway. Due to LOTS of traffic delays (the
Merritt Parkway was backed up for about a half hour), the tournament
started an hour late. The matches were different from last week: to
save time, all matches up to the semi-finals would be single fights,
while the semis would be best 2 out of 3. Well the tournament started
out typically, with regulars like P.J. (Essex on IRC)
(Spiral/Magneto/?), me (Darksyde) (Doom/Cyke/Cable), Ryan Lee
(Strider/Cyclops/Doom), Brian Jin (Strider/Doom/Cable), Rich Williams
(Cable/Magneto/Iron Man), Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron), a
kid named Andrew from Meriden (Magneto/Iron Man/?), and others winning
their first round matches without much of a hitch, quickly weeding out
most of the scrubs. But to a lot of people's surpirse, some of the more
favored players actually LOST their first round matches...Kev
(Cammy/Storm/Commando) and others. Why? Well let me explain something
about the controllers at Meriden Arcade (Jester's Courtyard). They're
DIAGONAL FROM THE SCREEN. That's right, they are diagonal, forcing you
to look at the game from an awkward angle. Let me explain in more
detail:

The face of the controls on a normal cabinet is set up like this:

l joy1 buttons joy2 buttons l
l________________________________l

coinslot coinslot

But at Meriden arcade, it's set up like this:
\ /
\ joy1(angled) buttons(angled)/
\ buttons(ang.) joy2(angled) /
\___________________________/
coinslot coinslot

So basically, you're forced to stand diagonally to play the game. Why
is this bad? Because most players, by reflex, try to correct their
stance to face the game straight during a heated match.....forcing them
to hold the joystick wrong....and miss simple moves like AHVB or just
blocking low. A LOT of people were complaining about this, and it was
very evident that during about 90% of the matches, at some point
someone would miss something that should have connected, simply because
they were not used to the controls. I thought the loose stickes at
ECC2000 were ghey, until I went to Meriden and saw the Clown Machine.

Anyways....
Trying to remember some of the better matches and strategies...
It seemed like in general people wanted to take a break from
Blackheart, I was the only person in the entire tournament to use him.
Most of the winning teams instead consisted of Doom/Cable/Cyke/Strider
combinations. There really wasn't much new to see, besides that Cable
is still a royal pain in the ass, and that besides Cable and Commando,
Doom really doesn't have any bad matches to speak of. Some notable
moments:
I think it was P.J. against Ty Pathammavong (who is, by the way, the
ONLY person ranked in CT on the CTF website for the MvsC2 100 hits
tourney this Sunday....and he told me he isn't even going, wtf) in the
semi-finals of the losers bracket......it came down to something like
P.J.'s Cable/? vs. Ty's Cable/Iceman or something like that. It was
probably the worst match I've ever seen....BOTH players who are usually
on the ball, missed about 10 AHVB each instead getting just FPs or
stupid-looking rising FP viper beams......the match ended with P.J.
doing a standing short->RH chain into HVB, and for some reason that I
still can't understand, the HVB didn't connect but was able to be
blocked....Ty countered with his own HVB and it was peace out for
Essex.
Another spectacular match was Ryan Lee (Strider/Doom/StormCammyCable?)
vs. Brian Jin (Doom/Cable/Cyke?). Well in short it was a pretty typical
match, with the Strider/Doom trap in effect until Jin's Cyke Anti-air
assist stopping it and leading into AHVB combos....a LOT of DHCing left
both fighters with only Doom remaining, with about 75% life. Truly a
mirror match for the ages, both immediately SJed and tried
photons....which canceled each other out perfectly...so both went for a
photon array, which cancelled each other out perfectly.....and the
fight continued on the ground. Lots of blocked ground chains.
Eventually Jin got Ryan's Doom into an air combo finishing with a
photon array, but Ryan SJed again.....Jin tried to photon charge him on
the way up but missed...and Ryan basically did a photon array directly
into Doom's face. Ouch. Peace out, by pixels, an excellent match.

At some point during the night, I fought Ty Pathammavong, and I really
can't remember much besides that I dominated him. Don't ask me why Cen
ranked him and not me, I mean I respect his skills and all but there's
just no reason why he should be ranked while I'm just ignored. Maybe
because I was giving Cen shit the other night about banning the winner
of a match from switching their character order at the CTF tourney on
Sunday. Whatever.

Anyways, I had to fight Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron) to
fight for who would be the top contender, and who would fight the
winner of the losers' bracket for 2nd place. Richie is good, no doubt,
and I respect his skills: the first match was typical: he rarely misses
an AHVB, he uses Cyke anti-air assist very well to break traps, and to
my surprise his Cable OWNS my Doom. Whenever I tried to superjump and
throw photons...he would be there with me about 90% of the time, viper
beaming or AHVBing me out of them. Its friggin annoying. I wasn't
planning on using Blackheart at all, so for the second match I was
forced to try to use my Cable to beat his...which usually is no problem
with my team of Cable/Doom/Cyke. But then he pulled out the secret
weapon for Cable vs. Cable mirror matches: the Tron projectile assist.
I knew that for some reason the assist did ridiculous damage, but I had
no clue how good it was as an assist for Cable. You see, usually since
you can't do anything to Cable when the match starts because they both
have meter, it becomes jumping RH, assist matchup, until someone messes
up and gets cought with a AHVB. His damned Tron would come out and make
me block, and during that time he would jump over and cross me up with
a RH, then combo into a standing short->RH->HVB combo. Ouchie. So the
next time I tried to call out Cyke to stop Tron...he ate about 30%
damage from Tron, in addition to a AHVB from Cable. I couldn't counter
(you CAN'T counter AHVBs) so basically he got the damage for free. It
seemed like no matter what I did he couldn't be stopped.....either
Tron/Cable chipped, or connected for big damage, or my assist hit but
paid the price. The match was over, I'd lost.

So I had to fight Ryan Lee, of all people, for 2nd place. We have a
long-standing rivalry of who is the best in our area, and lately is has
been undoubtedly me, with my Doom owning him about 90% of the time. But
Ryan had been watching Richie fight me, so I figured it would be unsafe
to pick Doom and have him copy what Richie was doing with Cable....so I
took Blackheart out of retirement and used Cyke/Cable/BH against his
Strider/Storm/Doom. Decent match, but I owned since about 90% of the
time I can shut down his Srider with a ducking FP over and over and
over....then if he teleports, jump back RH with Cable Anti-air
assist....Strider basically got shut down and died. Storm came out, ate
a lot of Cyke AAA->AHVB combos and died. Doom just gave up, heh. The
second match was a lot better, with Ryan's classic "rushdown" team of
Strider/Cammy/Storm if I'm not mistaken. He beat me that one, mainly
because I had a brain fart and missed about 4 AHVBs, coming out with
dumb jumping attacks instead. The final match was also very
intense....basically a mirror match of the last one, I wasn't willing
to give up so easily. This time his Strider did a little more damage to
me....but I still shut him down. His Cammy was doing a good number on
my Cyke somehow, so I got Cable in there...which is usually a good
move, except that I forgot that Storm's projectile assist combined with
Cammy's jumping cannon drill is nearly unstoppable...and that Hail
Storm PUNISHES whiffed helpers...since Cyke was already low on health
there was little I could do........ eventually I called out Cyke by
accident and he died to a hail Storm, bleeh. So it was my Cable and BH
(both about 50%) against his Cammy and Storm. Cammy's Anti-air assist
caught Cable and AGAIN Ryan comboed into hailstorm....cable had about a
pixel of energy left...so by total luck, I landed a standing FP and
comboed into a BH swtich. I was almost shutting down Storm, but she was
tagging me a few times pretty good....a lot of times I did Infernos and
tried to cancel into Heart of Darkness, but instead I got nothing (cuz
of the fuqued diagonal controls) and ended up eating the lighting
attack-> electric storm combo. finally Ryan caught my BH with and air
combo, did a lighting attack in the combo, and tried to do an electric
storm....but then HE messed up because of the controls and the super
came out late....BH landed, did an Inferno, and this time the HOD
cancel worked....PEACE OUT STORM by pixels. Cammy came out with only a
little chunk of health and quickly lost to BH/Cable. It was one of the
best matches I've ever been in, with Ryan leading, me coming back, then
Ryan coming back and almost winning (if he had gotten that Storm air
combo off it was over for me, it was just pure luck that he messed up)
and then me taking advantage of his mistake and taking the win. MUCH
respect for Ryan.

So again, it was me vs Richie for 1st place. At this point, the arcade
was sweltering because it has NO A/C ARG and I was tired out from
playing the grueling match against Ryan. Richie was all fresh and
cheery, and gave me a big smile. ARG. I drank about half of Speedy's
soda and slowly picked Cable/Cyke/BH to counter Richie's
Cable/Cyke/Tron. At first it was working, my jump back viperbeam +
inferno assist chip trap working, but then I tried to rush him
again...and started eating Tron assists...and ending up with only
BH/Cyke. BH made a TREMENDOUS comeback, defeating his Cyke and wittling
his Cable down to a sliver of energy....then his Cable AHVBed him out
of existense....then my Cyke with about 10% energy left jumped onto the
scene and defeated Cable with a single jumping RH. Finally, it was Tron
vs. Cyke, but his Tron still had about 40% life left to my 10%. I
caught him with about 2 blocked jump-back SOBs and made the energy
even....and then ate a standing jab->forward->lunch rush combo, losing
the match. HOW HUMILIATING.

Well it was the second match, and it would be the last one if I didn't
win....being stupid me, I totally forgot about the Doom/BH trap for
some reason and again went with Cable/Cyke/BH (I'm stubborn like
that)......and got owned. I tried to make my comeback with BH again,
but every time I tried to cancel an inferno into a HOD, BH would just
stand there stupidly and gaze back at me like I was retarded. Bastard.
He ate about 3 AHVBs and I was basically peaced out.

In short, I learned a lot of things today:
-Even if you are a better player, one assist or trap or strategy that
you don't know how to counter can shut you down. And if you're not used
to the controls, you're going to make stupid mistakes, so ALWAYS
PRACTICE BEFOREHAND.
-IMHO, Cable owns Doom. Just jump with him and VB/AHVB his
photons....if BH assist, jump with Doom and airblock it and wait for
Doom to try something....if he does try to throw photons, AHVB or
VB...if he doesn't you land before him and can now call your own helper
to mess up the order of the Doom/BH trap.
-Tron assist is annoying.
-Joysticks that are angled to the screen suck. So many people were
complaining, and so many people were missing such simple things like
AHVBs or Inferno->HOD cancels....
-Arcades need air conditioning. Especially when packed with about 50
people.
-I need more sleep.

Well in conclusion, many props to all the players I faced today,
including notably Black Rich, Ty, Speedy, that Andrew Kid from
Meriden......special props to Ryan for always giving me excellent
competition in tournaments (I finally came out on top this time, heh,
and I didn't even re-enter to beat you!).....and an extra-special GOOD
JOB to Richie for playing MvsC2 so much that he learned how to shut
down my Cable with a simple Tron assist. That's one-one now Richie.
Next time, it will be for keeps.....

***Finally, I hope to play a lot of you at CTF this Sunday for the
100Hits MvsC2 tournament. Good luck to all the contenders and hope to
see you all there.***

If you're afraid of Cable beam cheese, then DON'T go to CTF. I can tell you
right now, it will be a total waste of your time using your Guile/Ryu/Strider
team. You must be used to fighting straight-up, while the rest of the country
is busy with Cable AHVBs and Strider/Doom traps.....not to mention Doom/BH,
Sentinel/BH, jump back fierce with Doom, etc. I'm just warning you, you'll be
disappointed.
Behold the true power of the Darksyde...

Today there was a tournament in Meriden....a full state tournament for MvsC2 in
Connecticut....this is my log of my personal experiences during the tournament.

The tournament was a surprising success. Even though it was delayed a week
(because a button broke last week and the arcade employees were unable to fix
it), I think it was honestly the best MvsC2 tournament that has been held in
CT. I think just about EVERBODY was there....around 40 people...with the
exception of maybe Bobby, Shoubert, Rob Aponte, and Dru....but without a doubt
there were people there to take their place anyway. Due to LOTS of traffic
delays (the Merritt Parkway was backed up for about a half hour), the
tournament started an hour late. The matches were different from last week: to
save time, all matches up to the semi-finals would be single fights, while the
semis would be best 2 out of 3. Well the tournament started out typically, with
regulars like P.J. (Essex on IRC)(Spiral/Magneto/?), me (Darksyde)
(Doom/Cyke/Cable), Ryan Lee (Strider/Cyclops/Doom), Brian Jin
(Strider/Doom/Cable), Rich Williams (Cable/Magneto/Iron Man), Richie from
Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron), a kid named Andrew from Meriden (Magneto/Iron
Man/?), and others winning their first round matches without much of a hitch,
quickly weeding out most of the scrubs. But to a lot of people's surpirse, some
of the more favored players actually LOST their first round matches...Kev
(Cammy/Storm/Commando) and others. Why? Well let me explain something about the
controllers at Meriden Arcade (Jester's Courtyard). They're DIAGONAL FROM THE
SCREEN. That's right, they are diagonal, forcing you to look at the game from
an awkward angle. Let me explain in more detail:

The face of the controls on a normal cabinet is set up like this:

l joy1 buttons joy2 buttons l
l________________________________l

coinslot coinslot

But at Meriden arcade, it's set up like this:
\ /
\ joy1(angled) buttons(angled) /
\ buttons(ang.) joy2(angled) /
\______________________________/
coinslot coinslot

So basically, you're forced to stand diagonally to play the game. Why is this
bad? Because most players, by reflex, try to correct their stance to face the
game straight during a heated match.....forcing them to hold the joystick
wrong....and miss simple moves like AHVB or just blocking low. A LOT of people
were complaining about this, and it was very evident that during about 90% of
the matches, at some point someone would miss something that should have
connected, simply because they were not used to the controls. I thought the
loose sticks at ECC2000 were ghey, until I went to Meriden and saw the Clown
Machine.

Anyways....
Trying to remember some of the better matches and strategies...
It seemed like in general people wanted to take a break from Blackheart, I was
the only person in the entire tournament to use him. Most of the winning teams
instead consisted of Doom/Cable/Cyke/Strider combinations. There really wasn't
much new to see, besides that Cable is still a royal pain in the ass, and that
besides Cable and Commando, Doom really doesn't have any bad matches to speak
of. Some notable moments:
I think it was P.J. against Ty Pathammavong (who is, by the way, the ONLY
person ranked in CT on the CTF website for the MvsC2 100 hits tourney this
Sunday....and he told me he isn't even going, wtf) in the semi-finals of the
losers bracket......it came down to something like P.J.'s Cable/? vs. Ty's
Cable/Iceman or something like that. It was probably the worst match I've ever
seen....BOTH players who are usually on the ball, missed about 10 AHVB each
instead getting just FPs or stupid-looking rising FP viper beams......the match
ended with P.J. doing a standing short->RH chain into HVB, and for some reason
that I still can't understand, the HVB didn't connect but was able to be
blocked....Ty countered with his own HVB and it was peace out for Essex.
Another spectacular match was Ryan Lee (Strider/Doom/StormCammyCable?) vs.
Brian Jin (Doom/Cable/Cyke?). Well in short it was a pretty typical match, with
the Strider/Doom trap in effect until Jin's Cyke Anti-air assist stopping it
and leading into AHVB combos....a LOT of DHCing left both fighters with only
Doom remaining, with about 75% life. Truly a mirror match for the ages, both
immediately SJed and tried photons....which canceled each other out
perfectly...so both went for a photon array, which cancelled each other out
perfectly.....and the fight continued on the ground. Lots of blocked ground
chains. Eventually Jin got Ryan's Doom into an air combo finishing with a
photon array, but Ryan SJed again.....Jin tried to photon charge him on the way
up but missed...and Ryan basically did a photon array directly into Doom's
face. Ouch. Peace out, by pixels, an excellent match.

At some point during the night, I fought Ty Pathammavong, and I really can't
remember much besides that I dominated him. Don't ask me why Cen ranked him and
not me, I mean I respect his skills and all but there's just no reason why he
should be ranked while I'm just ignored. Maybe because I was giving Cen shit
the other night about banning the winner of a match from switching their
character order at the CTF tourney on Sunday. Whatever.

Anyways, I had to fight Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron) to fight for
who would be the top contender, and who would fight the winner of the losers'
bracket for 2nd place. Richie is good, no doubt, and I respect his skills: the
first match was typical: he rarely misses an AHVB, he uses Cyke anti-air assist
very well to break traps, and to my surprise his Cable OWNS my Doom. Whenever I
tried to superjump and throw photons...he would be there with me about 90% of
the time, viper beaming or AHVBing me out of them. Its friggin annoying. I
wasn't planning on using Blackheart at all, so for the second match I was
forced to try to use my Cable to beat his...which usually is no problem with my
team of Cable/Doom/Cyke. But then he pulled out the secret weapon for Cable vs.
Cable mirror matches: the Tron projectile assist. I knew that for some reason
the assist did ridiculous damage, but I had no clue how good it was as an
assist for Cable. You see, usually since you can't do anything to Cable when
the match starts because both cables have meter (you're fearing a AHVB), it
becomes a jumping RH, assist matchup, until someone messes up and gets cought
with a AHVB. His damned Tron would come out and make me block, and during that
time he would jump over and cross me up with a RH, then combo into a standing
short->RH->HVB combo. Ouchie. So the next time I tried to call out Cyke to stop
Tron...he ate about 30% damage from Tron, in addition to a AHVB from Cable. I
couldn't counter (you CAN'T counter AHVBs) so basically he got the damage for
free. It seemed like no matter what I did he couldn't be stopped.....either
Tron/Cable chipped, or connected for big damage, or my assist hit but paid the
price. The match was over, I'd lost.

So I had to fight Ryan Lee, of all people, for 2nd place. We have a
long-standing rivalry of who is the best in our area, and lately is has been
undoubtedly me, with my Doom owning him about 90% of the time. But Ryan had
been watching Richie fight me, so I figured it would be unsafe to pick Doom and
have him copy what Richie was doing with Cable....so I took Blackheart out of
retirement and used Cyke/Cable/BH against his Strider/Storm/Doom. Decent match,
but I owned since about 90% of the time I can shut down his Strider with a
ducking FP over and over and over..it pretty much prevents him from using
Oroborous or teleporting, and so he's forced to jump and block a AAA from
Cable, then I just start over again....then if he teleports, jump back RH with
Cable Anti-air assist....Strider basically got shut down and died. Storm came
out, ate a lot of Cyke AAA->AHVB combos and died. Doom just gave up, heh. The
second match was a lot better, with Ryan's classic "rushdown" team of
Strider/Cammy/Storm if I'm not mistaken. He beat me that one, mainly because I
had a brain fart and missed about 4 AHVBs, coming out with dumb jumping attacks
instead. The final match was also very intense....basically a mirror match of
the last one, I wasn't willing to give up so easily. This time his Strider did
a little more damage to me....but I still shut him down. His Cammy was doing a
good number on my Cyke somehow, so I got Cable in there...which is usually a
good move, except that I forgot that Storm's projectile assist combined with
Cammy's jumping cannon drill is nearly unstoppable...and that Hail Storm
PUNISHES whiffed helpers...since Cyke was already low on health there was
little I could do........ eventually I called out Cyke by accident and he died
to a hail Storm, bleeh. So it was my Cable and BH (both about 50%) against his
Cammy and Storm. Cammy's Anti-air assist caught Cable and AGAIN Ryan comboed
into hailstorm....cable had about a pixel of energy left...so by total luck, I
landed a standing FP and comboed into a BH swtich. I was almost shutting down
Storm with jumping RHs, but she was tagging me a few times pretty good....a lot
of times I did Infernos and tried to cancel into Heart of Darkness, but instead
I got nothing (cuz of the fuqued diagonal controls) and ended up eating the
lighting attack-> electric storm combo. finally Ryan caught my BH with an air
combo, did a lighting attack in the combo, and tried to do an electric
storm....but then HE messed up because of the controls and the super came out
late....BH landed, did an Inferno, and this time the HOD cancel worked....PEACE
OUT STORM by pixels. Cammy came out with only a little chunk of health and
quickly lost to BH/Cable. It was one of the best matches I've ever been in,
with Ryan leading, me coming back, then Ryan coming back and almost winning (if
he had gotten that Storm air combo off it was over for me, it was just pure
luck that he messed up) and then me taking advantage of his mistake and taking
the win. MUCH respect for Ryan.

So again, it was me vs Richie for 1st place. At this point, the arcade was
sweltering because it has NO A/C ARG and I was tired out from playing the
grueling match against Ryan. Richie was all fresh and cheery, and gave me a big
smile. ARG. I drank about half of Speedy's soda and slowly picked Cable/Cyke/BH
to counter Richie's Cable/Cyke/Tron. At first it was working, my jump back
viperbeam + inferno assist keepaway in full effect, but then I tried to rush
him again...and started eating Tron assists...and ending up with only BH/Cyke.
BH made a TREMENDOUS comeback, defeating his Cyke and wittling his Cable down
to a sliver of energy....then his Cable AHVBed him out of existense....then my
Cyke with about 10% energy left jumped onto the scene and defeated Cable with a

Okay. I won my first 2 matches, lost my third, then won my fourth, but lost my
5th to Eddie Lee. Am I like tied for 16th or something?

The whole truth of the throwing issue is, people used to consider them "cheap"
in the original SF2 series because:

1. Some characters had huge throw range
2. Originally the throws were inescapable, and since there were no rolls,
sometimes you were instantly sent up for another throw....and
3. Throws did huge amounts of damage

Basically, throws could ruin the gameplay of the original SF2 games just
because it took away from actual fighting....whether than trying to figure out
how to do a nice combo, you would try to figure out how to throw effectively.

But now throws are totally different. For the most part, throw range is minimal
in SF and versus games. Throws usually only do about 8-10% damage (with some
exceptions, like Commando's in MvsC2 which usually does about 15%, but even
then that's not a huge amount). And now nobody has any reason to complain,
because throws can be tech hit out of for a large window of time, and even if
you miss the tech, you can roll out of most of them to safety. Somebody was
complaining about you throwing in MvsC2? That just proves their level of
scrubbiness is higher than the average Guile player.

Okay, here is what I can remember from the Chinatown fair MvsC2 tournament that
took place on August 27th...

It all started at 8AM, when I rushed to the mall to meet Rob Aponte and others,
so we could all go to NYC on the train and compete in the MvsC2 tournament at
CTF, starting at 12 noon. Well I showed up, and Germaine was the only person
there at that point. Soon Mario and P.J. showed up....and that was it. We were
like what the hell? So Mario called Rob....who hadn't gotten up yet. Oh great,
so a guy that can't even get up when like 6 people are depending on him, is
gonna be our leader in NYC? Arg. Well anyways we had about an hour to kill
while we were waiting for Rob to come...so I went and picked up Ryan and Speedy
(bums without rides). We all met back at the mall around 9 and departed...to
stop 5 seconds later, because Speedy's MacDonald's breakfast had spilled sticky
syrup all over everybody in Rob's car (luckily I was in Germaine's car because
I'm smart). Well after much pants cleaning, we were on our way...to getting
lost in Fairfield. Seriously, nobody really knew where the damned train station
was, I don't know why we didn't just go to the Bridgeport station, but
whatever. We finally found it and took the 10:27 to Grand Central. About an
hour and a half ride, but it was all good considering there were a good number
of us and we all had stuff to talk about. From Grand Central we took the #6
subway into Chinatown (Canal ST.) and Chinatown Fair was only one street
away...we stopped at MacDonalds first because we all had to take a major piss
and chow down, then we headed on to the arcade. We arrived at about 12:30.

The arcade was already full of people, but it wasn't very crowded yet. Not much
for us to do but sign up....and get a little practice in. We met up with Black
Rich, Rob Constant, and Brian Jin inside CTF, but team Waterbury didn't show
up...chickened out like the scrubs they are? maybe. Anyways, I headed over to a
MvsC2 machine to find Seiya (a 12 year old Boston player and regular on IRC,
who talks LOTS of shit) dominating some scrubs. So I headed over and put my
coin up...and told him NOT to lose before I got up, so we could have our fabled
match. Alas, Seiya was peaced out by Connecticut's own Brian Jin right before
my turn.....UWAHAHAH. Anyway I felt bad so I let one of Seiya's crew play
against Brian...and he won with a weak team that had Gambit, heh. So then I
played and tested him to see what he had...not much besides chipping traps.
Which I quickly broke, and it was fairly simple to come back considering I had
Cable. A good warm-up, but nothing special.

The tournament finally started, with a total of 66 entrants. Very cramped, very
sweaty, very smelly, very LITTLE AC, wtf. Anyways, the sticks were perfect,
much better than the ones at ECC2k, so I had nothing to complain about.
Generally Connecticut got owned, like I figured most of them would, considering
Ryan and I beat them down on a regular basis. I'm not going to go into
super-details about all the Connecticut matches because to be perfectly honest,
i can't remember most of the ones i wasn't in. You should probably ask those
players themselves about their matches. But here's what I can remember:

Rob Aponte won like one match, then his Sentinel/War Machine/Iron Man
combinations pretty much got dominated by everybody he faced. Right before a
crucial fight with Chocobo (Joe from Virginia, another IRC regular who is
deceptively better than he looks), I warned him not to underestimate him. But I
doubt he could help it: Chocobo does look like a skinny scrubby white kid,
especially wearing that strange green shirt, it looked like he just got off of
work serving tables at a restaurant or something. Anyways, to make it short,
Rob got his ass whupped, got really disappointed, and all of a sudden he wanted
to go home. Heh. Understandable I guess considering how uncomfortable it was
being inside there with all those people.

Ryan Lee did a lot better than I think he expected...he made it to the fourth
round before he got peaced out. I can't really remember who he fought, but I'm
sure a few of his matches were pretty good. I do remember his one fight with
Justin, where he dominated the first game with Strider alone....and Team CT
almost got kicked out for cheering for him. Heh, whatever, that threat didn't
last too long, apologies were made, and everything was cool. Then Ryan lost the
next 2 matches to Justin....must have lost his groove. Oh well, I would soon
know what that would be like myself.

My first match was against Todd Dwyer, who if any of you somehow don't know,
has basically run ECC for the past few years because he works at 8 on the Break
in New Jersey. Well he straight out told me that he doesn't play the game much,
and I believed him....picking Silver Samurai and Captain American against my
Doom/Cable/Cyke/BH teams??? Suicide dood. Sorry to beat you so badly but I had
to do it.

My next match was tough, and would prove my skills to the world: Josh W.
(Strider/Doom/BH?), a CTF regular and frequent sparring partner of Arturo and
company. Basically the matches consisted of trying to out-Doom each other, so I
knew it would be tough. The first match he pretty much dominated me, I wasn't
ready for his kind of skill yet. But I learned fast, and the second match I had
my Doom/BH traps going pretty well. He managed to come back and wipe out both
my Doom and Blackheart, leaving only Cable behind...then with only 1 second
remaining he called his Strider assist, and I AHVBed on reaction....killing
Strider and getting the last second win. The third match was almost like the
first, only the opposite...my traps were now in full effect and Josh was having
trouble getting out of them. I won that one without much trouble, and to my
surprise, I had won a relatively tough fight.

At this point I was starving, and I hate Chinese food, so I went across the
street and bought an iced tea for myself. Good enough for now, heh.

My third match was against a guy from Boston named Alex Koo. I had never heard
of him and had no idea how he played...so I picked my usual starting team of
Doom/Cable/Cyke only to face a deadly combination of Sentinel/Juggernaut/?.
Anyways the third character wasn't very important, his Sentinel and Juggernaut
were enough to handle on their own. His Sent was almost flawless, keeping me
pinned with the FP->Hyper Sentinel Force->FP->Sentinel Force->FP-> Rocket punch
etc. shutdown trap working pretty well. There are almost no Sentinels in
Connecticut so I was kind of at a loss of what to do....I tried doing photons
with doom but he started whacking me out of the air with Sentinel, by flying
above me and stomping....its damned hard to get up there with any of the guys I
had. I lost the first match pretty badly, so for the second match I used
Doom/Cable/BH, I figured that Blackheart assist would be enough to keep
Sentinel on the ground...WRONG. Every time I tried to call him out, he would
eat a massive Juggernaut punch from a Powerup-glitched jugs for about 40%
damage...combine that with Sentinel juggling him with the FPs and HSFs, and he
was toast. Well I got mad, I didn't want to go out without a fight, so I did my
best....many AHVBs and photon arrays later, it left my 5% doom against his 40%
Juggernaut. I had a super, hee hee. I did the only thing I could do: chip a
little until he got a super and I feared a headcrush. Time was at like 2
seconds, so I quickly did a full-screen covering jumping RH which somehow
crossed up Jugs...then I cancelled into photon array and mashed like crazy. I
watched and mashed my brains out....the energy going down down down...and
stopping at about 4%. SHIT I yelled out, what do I do now? I'm going to fall
right into a headcrush, why won't time run out?!?! All you can do after a
photon array at that point is airdash somewhere....and me being a total idiot,
instead of airdashing OVER him, I dashed backwards....giving him even more time
to do the headcrush and kill me with zero seconds remaining. Oh well. Pretty
damn good match for my first loss, and Alex went on to take 3rd place, so I
didn't feel so bad.

After that match, I needed food bad, in any possible form available. So I went
back across the street to the market with my friend Speedy and bought a huge
bag of shrimp-flavored chips, and some cookie-type sticks covered in chocolate
called Pocky. Chinese sure have a weird sense of taste. The Pocky were blazin'
tho.

My next match was against some guy named Yul Kun or something like that, I
really don't know where he was from, but he wasn't bad. We both picked
variations of a Doom/Cable/Cyke team, and to make it short, I out-cheaped him.
Heh he was disappointed but it was a good fight overall, and I moved on to the
fifth round...

I figured since i was going to fight Eddie Lee next (oh boy, time for me to get
peaced out) I went across the street to use the bathroom somewhere before my
bladder exploded. I went into some Chinese restaurant and asked to use the
bathroom. The Chinese guy said something really loud to me in Chinese, like I
understand him, wtf. So I just went to the back and used the restroom. When I
came out, I said thank you to the guy on the way out of the restaurant, and he
gave me a look that just said "I want to cut off one of your body parts with a
huge cleaver. Welcome to Chinatown."

Well my match against Eddie was next. At this point the rest of Connecticut had
been eliminated (cuz most of them sucked, heh) and I planned to go out soon as
well. I was already hella tired, but if I could keep winning, I sure as hell
wasn't going to give up now. The match was my Doom/Cable/BH against his
Strider/Doom/BH. First match, he tried to do some Strider/Doom trapping on
me...I used Cable anti-air to get out, and then started my own Doom/BH
trapping...basically I got a lot of AHVBs out on reaction....and through a lot
of good timing, I won pretty convincingly. Eddie was just kind of amazed, he
seemed almost in a trance for a second after the match ended. Arturo came up to
him, and actually said something like "Eddie, if you lose to Phil, you do
realize that your SF days are over, right?" I think that gave Eddie the drive
he needed. Next match I made a lot of mistakes, and Eddie capitalized on them,
punishing me appropriately and winning the match even more convincingly than I
won the first. Now it was really on, everybody was watching our match
intensely. The final match was probably one of the best matches I've ever
played. We went back and forth, each catching each other with something or
another...I would AHVB, he would do a Strider/Doom trap for a while....I would
crossup Photon array, he would get me with a BH inferno->HOD. Finally it came
down to his Strider and BH, both at about 25%, to my Cable, which was about
35%, with about 12 seconds left. He was about to start attacking me (which is
exactly what I wanted, I needed him to make a mistake I could capitalize on and
then AHVB), but just then Arturo yelled out "TURTLE EDDIE TURTLE!!!" And so he
did. For 12 seconds, Strider super jumped, blocked, and teleported around my
Cable, leaving me with no options but to lose. A good fight, very close and
very down to the wire, but ultimately I think the better man won. An awesome
match, definitely.

At this point I said goodbye to Chinatown Fair and the rest of the 100 Hits
tournament. I was tired, dehydrated, starving, sweating like a pig, and almost
out of money. I didn't get home until about 3AM because my ride "didn't want to
pay a toll" to get back to Connecticut so instead got lost in Yonkers and
wasted about 5 times the toll in gas money....but I was happy that I had come
and represented the skills that I knew I had but could never prove just online
or on IRC. After defeating Josh and almost eliminating Eddie Lee, I don't think
ANYONE can call me monkeyspank anymore and mean it other than jokingly. The
tournament was in my opinion a success, and although I hear that the CTF
regulars all clowned out in the finals, leaving 2 Boston heads and a CTF
"scrub" to take the top three. Whatever, it happens. Much respect for the
Boston people who for the MOST PART represented (cough cough SEIYA cough PEACED
OUT cough). Props to the CTF regulars who although made mistakes, still gave
kick-ass comp. FlashG, if you keep doing those Oro dizzies/juggles on me in
3s....I'm going to complain even more. And lost of thanks to Henry Cen and all
the others who ran the tournament fairly well, with only a few delays and NO
mishaps with controls or whatever. This tournament definitely is encouraging to
me, and now I'm going to make every effort I can to go to the MvsC2 Nationals
in Chicago in October.

As always, Nuff' said.

Behold the true power of the Darksyde...

I'm sure you're the expert on what was going on in my mind at that time. Well I
thought I AHVBed, maybe I'm not remembering correctly, maybe it was a ground
HVB, but does it really matter? I saw the opening, reacted, and got the win
because Josh made a mistake. Surprised look? Maybe it was from mashing the damn
beam so hard. Lucky? Um if people didn't make mistakes, which you seem to
consider "luck," then everyone would play perfectly and nobody would ever
win....always draw games. And if it was luck, how did I win the third match so
convincingly....more luck???
And by the way, who the hell are YOU to call me a scrub? I'm guessing there's a
99% chance you're from Boston. Seriously, Boston showed some excellent and
respectable skills at CTF, but you're just putting them to shame.

>Alex Koo posts here dumbass. And his third character is very important since
>it
>locked your ass down. It was BH. Sentinel, Juggernaut, and BH. BH does matter
>because he locks you down with his assist while Sentinel fires off his
>Sentinel
>Forces into Rocket Punches,etc.

Okay, now I'm a dumbass for not knowing that Alex posts here? STFU, you've
already proved your scrubbiness by trying to flame just because I'm not a
regular. As for BH being important, the assist is very important, but the fact
is that it didn't matter whether it was BH, or Cable's projectile assist, or
any other assist that would keep me on the ground for a second so he could
continue the Sentinel lockdown traps.....they all have the same effect. The
fact that it was specifically BH that did this, did not matter, which is
probably why I couldn't remember who the third character was.

I'm sure you would, considering you're a scrub yourself who flames to make
yourself feel better about your lack of skills.

Okay, if the guy that tried to flame me isn't from Boston, I apologize. I
wasn't trying to insult anybody from Boston, it's just that on the day this
flame showed up, Seiya was having a fit that I was insulting Boston or
something on IRC when I really wasn't. So I apologize if anybody from Boston
was offended, you guys represented and showed us some skills we weren't
expecting, good work.

Heh. I really don't know what you're talking about man. I haven't seen any
posts on this NG about Boston being lucky, or sucking, or whatever. It IS true
that top players like Justin and Eddie weren't playing as good as they should
have...you can't deny that. But that doesn't mean that you guys wouldn't have
won anyway....you guys definitely have skills that nobody was expecting, and we
respect you for that. I don't know why you think everybody is against you and
insulting you....cuz as far as I know, nobody is. Seiya was banned from IRC
because he kept complaining that people were insulting Boston....when really
nobody was, and finally we just got sick of him complaining, so he got banned.
And wtf, you say CT was cheering and everything and then got eliminated....no
kidding. I was saying in IRC for months that CT sucks, because we hardly even
play the game...usually like once or twice a week we run into each other at the
arcade and have good matches. And I NEVER talked shit saying I was the best on
the EC...I DID say that I was the best in CT, which is the truth since I got a
lot farther at CTF that any other CT player, beating Josh W. and having a close
match with Eddie. I know this isn't much, but it's something.

So...in conclusion, STOP WHINING. CTF is over, you guys won, yay. We understand
that you have skills and you're good...but we've been hearing about this for a
week now and we're kind of getting sick of it. Nobody is insulting you, nobody
is clowning you or saying that you got "lucky..." If you ask me, you guys are a
little paranoid yourselves that maybe it was just luck, and that's why you
think everybody is saying that. Well let me outright say it: IT WASN'T LUCK, IT
WAS SKILL. You happy now? Geez. If there is ever a Boston tourney (which Seiya
said there might be on IRC right before he got banned, heh), post about it here
so that we can go and see the true power of Boston on their home turf. I still
want my match with Seiya....
