## Supercard? (E_1nPLLVIAccT_A)
People completely missing the point, which of course I knew would happen,

The thing being called out here isn't that it's possible to get the amount of points the winners earned; in fact, if you played nonstop 24-hours-a-day you could potentially earn even more.
It's the SPPED they earned them in. As in, me activately vs. Mokai for 5th, playing nonstop for 2 hours, earning that just under 1800 points and then seeing his total jump by over 3000. It's physically impossible.

Jonathan, if that is really you posteding, you have to understand that the game showed you jumped in the THOUSANDS of points at a tear. If you're claiming you didn't cheat, that means the game is innately flawed and doesn't reflect points properly - which is a major problem for people vying for the top 5 spots. Could actually be a CatDaddy tactic to lure people into sinking more money into the game?

But ultimately, I don't believe you because you cclaim to be unable to take a screenshot on your mobile device. Yeah, no, if you spend as much time on it as you claim you'd be able to do that. Obviously other stuff at work here, and I think we need to have some changes to future PCCs.

Damn it. Got this lineup and I can only play the first hour bc of shitty timing

## Champions discord 2 E_-1wFfXIAYGhLq
My enemy is time. I have to be up in 4 hours to play lol

## Champions discord 3 E_-1wFfXIAYGhLq
Yeah shes my 3rd highest

## Champions discord 4 E_-1wFfXIAYGhLq
Holy crap. Even im shocked

## Champions discord 5 E_-1wFfXIAYGhLq
Sooo I got spammed by 3 people asking me if im darksydephil. One of them is that _ guy above. FYI apparently my name is the same as the twitter handle of some streamer and now I'm getting harassed by these people. Delightful.
ive had this name since the launch of the game so I have no idea why this is suddenly an issue

## Champions discord 6 E_-1wFfXIAYGhLq
Yeah i guess tahts who these people are joining the server??
i only started using discord a little over a year ago but i have no idea how just anyone could join and start spamming us. One idiot tried to call me like 100 times and screamed at me for saying i dont play mobile games. Christ

## Champions discord 7 E_-1xfSWEAYpiOW
@Donnybones if you dropped $1k or more and didnt get him i dont blame you. I got super burned in January on something and almost gave in then to. It shouldnt be super insane spending and still not guaranteed to get something.

## Champions discord 8 E_-1xfSWEAYpiOW
the "top guys" regularly spend $1-2k every time for a new superstar
So thats what Scopely now uses as the norm

## Champions discord 9 E_-1xfSWEAYpiOW
Thats why they started doing the "shard pulls" with HoF and then Kairi/Shenom. The top guys told them there was no way they were spending without a guarantee to get them. But now with Hogan they definitely wont do that
even in the biggest factions only a few are getting him so far

## Champions discord 10 E_-1xV6VgAY_0Lx
I just dumped money into buying mass belt parts to remove all the crappy belts and medals i put on people when belts first released.
Now i finally have inventory space again

## Champions discord 11 E_-1yMtWQAAjf7V
Oh hell yes, turn 1 killer of everything
he'll run through entire teams with the line bonus you get for having Drew

## Champions discord 12 E_-1yMtWQAAjf7V
i forgot they are even doing that

## Mod discord 1 E_lIrrxXEAsLtIG
A few FYIs for new mods
Sidella aka Vincent/pennywise etc is autistic. His parents have been harassed IRL at their jobs as a result of his watching my streams and arguing with trolls. Ive tried to tell him tons of times what is/isnt okay but due to his impairment he really doesnt get it. Which is why we've started banning his accounts when he gets out of hand, but he always comes back somehow
Rumlestiltskinz charged back between $200-300 in tips ranging back to September 2019 when we got permanently banned and i refused to lift it.

## Champions discord 13 FAi_liJXIAwVJVa
1.84 mil roster looking for a faction. You'd be insane to recruit me since a group of legitimately insane people think I'm someone I'm not and have followed me around for multiple months trolling me, despite my efforts to avoid them. You'll likely have your Discord flooded with trolls and get DOXXed in the process. But hey, if you're that kind of crazy, send me a DM

## Champions discord 14 FAi-l-r
Aw man, I cant feud!!! Oh wait, I'm not in a faction, that's why

## Champions discord 15 FAi-l-r
I heard that in town hall, the mods were dancing about, gyrating their new shiny tricker Big E's and flaunting their multiple 3 star Machos while feasting on in-game cash provided exclusively by Scopely!!!! /sarcasm
for reals, the town hall mods always stick up for everyone when stuff doesnt work. Notice nobody actually in town hall says this conspiracy theory stuff

## Champions discord 16 FAi-JVYWEA
I was a rep in town hall for a top 10 faction for many months. I had nothing but pleasant interactions with the mod staff and they always were on top of things when it meant getting info to Scopely about game bugs and issues. Many times they went to bat and had to argue for a better outcome when Scopely was tone deaf about a situation. As someone who was there for a while, I can tell you they are not just out for themselves and the top factions. Of course, you have to take MY word for it now, so its kind of the same deal I guess.
im currently in no faction at all so I have zero _ in saying this

## Champions discord 18 FAi-JwcX0a
i still wouldnt be welcome

God I guess when it comes to this game

lets just say my situation is unique and leave it at that. Ill be the biggest solo player ever

## Champions discord 19 FAu7Y8mX0AABvM0
a spending ban can work if you have a consensus. Its obvious there are people with lots of money who dont care about game issues and will drop tons for lackluster new superstars just for some iota of feeling of accomplishment.
These people will be crushed once the game is shut down eventually, but Scopely knows they are the gas that runs the engine until then. So expect to see weekly new, crappy superstars and people dropping thousands for them everytime bc they are compulsive gamblers who cannot help themselves.
They probably dont even use the new guys, they just let them sit unleveled for dropping $3k to get them. Its the rush of getting that pull/fuse that they paid for, not the actual product

## Champions discord 20 FAu7ZJOXsAEAcUN
i dont care either, actually, and I'm not taking jabs at all. I'm stating facts. You will never get a spending ban to work when a group of compulsory gamblers are the people who are bankrolling the game. If we all cancel our monthly subs, Scopely makes pulls tougher to get (as they just did over the last 6 weeks) and adds more superstars so that group will just spend more. It's not a winnable battle sadly. I knew that from the get go
You cannot hate on the people spending to make the game keep going. If it werent for them this game may have shut down by now
but you also cant institute a spending ban and expect it to work when those people are not all on the same page. We saw big spending in weekly contests when the ban was in effect and that likely negated any positive impact. It's sad but true. You either can accept how things are now or move on, IMO

## Champions discord 21 FAu7ZQUX
Hey, appreciate the convo but likely you wont want me on your faction as trolls who think im some streamer are stalking me and will likely flood your discord. Thats what got me kicked from my last faction and why nobody will pick me up

## Champions discord 22 FBRiV01WQAQ
Hey all, I'd like to introduce myself. I've been in and out of this faction a few tiems under different names in the last 1-2 months. I have one of the biggest rosters in the game and was formerly on the council of a top 5 faction. I have one of the biggest rosters in the game and was formerly on the council of a top 5 faction. That all changed when a group of internet trolls mistook me for someone else, some idiot video game streamer that they hate. They have stalked me since January, leading me to get kicked out of my faction for no good reason. I've changed my name in the game to no avail, as they still stalk and find me. So at this point, i'm done running and am going to stay with Road Warriorz for the foreseeable future. If you have any questions regarding builds for superstars or roster advice, I'm your guy as I have about 98% of them!

## Mod discord 2 th-3123477552
Wtf. Did i NOT JUST SAY TO NOT GET INVOLVED IN THIS DRAMA
why the fuck are you reading detractor tweets and kiwifarms???
you're a mod on my streams, you dont work for the CIA. Nobody wants you going down into the toilet for thsi shit and you shouldnt give a damn about it. Its my job to make determinations about stream chatters and contributors
This is a major problem. This is why shit gets leaked. Bc we have mods that are up to their eyeballs in this drama shit for no reason

## Mod discord 3 th-3411716872
hes terrified of being doxxed. He saw my neighbors get doxxed and deleted all his shit lol
he just told me
he knows the trolls are after him
I told him he should just enjoy the streams anonymously from now on and not worry about contributions if its going to make him worry so much

## Mod discord 3 unknown
Bc thats the fun of it. It makes them beg. It lowers them to a level where they know they cant troll anymore bc its an instant ban. And thats exactly what we're going for. You humble the troublemakers into submission and then the rest get in line

You know he'll be banend again. Just like Kozatof and the others
